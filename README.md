Information Retrieval Project

1-2 page proposal:
 - brief descriptive title of your project
 
Address these questions:
 - What is exactly the function of your tool? That is, what will it do? Have another resource to access Utah's legislative bills with social-media (emoticons for user response) type features to help users learn more about bills
 - Why would we need such a tool and who would you expect to use it and benefit from it? Utah politics can seem inaccessible and there are a lot of bills that get passed, this would help people who want to be involved to access information more easily. 
- Does this kind of tools already exist? If similar tools exist, how is your tool different from them? Would people care about the   difference? How hard is it to build such a tool? What is the challenge? 
- How do you plan to build it? You should mention the data you will use and the core algorithm that you will implement. Our core algorithms will be 1. k-means to classify the bills in clusters, and 2. search using tf-idf sorting.
- What existing resources can you use?
- How will you demonstrate the usefulness of your tool?
