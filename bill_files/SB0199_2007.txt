classifications related to the nature and the degree of the risk covered or the expenses involved.

    (b)  Rates are not unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among persons
            
649

    
insured under a group, blanket, or franchise policy, and the terms of those policies are not

policies.

    (B)  a monopoly in that business; or

671

    
state is not a reasonable ground for disapproval, and the commissioner may by rule specify
            
672

    
additional grounds that are not reasonable.  This Subsection (5) does not bar an insurer from
            
673

    
declining an application for insurance.

            
674

unfair method of competition or any other unfair or deceptive act or practice after a finding that
            
695

    
they:
