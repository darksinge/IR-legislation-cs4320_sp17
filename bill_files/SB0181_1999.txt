     35A-4-307.  Social costs -- Relief of charges.
            

    
    (1)  Social costs shall consist of those benefit costs defined as follows:
            

    
    (a)  Benefit costs of an individual will not be charged to a base-period employer, but will
            

    
be considered social costs if the individual's separation from that employer occurred under any of
            

    
the following circumstances:
            

    
    (i)  the individual was discharged by the employer or voluntarily quit employment with the
            

    
employer for disqualifying reasons, but subsequently requalified for benefits and actually received
            

    
benefits;
            

    
    (ii)  the individual received benefits following a quit which was not attributable to the
            

    
employer; [or]
            

    
    (iii)  the individual received benefits following a discharge for nonperformance due to
            

    
medical reasons[.]; or
            

    
    (iv)  the individual received benefits while attending the first week of mandatory

            

    
apprenticeship training.
            

    
    (b)  Social costs are benefit costs which are or have been charged to employers who have
            

    
terminated coverage and are no longer liable for contributions, less the amount of contributions paid
            

    
by such employers during the same time period.
            

    
    (c)  The difference between the benefit charges of all employers whose benefit ratio exceeds
            

    
the maximum overall contribution rate and the amount determined by multiplying the taxable payroll
            

    
of the same employers by the maximum overall contribution rate is a social cost.
            

    
    (d)  Benefit costs attributable to a concurrent base-period employer will not be charged to that
            

    
employer if the individual's customary hours of work for that employer have not been reduced.
            

    
    (e)  Benefit costs incurred during the course of division-approved training which occurs after
            

    
December 31, 1985, will not be charged to base-period employers.
            

    
    (f)  Benefit costs will not be charged to employers if such costs are attributable to:
            

    
    (i)  the state's share of extended benefits;
            

    
    (ii)  uncollectible benefit overpayments;
            

    
    (iii)  the proportion of benefit costs of combined wage claims that are chargeable to Utah
            

    
employers and are insufficient when separately considered for a monetary eligible claim under Utah
            

    
law and which have been transferred to a paying state; and
            

    
    (iv)  benefit costs attributable to wages used in a previous benefit year that are available for
            

    
a second benefit year under Subsection 

35A-4-401

(2) because of a change in method of computing
            

    
base-periods, overlapping base-periods, or for other reasons required by law.
            

    
    (g)  Any benefit costs that are not charged to an employer and not defined in this subsection
            

    
are also social costs.
            

    
    (2)  Subsection (1) applies only to contributing employers and not to employers that have
            

    
elected to finance the payment of benefits in accordance with Section 

35A-4-309

 or 

35A-4-311

in an active effort to secure employment, except as provided in Subsection (3).
            

    
    (d)  The individual has been unemployed for a waiting period of one week with respect to

    (ii)  Subsection (1)(e) does not apply if the individual proves to the satisfaction of the
            

    
division that the individual had good cause for failing to furnish the information.
            

    
    (iii)  If any employer fails to furnish reports concerning separation and employment as
            

    
required by this chapter and rules adopted under the chapter, the division shall on the basis of such
            

    
information as it may obtain, determine the eligibility and insured status of any individual affected
            

    
by that failure and the employer is not considered to be an interested party to any such determination.
            

    
    (f)  The individual's base period wages were at least 1-1/2 times the individual's wages for
            

    
insured work paid during that quarter of the individual's base period in which the individual's wages

employment experience in the individual's base period meet the requirements specified in Subsection
            

    
(1)(f).
            

    
    (2) (a)  An individual in training with the approval of the division is not ineligible to receive

[or] failure to apply for or to accept suitable work, or not having been unemployed for a waiting

of this Subsection (2)(a), the division shall approve any mandatory apprenticeship-related training.
            

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no otherwise eligible individual

for work, or refusal to accept work.
            

    
    (c)  For purposes of this Subsection (2), "suitable employment" means work of a substantially
            

    
equal or higher skill level than the individual's past adversely affected employment, as defined for
            

    
purposes of the Trade Act of 1974, and wages for that work at not less than 80% of the individual's
            

    
average weekly wage as determined for the purposes of the Trade Act of 1974.
            

    
    (3)  The department may, by rule, waive or alter either or both of the requirements of
            

    
Subsections (1)(a) and (b) as to individuals attached to regular jobs and as to other types of cases or

situations with respect to which it finds that compliance with the requirements would be oppressive,
            

    
or would be inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter as long as the rules do not conflict with
            

    
Subsection
