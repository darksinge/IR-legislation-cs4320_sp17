By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                            Procedures Act, the division may immediately deny, suspend, disqualify, or revoke the license of                            any person without hearing and without receiving a record of the person s conviction of crime                            when the division has been notified or has reason to believe the person                                     a   has committed any offenses for which mandatory suspension or revocation of a license                            is required upon conviction under Section                                                   b   has, by reckless or unlawful driving of a motor vehicle, caused or contributed to an                            accident resulting in death or injury to any other person, or serious property damage                                  c   is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle or is afflicted with mental or physical                            infirmities or disabilities rendering it unsafe for the person to drive a motor vehicle upon the                            highways                                  d   has committed a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws of this state                                  e   has permitted an unlawful use of the license as defined in Section                   or                                 f   has been convicted of serious offenses against traffic laws governing the movement of                            motor vehicles with a frequency that indicates a disrespect for traffic laws and a disregard for the                            safety of other persons on the highways.                                     a   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     when the                            person has failed to comply with the terms stated on a traffic citation issued in this state, except                            this Subsection     does not apply to highway weight limit violations or violations of law                            governing the transportation of hazardous materials.                                 b   This Subsection     applies to parking and standing violations only if a court has issued                            a warrant for the arrest of a person for failure to post bail, appear, or otherwise satisfy the terms                            of the citation.                                 c   i   This Subsection     may not be exercised unless notice of the pending suspension                            of the driving privilege has been mailed at least ten days previously to the person at the address                            provided to the division.                                 ii   After clearance by the division, a report authorized by Section                  may not                            contain any evidence of a suspension that occurred as a result of failure to comply with the terms                            stated on a traffic citation.                                     a   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     when the                            division has been notified by a court that the person has an outstanding unpaid fine, an outstanding                            incomplete restitution requirement, or an outstanding warrant levied by order of a court.                                 b   The suspension remains in effect until the division is notified by the court that the order                            has been satisfied.                                 c   After clearance by the division, a report authorized by Section                  may not                               contain any evidence of the suspension.                                     The division shall make rules establishing a point system as provided for in this                            subsection.                                 a   i   The division shall assign a number of points to each type of moving traffic violation                            as a measure of its seriousness.                                 ii   The points shall be based upon actual relationships between types of traffic violations                            and motor vehicle traffic accidents.                                 b   Every person convicted of a traffic violation shall have assessed against his driving                            record the number of points that the division has assigned to the type of violation of which the                            person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be decreased by                                if on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded the severity of violation                            as minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court has graded the severity of                            violation as maximum.                                 c   i   A separate procedure for assessing points for speeding offenses shall be established                            by the division based upon the severity of the offense.                                 ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as                                  A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to ten miles per hour                                  B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from    to    miles per hour                             and                                 C    maximum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by    or more miles per hour.                                 iii   Consideration shall be made for assessment of no points on minimum speeding                            violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.                                 d   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations                            occurring before a time limit set by the division.                                 ii   The time limit may not exceed three years.                                 iii   The division may also delete points to reward violation free driving for periods of                            time set by the division.                                 e   i   By publication in two newspapers having general circulation throughout the state,                            the division shall give notice of the number of points it has assigned to each type of traffic                            violation, the time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level at which                            the division will generally take action to deny or suspend under this section.                                    ii   The division may not change any of the information provided above regarding points                            without first giving new notice in the same manner.                                     a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the                            division shall immediately notify the licensee in writing and afford him an opportunity for a                            hearing in the county where the licensee resides.                                 ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may                            administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of                            relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.                                 iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision made                            after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made after a                            hearing before the full membership of the division.                                 iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,                            extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.                                 b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications                            determined by the division regarding a person                                  i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination                                  ii   who is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle                                  iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities that might make him dangerous                            on the highways  or                                 iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to drive a motor vehicle safely.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state upon                            receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed there                            that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a license.                                 b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                            nonresident driver of a motor vehicle of any offense under the motor vehicle laws of this state,                            forward a certified copy of the record to the motor vehicle administrator in the state where the                            person convicted is a resident.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a motor                            vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be suspended or                            revoked.                                 b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when his license has been                               suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                                     a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of more                            than one year except                                  i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                                      ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges                            under Section                                                   iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports under                            Subsection                      and                                 iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section                                  a        .                                 b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until he shows                            satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                                  c   Upon denying, suspending, or revoking a license, the division shall require that all                           license certificates held by the person be surrendered to the division.                                   d   At the end of the period of denial or suspension, the certificate surrendered shall be                           returned to the licensee.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                            Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any person without hearing                            and without receiving a record of his conviction for a crime when the division has reason to                            believe that the person s license was granted by the division through error or fraud or that the                            necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is terminated.                                 b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that after                            the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                      a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is incompetent                            or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon written notice of at least five days to the                            licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                 b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                            person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction imposed                            in accordance with Section                 .                                 c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                            suspension or revocation of his license.                                         A report authorized by Section                  may not contain any evidence of a conviction                            for speeding on an interstate system in this state if the conviction was for a speed of ten miles per                            hour or less, above the posted speed limit and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in                            writing by the individual whose report is being requested.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                            Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person if it has reason to                            believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is required under Title                              , Chapter   a, Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility, and has driven the motor vehicle or                            permitted it to be driven within this state without the security being in effect.                                 b  Section          a         regarding the requirement of proof of owner s or operator s security                            applies to persons whose driving privileges are suspended under this Subsection     .                                 c   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this                            subsection, the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.                                 d   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been                            revoked by the division under this subsection may file a request for agency action requesting a                            hearing.
