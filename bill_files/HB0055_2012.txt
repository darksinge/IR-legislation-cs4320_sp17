Section  
26-6-2

 is amended to read:
            
45

    
     26-6-2.  Definitions.
            
46

    
    As used in this chapter:
            
47

    
    (1)  "Ambulatory surgical center" is as defined in Section 

26-21-2

.
            
48

    
    [(1)] (2)  "Carrier" means an infected individual or animal who harbors a specific
            
49

    
infectious agent in the absence of discernible clinical disease and serves as a potential source of
            
50

    
infection for man.  The carrier state may occur in an individual with an infection that is
            
51

    
inapparent throughout its course, commonly known as healthy or asymptomatic carrier, or
            
52

    
during the incubation period, convalescence, and postconvalescence of an individual with a
            
53

    
clinically recognizable disease, commonly known as incubatory carrier or convalescent carrier. 
            
54

    
Under either circumstance the carrier state may be of short duration, as a temporary or transient
            
55

    
carrier, or long duration, as a chronic carrier.
            
56

    
    [(2)] (3)  "Communicable disease" means illness due to a specific infectious agent or its
            
57

    
toxic products which arises through transmission of that agent or its products from a reservoir
            
58

    
to a susceptible host, either directly, as from an infected individual or animal, or indirectly,

            
59


    
through an intermediate plant or animal host, vector, or the inanimate environment.
            
60

    
    [(3)] (4)  "Communicable period" means the time or times during which an infectious
            
61

    
agent may be transferred directly or indirectly from an infected individual to another individual,
            
62

    
from an infected animal to man, or from an infected man to an animal, including arthropods.
            
63

    
    [(4)] (5)  "Contact" means an individual or animal having had association with an
            
64

    
infected individual, animal, or contaminated environment so as to have had an opportunity to
            
65

    
acquire the infection.
            
66

    
    [(5)] (6)  "Epidemic" means the occurrence or outbreak in a community or region of
            
67

    
cases of an illness clearly in excess of normal expectancy and derived from a common or
            
68

    
propagated source.  The number of cases indicating an epidemic will vary according to the
            
69

    
infectious agent, size, and type of population exposed, previous experience or lack of exposure
            
70

    
to the disease, and time and place of occurrence.  Epidemicity is considered to be relative to
            
71

    
usual frequency of the disease in the same area, among the specified population, at the same
            
72

    
season of the year.
            
73

    
    (7)  "General acute hospital" is as defined in Section 

26-21-2

.
            
74

    
    [(6)] (8)  "Incubation period" means the time interval between exposure to an infectious
            
75

    
agent and appearance of the first sign or symptom of the disease in question.
            
76

    
    [(7)] (9)  "Infected individual" means an individual who harbors an infectious agent and
            
77

    
who has manifest disease or inapparent infection.  An infected individual is one from whom the
            
78

    
infectious agent can be naturally acquired.
            
79

    
    [(8)] (10)  "Infection" means the entry and development or multiplication of an
            
80

    
infectious agent in the body of man or animals.  Infection is not synonymous with infectious
            
81

    
disease; the result may be inapparent or manifest.  The presence of living infectious agents on
            
82

    
exterior surfaces of the body, or upon articles of apparel or soiled articles, is not infection, but
            
83

    
contamination of such surfaces and articles.
            
84

    
    [(9)] (11)  "Infectious agent" means an organism such as a virus, rickettsia, bacteria,
            
85

    
fungus, protozoan, or helminth that is capable of producing infection or infectious disease.
            
86

    
    [(10)] (12)  "Infectious disease" means a disease of man or animals resulting from an
            
87

    
infection.
            
88

    
    [(11)] (13)  "Isolation" means the separation, for the period of communicability, of
            
89

    
infected  individuals or animals from others, in such places and under such conditions as to

            
90


    
prevent the direct or indirect conveyance of the infectious agent from those infected to those
            
91

    
who are susceptible or who may spread the agent to others.
            
92

    
    [(12)] (14)  "Quarantine" means the restriction of the activities of well individuals or
            
93

    
animals who have been exposed to a communicable disease during its period of
            
94

    
communicability to prevent disease transmission.
            
95

    
    [(13)] (15)  "School" means a public, private, or parochial nursery school, licensed or
            
96

    
unlicensed day care center, child care facility, family care home, headstart program,
            
97

    
kindergarten, elementary, or secondary school through grade 12.
            
98

    
    [(14)] (16)  "Sexually transmitted disease" means those diseases transmitted through
            
99

    
sexual intercourse or any other sexual contact.

26-21-

 2.
            
101

    
    Section 2.
