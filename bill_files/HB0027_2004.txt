reduced by the amount of tax overpayment received by the court.
            
1140

    
    (c)  If the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice described in Subsection (3), or to
            
1141

    
resolve the warrant within 40 days after the notice was sent under that subsection, the
            
1142

    
overpayment applied as bail is forfeited and notice of the forfeiture shall be mailed to the
            
1143

    
taxpayer at the current address on file with the commission.  The court may then issue another

            
1144


    
warrant or allow the original warrant to remain in force if:
            
1145

    
    (i)  the taxpayer has not complied with an order of the court;
            
1146

    
    (ii)  the taxpayer has failed to appear and respond to a criminal charge for which a
            
1147

    
personal appearance is required; or
            
1148

    
    (iii)  the taxpayer has paid partial but not full bail in a case for which a personal
            
1149

    
appearance is not required.
            
1150

    
    (5)  If the alleged violations named in the warrant are later resolved in favor of the
            
1151

    
taxpayer, the bail amount shall be remitted to the taxpayer.
            
1152

    
    (6)  Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.
            
1153

    
    (7) (a)  If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld
            
1154

    
from wages exceeds the actual tax due, a refund or credit may not be made or allowed unless
            
1155

1156

    
refund or credit:
            
1157

    
    (i)  within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension
            
1158

    
of time for filing the return provided for in Subsection (7)(c); or
            
1159

    
    (ii)  within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever period is later.
            
1160

    
    (b) Except as provided in Subsection (7)(d), in other instances where a refund or credit
            
1161

    
of tax which has not been deducted and withheld from income is due, a credit or refund may
            
1162

    
not be allowed or made after three years from the time the tax was paid, unless, before the
            
1163

    
expiration of the period, a claim is filed by the taxpayer or his legal representative.
            
1164

    
    (c)  Beginning on July 1, 1998, the commission shall extend the period for a taxpayer to
            
1165

    
file a claim under Subsection (7)(a)(i) if:
            
1166

    
    (i)  the time period for filing a claim under Subsection (7)(a) has not expired; and
            
1167

    
    (ii)  the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement:

1172

    
    (i)  the three-year period under Subsection (7)(b) has not expired; and
            
1173

    
    (ii)  the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement:
            
1174

    
    (A)  authorizing the extension; and

            
1175


    
    (B)  providing for the length of the extension.
            
1176

    
    (8)  The fine and bail forfeiture provisions of this section apply to all warrants and fines
            
1177

    
issued in cases charging the taxpayer with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction described
            
1178

    
in this section which are outstanding on or after February 16, 1984.
            
1179

    
    (9)  If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the
            
1180

    
tax to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.
            
1181

    
    (10)  A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the
            
1182

    
application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years
            
1183

    
from the time the return was due for the taxable year of the loss.
            
1184

    
    (11)  If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and

1186

    
that the amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.
            
1187

    
    (12)  If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax,
            
1188

    
the amount is an overpayment.
            
1189

    
    (13)  If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable
            
1190

    
period of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.
            
1191

    
    (14) (a)  If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable
            
1192

    
income reported on [his] the taxpayer's federal income tax return that changes the taxpayer's
            
1193

    
fixed federal taxable income, or to report a change or correction which is treated in the same
            
1194

    
manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes, or to file an amended
            
1195

    
return with the commission, a claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax
            
1196

    
shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the date the notice of the change,
            
1197

    
correction, or amended return was required to be filed with the commission.
            
1198

    
    (b)  If the report or amended return is not filed within 90 days, interest on any resulting
            
1199

    
refund or credit ceases to accrue after the 90-day period.
            
1200

    
    (c)  The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in
            
1201

    
tax attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer's amended
            
1202

    
federal income tax return.
            
1203

    
    (d)  Except as specifically provided, this section does not affect the amount or the time
            
1204

    
within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
            
1205

    
    (15)  No credit or refund may be allowed or made if the overpayment is less than $1.

            
1206


    
    (16)  The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the tax paid during the three
            
1207

    
years immediately preceding the filing of the claim, or if no claim is filed, then during the three
            
1208

    
years immediately preceding the allowance of the credit or refund.
            
1209

    
    (17)  In the case of an overpayment of tax by the employer under the withholding
            
1210

    
provisions of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent
            
1211

    
that the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the
            
1212

    
provisions of this chapter.
            
1213

    
    (18)  If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under this chapter dies, the commission
            
1214

    
may make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer's estate.  If
            
1215

    
there is no executor or administrator, payment may be made to those persons who establish
            
1216

    
entitlement to inherit the property of the decedent in the proportions set out in Title 75, Utah
            
1217

    
Uniform Probate Code.

1219

    
Subsection 

59-10-536

and in the manner prescribed in Section 

59-1-402

.
            
1223

    
    Section 20.  
Section  
59-10-536

 is amended to read:
            
1224

    
     59-10-536.  Limitations on assessment and collection.
            
1225

    
    (1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amount of any tax imposed by this
            
1226

    
chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such
            
1227

    
return was filed on or after the date prescribed), and no proceeding in court without assessment
            
1228

    
for the collection of such tax shall be begun after the expiration of such period.
            
1229

    
    (2)  For purposes of this section:
            
1230

    
    (a)  A return of tax imposed by this chapter, except withholding tax, filed before the last
            
1231

    
day prescribed by statute or by rules promulgated pursuant to statute for the filing thereof, shall
            
1232

    
be deemed to be filed on such last day.
            
1233

    
    (b)  If a return of withholding tax for any period ending with or within a calendar year is
            
1234

    
filed before April 15 of the succeeding calendar year, such return shall be deemed to be filed on
            
1235

    
April 15 of such succeeding calendar year.
            
1236

    
    (3)  The tax may be assessed at any time if:

            
1237


    
    (a)  no return is filed;
            
1238

    
    (b)  a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax; or

    (c)  a return for the taxpayer is prepared by the commission in accordance with Section
            
1240

    

59-10-506

.
            
1241

    
    (4)  If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment of
            
1242

    
tax, both the commission and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after
            
1243

    
such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. 
            
1244

    
The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before
            
1245

    
the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
            
1246

    
    (5) (a)  If a change is made in a taxpayer's net income on his or her federal income tax
            
1247

    
return, either because the taxpayer has filed an amended return or because of an action by the
            
1248

    
federal government, the taxpayer must notify the commission within 90 days after the final
            
1249

    
determination of such change.  The taxpayer shall file a copy of the amended federal return and
            
1250

    
an amended state return which conforms to the changes on the federal return.  No notification
            
1251

    
is required of changes in the taxpayer's federal income tax return which do not affect state tax
            
1252

    
liability.
            
1253

    
    (b)  The commission may assess any deficiency in state income taxes within three years
            
1254

    
after such report or amended return was filed.  The amount of such assessment of tax shall not
            
1255

    
exceed the amount of the increase in Utah tax attributable to such federal change or correction. 
            
1256

    
The provisions of this Subsection (5)(b) do not affect the time within which or the amount for
            
1257

    
which an assessment may otherwise be made.  However, if the taxpayer fails to report to the
            
1258

    
commission the correction specified in this Subsection (5)(b) the assessment may be made at
            
1259

    
any time within six years after the date of said correction.
            
1260

    
    (6)  If a deficiency in federal income tax required to be reported is attributable to the
            
1261

    
application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback within the meaning of Section
            
1262

    
6501(h) of the Internal Revenue Code, the corresponding deficiency in the tax imposed by this
            
1263

    
chapter may be assessed at any time before the expiration of the period within which a
            
1264

    
deficiency for the taxable year of the net operating loss giving rise to the carryback may be
            
1265

    
assessed.
            
1266

    
    (7)  An erroneous refund shall be considered an underpayment of tax on the date made,
            
1267

    
and an assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time

            
1268


    
within three years from the time the refund was made, except that the assessment may be made
            
1269

    
within five years from the time the refund was made if it appears that any part of the refund
            
1270

    
was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.
            
1271

    
    (8)  If a return is required for a decedent or for his estate during the period of
            
1272

    
administration, the tax shall be assessed within 18 months after written request therefor (made
            
1273

    
after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator, or other person representing the estate
            
1274

    
of such decedent, but not more than three years after the time the return was filed, except as
            
1275

    
otherwise provided in Subsections (3) through (9).
            
1276

    
    (9)  The amount of any tax imposed by this chapter may be assessed at any time within
            
1277

    
six years after the time the return was filed if:
            
1278

    
    (a)  a resident individual, estate, or trust omits from fixed federal adjusted gross income
            
1279

    
[as reported for federal income tax purposes] an amount properly includable therein which is in
            
1280

    
excess of 25% of the amount of fixed federal adjusted gross income stated in the return; or
            
1281

    
    (b)  a nonresident individual, estate, or trust omits from fixed federal adjusted gross
            
1282

    
income as reported for federal income tax purposes an amount of fixed federal adjusted gross
            
1283

    
income derived from Utah sources as defined by Section 

59-10-117

, properly includable
            
1284

    
therein, which is in excess of 25% of the amount of fixed federal adjusted gross income
            
1285

    
derived from Utah sources which is reflected in such return.  For the purposes of this
            
1286

    
Subsection (9)(b) there may not be taken into account any amount which is omitted in the
            
1287

    
return if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a
            
1288

    
manner adequate to apprise the commission of the nature and amount of such item.
            
1289

    
    (10)  The running of the period of limitations on assessments or collection of tax or
            
1290

    
other amount [(]or of a transferee's liability[)] shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency,
            
1291

    
be suspended for the period during which the commission is prohibited from making the
            
1292

    
assessment or from collecting by levy.
            
1293

    
    Section 21.

     59-10-543.  Burden of proof.
            
1295

    
    In any proceeding before the commission under this chapter, the burden of proof shall
            
1296

    
be upon the petitioner except for the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be
            
1297

    
upon the commission:
            
1298

    
    (1)  whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax;

            
1299


    
    (2)  whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of a taxpayer, but not to
            
1300

    
show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax; and
            
1301

    
    (3)  whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency where such increase
            
1302

    
is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency was mailed and a petition under [Title 59,]
            
1303

    
Chapter 1, Part 5, Petitions for Redetermination of Deficiencies, is filed, unless such increase
            
1304

    
in deficiency is the result of a change or correction of fixed federal taxable income required to
            
1305

    
be reported, and of which change or correction the commission had no notice at the time it
            
1306

    
mailed the notice of deficiency.
