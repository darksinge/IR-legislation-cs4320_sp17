235

    
consensus standard, any adopted federal standard, or any adopted Utah standard, unless it
            
236

    
determines that issuance of the standard would not result in improved safety or health.
            
237

    
    (b)  All codes, standards, and rules adopted under Subsection (1)(a) shall take effect 30
            
238

    [(c)] (b)  The administrator, in issuing standards for toxic materials or harmful physical
            
260

    
agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent
            
261

    
feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material
            
262

    
impairment of health or functional capacity even if the employee has regular exposure to the
            
263

    
hazard during an employee's working life.  Development of standards under this subsection
            
264

    
shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and other information deemed
            
265

    
appropriate.  In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection
            
266

    
for the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field,
            
267

271

    
granting a variance from a standard issued under this section.  Temporary orders shall be

    (A)  files an application which meets the requirements of Subsection (2)[(d)](c)(iv);
            
274

    
    (B)  establishes that the employer is unable to comply with a standard by its effective
            
275

equipment needed for compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or
            
277

    
alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date;
            
278

    
    (C)  establishes that the employer is taking all available steps to safeguard the

the employer's program for compliance with the standard.  A temporary order may be granted
            
285

    
only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a public hearing; provided, that the
            
286

    
administrator may issue one interim order effective until a decision is made after public
            
287

    
hearing.
            
288

    
    (iii) A temporary order may not be in effect longer than the period reasonably required

comply with the standard or some part of the standard;
            
296

    
    (C)  a detailed statement of the reasons the employer is unable to comply;
            
297

    
    (D)  a statement of the measures taken and anticipated with specific dates, to protect
            
298

    
employees against the hazard;
            
299

    
    (E)  a statement of when the employer expects to comply with the standard and what
            
300

    
measures the employer has taken and those anticipated, giving specific dates for compliance;

and
            
302

    
    (F)  a certification that the employer has informed the employer's employees of the
            
303

    
application by:
            
304

    
    (I)  giving a copy to their authorized representative;
            
305

    
    (II)  posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a
            
306

    
copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted;
            
307

    
and
            
308

    
    (III)  by other appropriate means.
            
309

    
    (v)  The certification required under Subsection (2)[(d)](c)(iv) shall contain a

            
310


    
description of how employees have been informed.
            
311

    
    (vi)  The information to employees required under Subsection (2)[(d)](c)(v) shall
            
312

313

    
    (vii)  The administrator is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or some part
            
314

    
of the standard when the administrator determines that it is necessary to permit an employer to
            
315

    
participate in a research and development project approved by the administrator to demonstrate
            
316

    
or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.
            
317

    
    [(e)] (d) (i)  Any standard issued under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels
            
318

    
or other forms of warning necessary to ensure that employees are apprised of all hazards,
            
319

    
relevant symptoms and emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use
            
320

    
or exposure.  When appropriate, a standard shall prescribe suitable protective equipment and
            
321

    
control or technological procedures for use in connection with such hazards and provide for
            
322

    
monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in a manner
            
323

    
necessary for the protection of employees.  In addition, any such standard shall prescribe the
            
324

    
type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available by the
            
325

    
employer, or at the employer's cost, to employees exposed to hazards in order to most
            
326

    
effectively determine whether the health of employees is adversely affected by exposure.  If
            
327

    
medical examinations are in the nature of research as determined by the division, the
            
328

    
examinations may be furnished at division expense.  The results of such examinations or tests
            
329

    
shall be furnished only to the division; and, at the request of the employee, to the employee's
            
330

    
physician.
            
331

    
    (ii)  The administrator may by rule make appropriate modifications in requirements for
            
332

examinations warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments
            
334

    
acquired subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.
            
335

    
    [(f)] (e)  Whenever a rule issued by the administrator differs substantially from an
            
336

    
existing national consensus standard, the division shall publish a statement of the reasons why
            
337

    
the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national

            
338


    
consensus standard.
            
339

    
    [(g)] (f)  Whenever a rule, standard, or national consensus standard is modified by the
            
340

    
secretary so as to make less restrictive the federal Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and
            
341

    
Health Act of 1970, the less restrictive modification shall be immediately applicable to this
            
342

    
chapter and shall be immediately implemented by the division.
            
343

    
    (3) (a)  The administrator shall provide an emergency temporary standard to take
            
344

    
immediate effect upon publication if the administrator determines that:
            
345

    
    (i)  employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents
            
346

    
determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards; and
            
347

    
    (ii)  that the standard is necessary to protect employees from danger.
            
348

    
    (b)  An emergency standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard issued in
            
349

    
accordance with the procedures prescribed in Subsection (3)(c).
            
350

    
    (c)  Upon publication of an emergency standard the division shall commence a
            
351

    
proceeding in accordance with Subsection (2) and the standard as published shall serve as a
            
352

    
proposed rule for the proceedings.  The division shall issue a standard under Subsection (3) no
            
353

    
later than 120 days after publication of the emergency standard.
            
354

    
    (4) (a)  Any affected employer may apply to the division for a rule or order for a
            
355

    
variance from a standard issued under this section.  Affected employees shall be given notice of
            
356

    
each application and may participate in a hearing.  The administrator shall issue a rule or order
            
357

    
if the administrator determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where
            
358

    
appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a
            
359

    
preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or
            
360

    
processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and a
            
361

    
workplace to the employer's employees that are as safe and healthful as those which would
            
362

    
prevail if the employer complied with the standard.
            
363

    
    (b)  The rule or order issued under Subsection (4)(a) shall prescribe the conditions the
            
364

    
employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations and processes that the
            
365

    
employer must adopt and use to the extent they differ from the standard in question.

            
366


    
    (c)  A rule or order issued under Subsection (4)(a) may be modified or revoked upon
            
367

    
application by an employer, employees, or by the administrator on its own motion, in the
            
368

    
manner prescribed for its issuance under Subsection (4) at any time after six months from its
            
369

    
issuance.
            
370

    
    (5)  The administrator shall include a statement of reasons for the administrator's
            
371

    
actions when the administrator:
            
372

    
    (a)  issues any code, standard, rule, or order;
            
373

    
    (b)  grants any exemption or extension of time; or
            
374

    
    (c)  compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this chapter.
            
375

    
    (6)  Any person adversely affected by a standard issued under this section, at any time
            
376

    
prior to 60 days after a standard is issued, may file a petition challenging its validity with the
            
377

    
district court having jurisdiction for judicial review.  A copy of the petition shall be served
            
378

    
upon the division by the petitioner.  The filing of a petition may not, unless otherwise ordered
            
379

    
by the court, operate as a stay of the standard.  The determinations of the division shall be
            
380

    
conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.
            
381

    
    (7)  In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the division
            
382

    
shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for
            
383

    
particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments. 
            
384

    
The administrator shall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Department of
            
385

    
Health about the need for mandatory standards in determining the priority for establishing the
            
386

    
standards.
