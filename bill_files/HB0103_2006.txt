controlled substances under this section:
            
110

    
    (i)  an agent or employee, except a sales representative, of any registered manufacturer,
            
111

    
distributor, or dispenser of any controlled substance, if the agent or employee is acting in the
            
112

    
usual course of his business or employment; however, nothing in this subsection shall be
            
113

    
interpreted to permit an agent, employee, sales representative, or detail man to maintain an
            
114

    
inventory of controlled substances separate from the location of his employer's registered and
            
115

126

    
with, or performs laboratory analysis upon controlled substances.
            
127

license is inconsistent with the public interest.  The division shall not issue a license to any
            
133

    
person to prescribe, dispense, or administer a Schedule I controlled substance.  In determining

143

    
    (vi)  complied with any other factors that the division establishes that promote the
            
144

    
public health and safety.
            
145

    
    (b)  Licenses granted under Subsection (3)(a) do not entitle a licensee to manufacture,

1424

1430

    
the person serving the summons take the minor into custody at once.

1444

    
    (11)  Service of summons in the state shall be made personally, by delivering a copy to
            
1445

    
the person summoned; provided, however, that parents of a minor living together at their usual

reasonable time after issuance of the summons, he may order service by registered mail, with a

    (a)  If the address of the parent or guardian is known, due notice is given by sending

addressee only, or by personal service outside the state, as provided in the Utah Rules of Civil
            
1461

    
Procedure.  Service by registered mail shall be complete upon return to the court of the signed
            
1462

    
receipt.
            
1463

    
    (b)  If the address or whereabouts of the parent or guardian outside the state cannot after

diligent inquiry be ascertained, due notice is given by publishing a summons in a newspaper

1470

    
the person served was served personally within the state.
            
1471

    
    (14)  In the case of service in the state, service completed not less than 48 hours before
            
1472

    
the time set in the summons for the appearance of the person served, shall be sufficient to
            
1473

    
confer jurisdiction.  In the case of service outside the state, service completed not less than five
            
1474

    
days before the time set in the summons for appearance of the person served, shall be sufficient

environment that poses a threat to the [minor's] child's health or safety; or
            
2179

    
    (ii)  a parent's or guardian's action in leaving a [minor] child unattended would

failed to protect the [minor] child, after having received the notice, by allowing the [minor]

2270

    
guardians cannot be located.
            
2271

    
    (4)  The following persons shall be present at the shelter hearing:

2284

    
    (b)  The court may consider all relevant evidence, in accordance with the Utah Rules of
            
2285

    
Juvenile Procedure.  The court shall hear relevant evidence presented by the [minor] child,
            
2286

    
[his] the child's parent or guardian, the requesting party, or their counsel, but may in its
            
2287

    
discretion limit testimony and evidence to only that which goes to the issues of removal and the
            
2288

    
child's need for continued protection.
            
2289

    
    (6)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to
            
2290

    
the court:

    (a)  the reasons why the [minor] child was removed from the parent's or guardian's
            
2292

    
custody;
            
2293

    
    (b)  any services provided to the child and [his] the child's family in an effort to prevent

    (c)  the need, if any, for continued shelter;
            
2296

    
    (d)  the available services that could facilitate the return of the [minor] child to the

custody of [his] the child's parent or guardian; and
            
2298

    
    (e)  whether the child has any relatives who may be able and willing to take temporary
            
2299

    
custody.
            
2300

    
    (7)  The court shall consider all relevant evidence provided by persons or entities
            
2301

    
authorized to present relevant evidence pursuant to this section.
            
2302

    
    (8)  If necessary to protect the child, preserve the rights of a party, or for other good
            
2303

    
cause shown, the court may grant no more than one time-limited continuance, not to exceed
            
2304

    
five judicial days.
            
2305

    
    (9)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order that the
            
2306

    
[minor] child be released from the protective custody of the division unless it finds, by a
            
2307

    
preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist:
            
2308

    
    (a)  there is a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the [minor] child and
            
2309

    
the [minor's] child's physical health or safety may not be protected without removing [him] the
            
2310

    
child from [his parent's] the custody of the child's parent.  If a [minor] child has previously
            
2311

    
been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent incident of abuse,
            
2312

    
neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot
            
2313

    
safely remain in the custody of [his] the child's parent;
            
2314

    
    (b)  the [minor] child is suffering emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but is not
            
2315

    
limited to, extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward
            
2316

    
self or others, and there are no reasonable means available by which the [minor's] child's
            
2317

    
emotional health may be protected without removing the [minor] child from the custody of
            
2318

    
[his] the child's parent;
            
2319

    
    (c)  the [minor] child or another [minor] child residing in the same household has been
            
2320

    
physically or sexually abused, or is considered to be at substantial risk of being physically or
            
2321

    
sexually abused, by a parent, a member of the parent's household, or other person known to the

            
2322


    
parent.  If a parent has received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known
            
2323

    
to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in
            
2324

    
the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the
            
2325

    
child is at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused;
            
2326

    
    (d)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;
            
2327

    
    (e)  the [minor] child has been left without any provision for [his] the child's support;
            
2328

    
    (f)  a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for
            
2329

    
safe and appropriate care for the [minor] child;
            
2330

    
    (g)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the [minor has been] child is left by
            
2331

    
the parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the [minor] child, the
            
2332

    
whereabouts of the parent are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate [him] the parent have
            
2333

    
been unsuccessful;
            
2334

    
    (h)  the [minor] child is in immediate need of medical care;
            
2335

    
    (i)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to
            
2336

    
the child's health or safety;
            
2337

    
    (j)  the [minor] child or [another] a minor residing in the same household has been
            
2338

    
neglected;
            
2339

    
    (k)  the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been
            
2340

    
charged or arrested pursuant to Title 58, Chapter 37d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any
            
2341

    
clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section 

58-37d-3

, was located in the residence
            
2342

    
or on the property where the child resided; or
            
2343

    
    (l)  the child's welfare is otherwise endangered.
            
2344

    
    (10) (a)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether
            
2345

    
reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the [minor] child
            
2346

    
from [his] the child's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the
            
2347

    
need for continued removal.  If the court finds that the [minor] child can be safely returned to
            
2348

    
the custody of [his] the child's parent or guardian through the provision of those services, it
            
2349

    
shall place the [minor] child with [his] the child's parent or guardian and order that those
            
2350

    
services be provided by the division.
            
2351

    
    (b)  In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child's
            
2352

    
health,  safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.

            
2353


    
    (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency
            
2354

    
situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that
            
2355

    
any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
2356

    
    (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
2357

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
2358

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in [his] the child's home, return a
            
2359

    
child to [his] the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the
            
2360

    
offending parent or parents.
            
2361

    
    (13)  The court may not order continued removal of a [minor] child solely on the basis
            
2362

    
of educational neglect as described in Subsection 

78-3a-103

(1)[(s)](t)(ii).
            
2363

    
    (14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a [minor] child under this
            
2364

    
section, it shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
2365

    
    (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the [minor] child is returned home, the court
            
2366

    
shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
2367

    
    (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for
            
2368

    
the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if [he] the child were returned
            
2369

    
home, it shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the
            
2370

    
child, or the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural
            
2371

    
requirement of this chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.

unless it finds that the placement would be unsafe or otherwise detrimental to the child.  The
            
2382

    
provisions of this Subsection (1) are limited by the provisions of Subsection (8)(b).
            
2383

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section

2385

    
biological father who was married to the child's biological mother at the time the child was

78-30-4.14

 prior
            
2387

    
to removal of the child or voluntary surrender of the child by the custodial parent.  This
            
2388

    
definition applies regardless of whether the child has been or will be placed with adoptive
            
2389

    
parents or whether adoption has been or will be considered as a long term goal for the child.
            
2390

    
    (c) (i)  The court shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that parent to

 and 

62A-4a-202.4

, and
            
2394

    
check the division's management information system for any previous reports of abuse or
            
2395

    
neglect received by the division regarding the parent at issue.
            
2396

    
    (iii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any
            
2397

    
further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.
            
2398

    
    (iv)  The division shall report its findings in writing to the court.
            
2399

    
    (v)  The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending its
            
2400

    
determination regarding that placement.
            
2401

    
    (2)  If the court orders placement with a parent under Subsection (1), the child and the
            
2402

    
parent are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may order that the parent
            
2403

    
assume custody subject to the supervision of the court, and order that services be provided to
            
2404

    
the parent from whose custody the child was removed, the parent who has assumed custody, or
            
2405

    
both.  The court shall also provide for reasonable parent-time with the parent from whose
            
2406

    
custody the child was removed, unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the child.  The
            
2407

    
court's order shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether:
            
2408

    
    (a)  placement with the parent continues to be in the child's best interest;
            
2409

    
    (b)  the child should be returned to the original custodial parent;
            
2410

    
    (c)  the child should be placed with a relative, pursuant to Subsection (5); or
            
2411

    
    (d)  the child should be placed in the custody of the division.
            
2412

    
    (3)  The time limitations described in Section 

78-3a-311

 with regard to reunification
            
2413

    
efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with
            
2414

    
Subsection (1).

            
2415


    
    (4)  Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection (1)
            
2416

    
or (2).  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition
            
2417

    
that court for modification of the order.
            
2418

    
    (5) (a) (i)  If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of
            
2419

    
[his] the child's parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at
            
2420

    
that time, determine whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child.
            
2421

    
    (ii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a
            
2422

    
reasonable search to determine whether there are relatives of the child who are willing and
            
2423

    
appropriate, in accordance with the requirements of this part and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Part 2,
            
2424

    
Child Welfare Services, for placement of the child.  The court shall order the parents to
            
2425

    
cooperate with the division, within five working days, to provide information regarding
            
2426

    
relatives who may be able and willing to care for the child.
            
2427

    
    (iii)  The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the division pending the
            
2428

    
determination under Subsection (5)(a)(ii).
            
2429

    
    (iv)  This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an identified relative will
            
2430

    
receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration shall be given to a relative's
            
2431

    
request for placement of the child, if it is in the best interest of the child, and the provisions of
            
2432

    
this section are satisfied.
            
2433

    
    (b) (i)  If a willing relative is identified pursuant to Subsection (5)(a), the court shall
            
2434

    
make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative to assume custody, and the safety
            
2435

    
and appropriateness of placement with that relative.  In order to be considered a "willing
            
2436

    
relative" under this section, the relative shall be willing to cooperate if the child's permanency
            
2437

    
goal is reunification with his parent or parents, and be willing to adopt or take permanent
            
2438

    
custody of the child if that is determined to be in the best interest of the child.
            
2439

    
    (ii)  The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to conduct criminal background
            
2440

2441

    
the division's management information system for any previous reports of abuse or neglect
            
2442

    
regarding the relative at issue, report its findings in writing to the court, and provide sufficient
            
2443

    
information so that the court may determine whether:
            
2444

    
    (A)  the relative has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other children
            
2445

    
that may indicate or present a danger to this child;

            
2446


    
    (B)  the child is comfortable with the relative;
            
2447

    
    (C)  the relative recognizes the parent's history of abuse and is determined to protect the
            
2448

    
child;
            
2449

    
    (D)  the relative is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent for
            
2450

    
access to the child, in accordance with court orders;
            
2451

    
    (E)  the relative is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary; and
            
2452

    
    (F)  the relative can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.
            
2453

    
    (iii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any
            
2454

    
further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.
            
2455

    
    (iv)  The division shall complete and file its assessment regarding placement with a
            
2456

    
relative as soon as practicable, in an effort to facilitate placement of the child with a relative.
            
2457

    
    (c)  The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the
            
2458

    
division's investigation pursuant to Subsection (5)(b), and the court's determination regarding
            
2459

    
that placement.  The court shall ultimately base its determination regarding placement with a
            
2460

    
relative on the best interest of the child.
            
2461

    
    (d)  For purposes of this section, "relative" means an adult who is a grandparent, great

grandparent, aunt, great aunt, uncle, great uncle, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepparent, first
            
2463

2464

    
the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. Section 1903, "relative" also means an "extended
            
2465

    
family member" as defined by that statute.
            
2466

    
    (6) (a)  When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative pursuant to
            
2467

    
Subsection (5), it shall order that the relative assume custody subject to the continuing
            
2468

    
supervision of the court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided to the [minor]
            
2469

    
child and the relative.  That child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the
            
2470

    
Division of Child and Family Services.  The child and any relative with whom the child is
            
2471

    
placed are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may enter any order that it
            
2472

    
considers necessary for the protection and best interest of the child.  The court shall provide for
            
2473

    
reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the child was removed
            
2474

    
unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the child.
            
2475

    
    (b) (i)  Placement with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5) shall be periodically
            
2476

    
reviewed by the court, no less often than every six months, to determine whether:

            
2477


    
    (A)  placement with the relative continues to be in the child's best interest;
            
2478

    
    (B)  the child should be returned home; or
            
2479

    
    (C)  the child should be placed in the custody of the division.
            
2480

    
    (ii)  No later than 12 months after placement with a relative the court shall schedule a
            
2481

    
hearing for the purpose of entering a permanent order in accordance with the best interest of the
            
2482

    
child.
            
2483

    
    (iii)  The time limitations described in Section 

78-3a-311

, with regard to reunification
            
2484

    
efforts, apply to children placed with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5).
            
2485

    
    (7)  When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of [his] the child's
            
2486

    
parent and does not vest custody in another parent or relative under this section, the court shall
            
2487

    
order that the child be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family
            
2488

    
Services, to proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services
            
2489

    
in accordance with this chapter and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
2490

    
    (8) (a)  Any preferential consideration that a relative is initially granted pursuant to
            
2491

    
Subsection (5) expires 120 days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that time period has
            
2492

    
expired, a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a child, may not be
            
2493

    
granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.
            
2494

    
    (b)  When the time period described in Subsection (8)(a) has expired, the preferential
            
2495

    
consideration which is initially granted to a natural parent in accordance with Subsection (1), is
            
2496

    
limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best interest of the
            
2497

    
child.
            
2498

and that the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:
            
2534

    
    (A)  establish a primary permanency goal for the minor; and

2540

    
reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the [minor] child was
            
2541

    (B)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event
            
2571

    
that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.
            
2572

    
    (C)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a [minor's]
            
2573

    
child's primary permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance
            
2574

    (I)  30 days from the day on which the court makes the determination described in this
            
2576

    
Subsection (2)(c)(iii)(C); or
            
2577

    
    (II)  12 months from the day on which the [minor] child was first removed from the
            
2578

    
[minor's] child's home.
            
2579

    
    (d) (i) (A)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall
            
2580

    
order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the [minor] child and the
            
2581

    
[minor's] child's parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified
            
2582

    
period of time.
            
2583

    
    (B)  In providing the services described in Subsection (2)(d)(i)(A), the [minor's] child's
            
2584

    
health, safety, and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so
            
2585

    
order.
            
2586

    
    (ii)  The court shall:
            
2587

    
    (A)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child
            
2588

    
and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;
            
2589

    
    (B)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family
            
2590

2593

    
efforts, in accordance with state and federal law.
            
2594

    
    (iii) (A)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the
            
2595

    
date that the [minor] child was initially removed from the [minor's] child's home.
            
2596

    
    (B)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12

    (iv)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at any

    (v)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a [minor] child is

            
2601


    
determined to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established
            
2602

    
pursuant to Subsection 

78-3a-312

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:
            
2603

    
    (A)  place the [minor] child in accordance with the permanency plan; and
            
2604

    
    (B)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the
            
2605

    
[minor] child.
            
2606

    
    (e)  Any physical custody of the [minor] child by the parent or a relative during the
            
2607

    
period described in Subsection (2)(d) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
2608

    
    (f) (i)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted by
            
2609

    
the court in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

2610

    
reunification services.
            
2611

    
    (ii)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original
            
2612

    
removal of the [minor] child.
            
2613

    
    (iii)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
2614

    
within 30 days, in accordance with Section

.
            
2615

    
    (g)  With regard to a [minor] child who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the
            
2616

    
[minor] child is initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
2617

    
    (i)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
2618

    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-312

; and
            
2619

    
    (ii)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
2620

    
removal of the [minor] child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial
            
2621

    
efforts to comply with the child and family plan.
            
2622

    
    (h)  With regard to a [minor] child in the custody of the division whose parent or
            
2623

    
parents are ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that [minor] child
            
2624

    
for a period of six months from the date that reunification services were ordered:
            
2625

    
    (i)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and
            
2626

    
    (ii)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.
            
2627

    
    (3) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
2628

    
permanency for [minors] children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature
            
2629

    
finds that a parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.
            
2630

    
    (b)  The court may determine that:
            
2631

    
    (i)  efforts to reunify a [minor] child with the [minor's] child's family are not reasonable

            
2632


    
or appropriate, based on the individual circumstances; and
            
2633

    
    (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.
            
2634

    
    (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a [minor] child, and
            
2635

    
in making "reasonable efforts," the [minor's] child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the
            
2636

    
paramount concern.
            
2637

    
    (d) (i)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
2638

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
2639

    
circumstances exist:
            
2640

    
    (A)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
2641

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
2642

    
    (B)  subject to Subsection (3)(d)(ii), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such
            
2643

    
magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;
            
2644

    
    (C)  the [minor] child was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or
            
2645

    
sexual abuse, and following the adjudication the [minor] child:
            
2646

    
    (I)  was removed from the custody of the [minor's] child's parent;
            
2647

    
    (II)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and
            
2648

    
    (III)  is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse;
            
2649

    
    (D)  the parent:
            
2650

    
    (I)  caused the death of another [minor] child through abuse or neglect; or
            
2651

    
    (II)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:
            
2652

    
    (Aa)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or
            
2653

    
    (Bb)  child abuse homicide;
            
2654

    
    (E)  the [minor] child suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by
            
2655

    
the parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
2656

    
[minor] child;
            
2657

    
    (F)  the [minor] child is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the
            
2658

    
parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the [minor] child to pursue reunification
            
2659

    
services with the offending parent;
            
2660

    
    (G)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other [minor] child;
            
2661

    
    (H)  the [minor] child is removed from the [minor's] child's home on at least two
            
2662

    
previous occasions and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those

            
2663


    
times;
            
2664

    
    (I)  the parent has abandoned the [minor] child for a period of six months or longer; or
            
2665

    
    (J)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
2666

    
efforts or services.
            
2667

    
    (ii)  The finding under Subsection (3)(d)(i)(B) shall be based on competent evidence
            
2668

    
from mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision of services, the
            
2669

    
parent is not likely to be capable of adequately caring for the [minor] child within 12 months
            
2670

    
from the day on which the court finding is made.
            
2671

    
    (4)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take
            
2672

    
into consideration:
            
2673

    
    (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child
            
2674

    
and family plan;
            
2675

    
    (b)  the fact that the [minor] child was abused while the parent was under the influence
            
2676

    
of drugs or alcohol;
            
2677

    
    (c)  any history of violent behavior;
            
2678

    
    (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the [minor] child;
            
2679

    
    (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the [minor] child to repeated
            
2680

    
abuse;
            
2681

    
    (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
2682

    
successful; and
            
2683

    
    (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the [minor] child.
            
2684

    
    (5) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), and the
            
2685

    
whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the
            
2686

    
[minor] child, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.
            
2687

    
    (b)  The time limits described in Subsection (2) are not tolled by the parent's absence.
            
2688

    
    (6) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
2689

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the [minor] child. 
            
2690

    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (6)(a), the court shall
            
2691

    
consider:
            
2692

    
    (i)  the age of the [minor] child;
            
2693

    
    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;

            
2694


    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence;
            
2695

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment;
            
2696

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;
            
2697

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the [minor] child if services are not offered;
            
2698

    
    (vii)  for a [minor] child ten years of age or older, the [minor's] child's attitude toward
            
2699

    
the implementation of family reunification services; and
            
2700

    
    (viii)  any other appropriate factors.
            
2701

    
    (c)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the 12-month
            
2702

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2).
            
2703

    
    (d)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the 12-month
            
2704

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2), unless the court determines that continued reunification
            
2705

    
services would be in the [minor's] child's best interest.
            
2706

    
    (7)  If, pursuant to Subsections (3)(d)(i)(B) through (J), the court does not order
            
2707

    
reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30 days, in accordance
            
2708

    
with Section

 with child and family plan requirements.
            
2713

    
    If reunification efforts have been ordered by the court, a hearing shall be held no more
            
2714

    
than six months after initial removal of a [minor] child from the [minor's] child's home, in
            
2715

    
order for the court to determine whether:
            
2716

    
    (1)  the division has provided and is providing "reasonable efforts" to reunify a family,
            
2717

    
in accordance with the child and family plan established under Section 

62A-4a-205

    Section 36.  
Section  
78-3a-312

    (1) (a)  When reunification services have been ordered in accordance with Section
            
2724

    

78-3a-311

, with regard to a [minor] child who is in the custody of the Division of Child and

            
2725


    
Family Services, a permanency hearing shall be held by the court no later than 12 months after
            
2726

    
the original removal of [the minor] that child.
            
2727

    
    (b)  If reunification services were not ordered at the dispositional hearing, a permanency
            
2728

    
hearing shall be held within 30 days from the date of the dispositional hearing.
            
2729

    
    (2) (a)  If reunification services were ordered by the court in accordance with Section
            
2730

    

78-3a-311

2732

    
parent.
            
2733

    
    (b)  If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that return of the [minor]
            
2734

    
child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the [minor's] child's physical or emotional
            
2735

    
well-being, the [minor] child may not be returned to the custody of the [minor's] child's parent. 
            
2736

    
    (c)  Prima facie evidence that return of the [minor] child to a parent or guardian would
            
2737

    
create a substantial risk of detriment to the [minor] child is established if the parent or guardian
            
2738

    
fails to:
            
2739

    
    (i)  participate in a court approved child and family plan;
            
2740

    
    (ii)  comply with a court approved child and family plan in whole or in part; or
            
2741

    
    (iii)  meet the goals of a court approved child and family plan.
            
2742

    
    (3)  In making a determination under Subsection (2)(a), the court shall review and
            
2743

    
consider:
            
2744

    
    (a)  the report prepared by the Division of Child and Family Services;
            
2745

    
    (b)  any admissible evidence offered by the [minor's] child's guardian ad litem;
            
2746

    
    (c)  any report prepared by a foster care citizen review board pursuant to Section
            
2747

    

78-3g-103

;
            
2748

    
    (d)  any evidence regarding the efforts or progress demonstrated by the parent; and
            
2749

    
    (e)  the extent to which the parent cooperated and availed himself of the services
            
2750

    
provided.
            
2751

    
    (4) (a)  With regard to a case where reunification services were ordered by the court, if
            
2752

    
a [minor] child is not returned to the [minor's] child's parent or guardian at the permanency
            
2753

    
hearing, the court shall:
            
2754

    
    (i)  order termination of reunification services to the parent;
            
2755

    
    (ii)  make a final determination regarding whether termination of parental rights,

            
2756


    
adoption, or permanent custody and guardianship is the most appropriate final plan for the
            
2757

    
[minor] child, taking into account the [minor's] child's primary permanency goal established by
            
2758

    
the court pursuant to Section 

78-3a-311

; and
            
2759

    
    (iii)  establish a concurrent plan that identifies the second most appropriate final plan
            
2760

    
for the [minor] child.
            
2761

    
    (b)  If the Division of Child and Family Services documents to the court that there is a
            
2762

    
compelling reason that adoption, reunification, guardianship, and kinship placement are not in
            
2763

    
the [minor's] child's best interest, the court may order another planned permanent living
            
2764

    
arrangement, in accordance with federal law.
            
2765

    
    (c)  If the [minor] child clearly desires contact with the parent, the court shall take the
            
2766

    
[minor's] child's desire into consideration in determining the final plan. 
            
2767

    
    (d)  Consistent with Subsection (4)(e), the court may not extend reunification services
            
2768

    
beyond 12 months from the date the [minor] child was initially removed from the [minor's]
            
2769

    
child's home, in accordance with the provisions of Section

    (b)  When the court is informed by a peace officer or other person that a minor is or
            
2969

    
appears to be within the court's jurisdiction, the probation department shall make a preliminary
            
2970

    
inquiry to determine whether the interests of the public or of the minor require that further
            
2971

    
action be taken.
            
2972

    
    (c)  Based on the preliminary inquiry, the court may authorize the filing of or request

    (b)  an offense other than those listed in Subsection (1)(a) involving the use of a
            
3088

    
dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and the minor has been
            
3089

    
previously adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous weapon
            
3090

    
which also would have been a felony if committed by an adult.
            
3091

    
    (2)  All proceedings before the juvenile court related to charges filed under Subsection
            
3092

    (3) (a)  If the information alleges the violation of a felony listed in Subsection (1), the
            
3094

    
state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish
            
3095

    
probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection (1) has been committed
            
3096

    
and that the defendant committed it.  If proceeding under Subsection (1)(b), the state shall have

            
3097


    
the additional burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has
            
3098

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
3099

    
weapon.
            
3100

    
    (b)  If the juvenile court judge finds the state has met its burden under this Subsection
            
3101

    
(3), the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district
            
3102

    
court in the same manner as an adult unless the juvenile court judge finds that all of the
            
3103

    
following conditions exist:
            
3104

    
    (i)  the minor has not been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense involving
            
3105

    
the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult;
            
3106

    
    (ii)  that if the offense was committed with one or more other persons, the minor
            
3107

    
appears to have a lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants; and
            
3108

    
    (iii)  that the minor's role in the offense was not committed in a violent, aggressive, or
            
3109

    
premeditated manner.
            
3110

    
    (c)  Once the state has met its burden under this Subsection (3) as to a showing of
            
3111

    
probable cause, the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and presenting evidence
            
3112

    
as to the existence of the above conditions.
            
3113

    
    (d)  If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that all the above
            
3114

    
conditions are satisfied, the court shall so state in its findings and order the minor held for trial
            
3115

    
as a minor and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
3116

    
    (4)  If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the
            
3117

    
state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over
            
3118

    
under Subsection (1), the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor
            
3119

    
and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
3120

    
    (5)  At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue. 
            
3121

    
The defendant shall have the same right to bail as any other criminal defendant and shall be
            
3122

    
advised of that right by the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court shall set initial bail in
            
3123

    
accordance with Title 77, Chapter 20, Bail.
            
3124

    
    (6)  If an indictment is returned by a grand jury charging a violation under this section,
            
3125

    
the preliminary examination held by the juvenile court judge need not include a finding of
            
3126

    
probable cause that the crime alleged in the indictment was committed and that the defendant
            
3127

    
committed it, but the juvenile court shall proceed in accordance with this section regarding the

            
3128


    
additional considerations listed in Subsection (3)(b).
            
3129

    
    (7)  When a defendant is charged with multiple criminal offenses in the same
            
3130

    
information or indictment and is bound over to answer in the district court for one or more
            
3131

    
charges under this section, other offenses arising from the same criminal episode and any
            
3132

    
subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against him shall be considered together with
            
3133

    
those charges, and where the court finds probable cause to believe that those crimes have been
            
3134

    
committed and that the defendant committed them, the defendant shall also be bound over to
            
3135

    
the district court to answer for those charges.
            
3136

    
    (8)  A minor who is bound over to answer as an adult in the district court under this
            
3137

    
section or on whom an indictment has been returned by a grand jury, is not entitled to a
            
3138

    
preliminary examination in the district court.
            
3139

    
    (9)  Allegations contained in the indictment or information that the defendant has
            
3140

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
3141

    
weapon, or is 16 years of age or older, are not elements of the criminal offense and do not need
            
3142

    
to be proven at trial in the district court.
            
3143

    
    (10)  If a minor enters a plea to, or is found guilty of, any of the charges filed or any
            
3144

    
other offense arising from the same criminal episode, the district court retains jurisdiction over
            
3145

    
the minor for all purposes, including sentencing.
            
3146

    
    (11)  The juvenile court under Section 

78-3a-104

 and the Division of Juvenile Justice
            
3147

    
Services regain jurisdiction and any authority previously exercised over the [juvenile] minor

change of circumstances, if proved, would not affect the decree, it may dismiss the petition.  If
            
3161

    (b)  The cost of appointed counsel for an indigent minor or other indigent party,

3593


    
    (2)  If the state or county responsible to provide legal counsel for an indigent under
            
3594

    
Subsection (1)(b) has arranged by contract to provide services, the court if it has received
            
3595

    
notice or a copy of such contract shall appoint the contracting attorney as legal counsel to
            
3596

    
represent that indigent.
            
3597

    
    (3) In the absence of contrary contractual provisions regarding the selection and
            
3598

    
appointment of parental defense counsel, the court shall select and appoint the attorney or
            
3599

    
attorneys if:

3601

    
    (b)  the contract is with an additional attorney or attorneys in the event of a conflict of

has a copy or notice of such contract, before the court may make the appointment, it shall:
            
3606

    
    (a)  set the matter for a hearing;
            
3607

    
    (b)  give proper notice to the attorney general and the Office of Child Welfare Parental

3610

    
before it may make such appointment.
            
3611

    
    (5)  The indigent's mere preference for other counsel shall not be considered a
            
3612

    
compelling reason justifying the appointment of a noncontracting attorney.
            
3613

    
    (6)  The court may order a minor, parent, guardian, or custodian for whom counsel is
            
3614

    
appointed and the parents or guardian of any [minor] child for whom counsel is appointed to
            
3615

    
reimburse the county for the cost of appointed counsel.
