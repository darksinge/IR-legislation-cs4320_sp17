Section         is enacted to read            CHAPTER  .  SHOOTING ACTIVITIES RANGES                      .  Shooting range exception.                   As used in this chapter                a    Generally accepted operation practices  are those that are established by a nationally          recognized membership organization that                i   provides voluntary firearm safety programs  and               ii   actively promotes safe shooting through procedures developed with consideration of          reasonably available information regarding the safe operation of shooting activities ranges                b    Local government  means a county, city, or town                c    New shooting activities range  includes the resumption of shooting activities at the          range after a period of three years during which no shooting activity has occurred at the range                d    Person  means an individual, proprietorship, partnership, corporation, club, or other          legal entity  and              e    Shooting activities range  or  range  means an area designed and operated for the use         of rifles, shotguns, pistols, silhouettes, skeet, trap, black powder, archery, or any other similar         shooting.                  A local government may not enact an ordinance that requires a shooting activities         range to eliminate or limit shooting activities that have occurred on a regular basis at the range         prior to the enactment date of the ordinance.                  If a local government enacts or amends an ordinance relating to the operation of         shooting activities ranges, and if the operation of the shooting activities range conformed to the          law existing before the enactment or amendment of the ordinance, the range shall be permitted to          continue to operate even if the operation of the range does not conform to the new ordinance or          amendment.                   Any rule or regulation adopted by any state or local government that limit levels of          outdoor noise shall apply only to noise produced as a result of a substantial change in the use of          the shooting activities range and not to levels of noise existing at the time the rule or regulation          was enacted.                   Regardless of whether the operation of the shooting activities range complies with an          ordinance of a local government, a shooting activities range that exists as of May  ,     , and          operates in compliance with generally accepted operation practices may engage in all of the          following activities within its preexisting geographic boundaries                a   repair, remodel, or reinforce any conforming or nonconforming building or structure          as may be necessary in the interest of public safety or to secure the continued use of the building          or structure                b   reconstruct, repair, restore, or resume the use of a nonconforming building damaged          by fire, collapse, explosion, act of god, or act of war occurring after May  ,       or               c   do anything authorized under generally accepted operation practices, including                i   expanding or increasing its membership or opportunities for public participation  and               ii   expanding or increasing events and activities.                   a   The reconstruction, repair, or restoration in Subsection     shall be completed          within one year following the date of the damage or of the settlement of any property damage          claim, whichever is later.                      b   If reconstruction, repair, or restoration is not completed within the one year time period         prescribed by Subsection     a , the local government may, in its discretion, preclude the use of         the nonconforming building or structure.             Section  .  Section         is enacted to read                     .  Assumption of risk.             Each person who participates in shooting at a shooting activities range accepts the         associated risks to the extent the risks are obvious and inherent.  Those risks include injuries that         may result from noise, discharge of projectile or shot, malfunction of shooting equipment not         owned by the shooting range, natural variations in terrain, surface or subsurface snow or ice          conditions, bare spots, rocks, trees, and other forms of natural growth or debris.              Section  .  Section         is enacted to read                      .  When nuisance action permitted.                   Except as provided in Subsection    , a person who operates or uses a shooting          activities range in this state shall not be subject to civil liability or criminal prosecution for noise          or noise pollution resulting from the operation or use of the range if                a   the range was established, constructed, or operated prior to the implementation of any          noise ordinances, rules, or regulations  or               b   the range is in compliance with any noise control laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations          that applied to the range and its operation at the time of establishment, construction, or initial          operation of the range.                   A nuisance action for noise may be maintained against a shooting activities range only          by                a   a person who acquired property in the vicinity of a shooting activities range before the          date the range was established if the action is brought                i   within five years after the establishment of the range  or               ii   within three years after a substantial change in the use of the range  or               b   a person who acquired property in the vicinity of a shooting activities range after the          date the range was established for substantial change in the use of the range if the action is brought          within three years from the beginning of the substantial change.
