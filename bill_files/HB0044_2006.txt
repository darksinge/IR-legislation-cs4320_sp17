371

    
manner and with such details as may be provided by resolution; it being the express intention
            
372

    
of the legislature that interest rate limitations elsewhere appearing in the laws of Utah shall not
            
373

    
apply to nor limit the rate of interest on bonds issued under this chapter.  The resolution shall

fiscal agent to assist and advise it with respect to the bonds and the fiscal agent has received or
            
384

632

    
the local political subdivision, for the prompt and punctual payment of principal of and interest

any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and any suit, action or proceeding brought
            
649

    
by such person in interest shall be a preferred cause and shall be heard and disposed of without
