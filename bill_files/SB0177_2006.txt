    (b)  Extensions of time, not exceeding 50 years from the date of approval of the

34

    
proper showing of diligence or reasonable cause for delay.
            
35

    
    (c)  Additional extensions of time, beyond 50 years, may be granted by the state
            
36

water will be needed to meet the reasonable future requirements of the public.
            
38

    
    (d)  All requests for extension of time shall be made by signed statement and shall be
            
39

    
filed in the office of the state engineer on or before the date fixed for filing proof of
            
40

    
appropriation.
            
41

    
    (e)  Extensions not exceeding 14 years after the date of approval may be granted by the
            
42

    
state engineer upon a sufficient showing by signed statement, but extensions beyond 14 years
            
43

    
shall be granted only after application and publication of notice.
            
44

    
    (f) (i)  The state engineer shall publish a notice of the application once a week for two
            
45

    
successive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation, in the county in which the source of
            
46

    
the water supply is located and where the water is to be used.
            
47

    
    (ii)  The notice shall:
            
48

    
    (A)  state that an application has been made; and
            
49

    
    (B)  specify where the interested party may obtain additional information relating to the
            
50

    
application.
            
51

    
    (g)  Any person who owns a water right from the source of supply referred to in
            
52

53

    
state engineer:
            
54

    
    (i)  within 20 days after the notice is published, if the adjudicative proceeding is
            
55

    
informal; and
            
56

    
    (ii)  within 30 days after the notice is published, if the adjudicative proceeding is
            
57

    
formal.

            
58


    
    (h)  In considering an application to extend the time in which to place water to
            
59

    
beneficial use under an approved application, the state engineer shall deny the extension and
            
60

    
declare the application lapsed, unless the applicant affirmatively shows that the applicant has
            
61

    
exercised or is exercising reasonable and due diligence in working toward completion of the
            
62

    
appropriation.
            
63

    
    (i) (i)  If reasonable and due diligence is shown by the applicant, the state engineer shall
            
64

    
approve the extension.
            
65

    
    (ii)  The approved extension is effective so long as the applicant continues to exercise
            
66

    
reasonable diligence in completing the appropriation.
            
67

    
    (j)  The state engineer shall consider the holding of an approved application by any
            
68

    
public agency to meet the reasonable future requirements of the public to be reasonable and
            
69

    
due diligence within the meaning of this section for the first 50 years.  The state engineer may
            
70

    
approve extensions beyond 50 years for a public agency, if the agency provides information
            
71

    
sufficient to demonstrate the water will be needed to meet the reasonable future requirements
            
72

    
of the public.
            
73

    
    (k)  If the state engineer finds unjustified delay or lack of diligence in prosecuting the
            
74

    
works to completion, the state engineer may deny the extension or may grant the request in part
            
75

    
or upon conditions, including a reduction of the priority of all or part of the application.
            
76

    
    (3) (a)  Except as provided in Subsections (3)(b) and (c), an application upon which
            
77

    
proof has not been submitted shall lapse and have no further force or effect after the expiration
            
78

    
of 50 years from the date of its approval.
            
79

    
    (b)  If the works are constructed with which to make beneficial use of the water applied
            
80

    
for, the state engineer may, upon showing of that fact, grant additional time beyond the 50-year
            
81

    
period in which to make proof.
            
82

    
    (c)  An application held by a public agency to meet the reasonable future requirements
            
83

    
of the public, for which proof of appropriation has not been submitted, shall lapse, unless
            
84

    
extended as provided in Subsection (2)(j).
