In issuing an order under this section, the court may not modify the amount of the                           judgment of complete restitution.                                     Whether or not a default constitutes contempt, the court may add to the amount owed                           the fees established under Subsection       A              and postjudgment interest.                                     a   If a criminal judgment account receivable is past due in a felony case, the judge                           shall determine whether or not to record the unpaid balance of the account receivable as a civil                           judgment and transfer the responsibility for collecting the judgment to the Office of State Debt                           Collection.                                 b   If a criminal judgment account receivable in a nonfelony case is past due, the district                           court may, without a motion or hearing, record the unpaid balance of the criminal judgment                           account receivable as a civil judgment and transfer the responsibility for collecting the account                           receivable to the Office of State Debt Collection.                                 c   If a criminal judgment account receivable in a nonfelony case is more than    days past                           due, the district court shall, without a motion or hearing, record the unpaid balance of the criminal                           judgment account receivable as a civil judgment and transfer the responsibility for collecting the                           criminal judgment account receivable to the Office of State Debt Collection.                                           a   When a fine, forfeiture, surcharge, cost permitted by statute, fee, or an order                            of restitution is imposed on a corporation or unincorporated association, the person authorized to                            make disbursement from the assets of the corporation or association shall pay the  fine or make                              the restitution  obligation from those assets.   His failure                                  b   Failure to  do so  pay the obligation may be held to be contempt  unless he makes the                           showing required in  under Subsection    .                                      The term of imprisonment for contempt for nonpayment of fines or failure to make                           restitution shall be set forth in the commitment order.                                       If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the default in the payment of a fine or                           restitution is not contempt, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for                           payment, reducing the amount of the payment or of each installment, or revoking the fine or order                           of restitution or the unpaid portion in whole or in part.                                       a   A default in the payment of a fine or costs or failure to make restitution or any                           installment may be collected by any means authorized by law for the enforcement of a judgment.                                   b         The prosecuting attorney may collect restitution in behalf of a victim.                                  c   The levy of execution for the collection of a fine or restitution does not discharge a                           defendant committed to imprisonment for contempt until the amount of the fine or restitution has                           actually been collected.

    conditions of probation.                                 ii   Probation may not be revoked except upon a hearing in court and a finding that the                            conditions of probation have been violated.                                 b   i   Upon the filing of an affidavit alleging with particularity facts asserted to constitute                            violation of the conditions of probation, the court that authorized probation shall determine if the                            affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or extension of                            probation is justified.                                 ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the                            defendant a warrant for his arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show cause why his                            probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.                                 c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall be                            served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.                                 ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.                                 iii   The order to show cause shall inform the defendant of a right to be represented by                            counsel at the hearing and to have counsel appointed for him if he is indigent.                                 iv   The order shall also inform the defendant of a right to present evidence.                                 d   i   At the hearing, the defendant shall admit or deny the allegations of the affidavit.                                 ii   If the defendant denies the allegations of the affidavit, the prosecuting attorney shall                            present evidence on the allegations.                                 iii   The persons who have given adverse information on which the allegations are based                            shall be presented as witnesses subject to questioning by the defendant unless the court for good                            cause otherwise orders.                                 iv   The defendant may call witnesses, appear and speak in his own behalf, and present                            evidence.                                 e   i   After the hearing the court shall make findings of fact.                                    ii   Upon a finding that the defendant violated the conditions of probation, the court may                            order the probation revoked, modified, continued, or that the entire probation term commence                            anew.                                 iii   If probation is revoked, the defendant shall be sentenced or the sentence previously                            imposed shall be executed.
