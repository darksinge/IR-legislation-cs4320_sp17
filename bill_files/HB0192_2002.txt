Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM      Under the current provisions of the Volunteer Government Workers Act, volunteer firefighters  receive greater workers  compensation benefits than do other volunteers.  This bill extends the  differential treatment to volunteer auxiliary police officers.  Under equal protection principles of  the Constitution of the United States and the uniform operation of the laws provisions of the Utah  Constitution, there are limits on a legislature s ability to establish classifications and then treat  members of the classes differently.  In addition, because of the exclusive remedy element of  workers  compensation, the open courts provision of the Utah Constitution may be implicated if  the remedies provided under workers  compensation are found inadequate.  In examining the  permissibility of classes, courts look to factors such as the relationship between the class and the  legislative objective being pursued.
