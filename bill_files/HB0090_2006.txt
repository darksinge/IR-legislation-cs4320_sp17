 LONG TITLE
            
8

    
 General Description:
            
9

    
    This bill modifies the Criminal Code regarding crimes motivated by bias, by providing
            
10

    
that courts and the Board of Pardons and Parole consider if the offender's act against a
            
11

    
victim includes specified aggravating factors that pose harm to the community.
            
12

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
13

    
    This bill:
            
14

    
    .    repeals the current criminal provision that enhances penalties for certain crimes that
            
15

    
are committed to threaten or intimidate;
            
16

    
    .    defines "aggravating factor" as an offender's selection of a victim based on the
            
17

    
victim's membership or perceived membership in a group, and that this selection
            
18

    
results in public harm;
            
19

    
    .    provides that sentencing courts and the Board of Pardons and Parole shall consider
            
20

    
these aggravating factors; and
            
21

    
    .    provides that the courts and the Board of Pardons and Parole shall also consider if
            
22

    
the current law already increases the penalty for the offense if defendant selects a
            
23

    
member of a group, such as assault offenses against law enforcement officers or
            
24

    
school employees.

39

    
aggravating factor that the defendant, in committing the offense, selected the victim or property

primarily because the victim or the owner or holder of the property was actually or was

42
