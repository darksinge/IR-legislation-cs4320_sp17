324

    
state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish
            
325

    
probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection (1) has been committed
            
326

    
and that the defendant committed it.  If proceeding under Subsection (1)(b), the state shall have

weapon.

331

    
(3), the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district
            
332

333

    
following conditions exist:
            
334

    
    (i)  the minor has not been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense involving
            
335

    
the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult;

    (ii)  that if the offense was committed with one or more other persons, the minor
            
337

    
appears to have a lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants; and

            
338


    
    (iii)  that the minor's role in the offense was not committed in a violent, aggressive, or
            
339

    
premeditated manner.

    (c)  Once the state has met its burden under this Subsection (3) as to a showing of
            
341

    
probable cause, the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and presenting evidence
            
342

    
as to the existence of the above conditions.
            
343

    
    (d)  If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that all the above
            
344

    
conditions are satisfied, the court shall so state in its findings and order the minor held for trial
            
345

    
as a minor and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
346

    
    (4)  If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the
            
347

    
state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over
            
348

    
under Subsection (1), the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor
            
349

    
and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
350

    
    (5)  At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue. 
            
351

352

    
advised of that right by the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court shall set initial bail in

the preliminary examination held by the juvenile court judge need not include a finding of
            
356

    
probable cause that the crime alleged in the indictment was committed and that the defendant
            
357

    
committed it, but the juvenile court shall proceed in accordance with this section regarding the
            
358

    
additional considerations listed in Subsection (3)(b).
            
359

    
    (7)  When a defendant is charged with multiple criminal offenses in the same
            
360

    
information or indictment and is bound over to answer in the district court for one or more
            
361

    
charges under this section, other offenses arising from the same criminal episode and any
            
362

    
subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against him shall be considered together with
            
363

    
those charges, and where the court finds probable cause to believe that those crimes have been
            
364

    
committed and that the defendant committed them, the defendant shall also be bound over to
            
365

    
the district court to answer for those charges.
            
366

    
    (8)  A minor who is bound over to answer as an adult in the district court under this
            
367

    
section or on whom an indictment has been returned by a grand jury is not entitled to a
            
368

    
preliminary examination in the district court.

            
369


    
    (9)  Allegations contained in the indictment or information that the defendant has
            
370

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
371

    
weapon, or is 16 years of age or older, are not elements of the criminal offense and do not need
            
372

    
to be proven at trial in the district court.
            
373

    
    (10)  If a minor enters a plea to, or is found guilty of, any of the charges filed or any
            
374

    
other offense arising from the same criminal episode, the district court retains jurisdiction over
            
375

    
the minor for all purposes, including sentencing.
            
376

    
    (11)  The juvenile court under Section 

78A-6-103

 and the Division of Juvenile Justice
            
377

    
Services regain jurisdiction and any authority previously exercised over the minor when there
            
378

    
is an acquittal, a finding of not guilty, or dismissal of all charges in the district court.
