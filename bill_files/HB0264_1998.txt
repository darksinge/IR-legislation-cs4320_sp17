30    her own actions and is not excused from strict compliance with the provisions of this  chapter

31    based upon any action, statement, or omission of the other parent or third parties.

- 3 -


1        (2)  Any person injured by fraudulent representations or actions in connection with an

2    adoption is entitled to pursue civil or criminal penalties in accordance with existing law.  A

3    fraudulent representation is not a defense to strict compliance with the requirements of this

4    chapter, and is not a basis for dismissal of a petition for adoption, vacation of an adoption decree,

5    or an automatic grant of custody to the offended party.  Custody determinations shall be based on

6    the best interest of the child, in accordance with the provisions of Section 78-30-4.16.

7        (3)  The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or misrepresentation

8    in adoption proceedings, and has provided a method for absolute protection of an unmarried

9    biological father's rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  In balancing the rights

10    and interests of the state, and of all parties affected by fraud, specifically the child, the adoptive

11    parents, and the unmarried biological father, the Legislature has determined that the unmarried

12    biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate the effects of fraud and that,

13    therefore, the burden of fraud shall be borne by him.

14        (4)  The Legislature finds that an unmarried biological father who resides in another state

15    may not, in every circumstance, be reasonably presumed to know of, and strictly comply with, the

16    requirements of this chapter.  Therefore when all of the following requirements have been met, that

17    unmarried biological father may contest an adoption, prior to finalization of the decree of adoption,

18    and assert his interest in the child; the court may then, in its discretion, proceed with an evidentiary

19    hearing under Subsection 78-30-4.16(2):

20        (a)  the unmarried biological father resides and has resided in another state where the

21    unmarried mother was also located or resided;

22        (b)  the mother left that state without [notification or information to] notifying or informing

23    the unmarried biological father [regarding where] that she could be [contacted or] located in the

24    state of Utah;

25        (c)  the unmarried biological father has, through every reasonable means, attempted to

26    locate the mother but [has been unable to do so] does not know or have reason to know that the

27    mother is residing in the state of Utah; and

28        (d)  the unmarried biological father has complied with the most stringent and complete

29    requirements of the state where the mother previously resided or was located, in order to protect

30    and preserve his parental interest and right in the child in cases of adoption.
