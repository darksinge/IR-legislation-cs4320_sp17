    (f) (i)  Local political subdivisions with a population or serving a population of less

465

    
    (4)  A local political subdivision may only impose impact fees on development
            
466

    
activities  when its plan for financing system improvements establishes that impact fees are
            
467

    
necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the costs borne in the past and to be borne in the
            
468

    
future, in comparison to the benefits already received and yet to be received.
            
469

    
    (5) (a)  Each local political subdivision imposing impact fees shall prepare a written
            
470

    
analysis of each impact fee that:
            
471

    
    (i)  identifies the impact on system improvements required by the development activity;
            
472

    
    (ii)  demonstrates how those impacts on system improvements are reasonably related to
            
473

    
the development activity;
            
474

    
    (iii)  estimates the  proportionate share of the costs of impacts on system improvements 
            
475

    
that are reasonably related to the new development activity; and
            
476

    
    (iv)  based upon those factors and the requirements of this chapter, identifies how the
            
477

    
impact fee was calculated.

            
478


    
    (b)  In analyzing whether or not the proportionate share of the costs of public facilities
            
479

    
are reasonably related to the new development activity, the local political subdivision shall
            
480

    
identify, if applicable:
            
481

    
    (i)  the  cost of  existing public facilities;
            
482

    
    (ii)  the manner of financing existing public facilities, such as user charges, special
            
483

    
assessments, bonded indebtedness, general taxes, or federal grants;
            
484

    
    (iii)  the relative extent to which the newly developed properties and the other
            
485

    
properties in the municipality have already contributed to the cost of existing public facilities,
            
486

    
by such means as user charges, special assessments, or payment from the proceeds of general
            
487

    
taxes;
            
488

    
    (iv)  the relative extent to which the newly developed properties and the other
            
489

    
properties in the municipality will contribute to the cost of existing public facilities in the
            
490

    
future;
            
491

    
    (v)  the extent to which the newly developed properties are entitled to a credit because
            
492

    
the municipality is requiring their developers or owners, by contractual arrangement or
            
493

    
otherwise, to provide common facilities, inside or outside the proposed development, that have
            
494

    
been provided by the municipality and financed through general taxation or other means, apart
            
495

    
from user charges, in other parts of the municipality;
            
496

    
    (vi)  extraordinary costs, if any, in servicing the newly developed properties; and
            
497

    
    (vii)  the time-price differential inherent in fair comparisons of amounts paid at
            
498

    
different times.
            
499

    
    (c)  Each local political subdivision that prepares a written analysis under this
            
500

    
Subsection (5) on or after July 1, 2000 shall also prepare a summary of the written analysis,
            
501

    
designed to be understood by a lay person.
            
502

    
    (6)  Each local political subdivision that adopts an impact fee enactment under Section
            
503

    

11-36-202

 on or after July 1, 2000 shall, at least 14 days before adopting the enactment, submit
            
504

    
to each public library within the local political subdivision:
            
505

    
    (a)  a copy of the written analysis required by Subsection (5)(a); and

            
506


    
    (b)  a copy of the summary required by Subsection (5)(c).
            
507

    
    (7)  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to repeal or otherwise eliminate any
            
508

    
impact fee in effect on the effective date of this [act] chapter that is pledged as a source of
            
509

    
revenues to pay  bonded indebtedness that was incurred before the effective date of this [act]

.
            
517

commission in the impact fee enactment process.
            
546

    
    (2)  The  local political subdivision shall ensure that the impact fee enactment contains:
            
547

    (a)  exempts low income housing and other development activities with broad public
            
563

    
purposes from impact fees and establishes one or more sources of funds other than impact fees
            
564

previously constructed improvement; and

    (c)  allows a credit against impact fees for any dedication of land for, improvement to,

or new construction of, any system improvements provided by the developer if the facilities:
            
570

    
    (i)  are identified in the capital facilities plan; and
            
571

    
    (ii)  are required by the local political subdivision as a condition of approving the
            
572

    
development activity.
            
573

    
    (4)  Except as provided in Subsection (3)(b), the local political subdivision may not

impose an impact fee to cure deficiencies in public facilities serving existing development.
            
575

    
    (5)  Notwithstanding the requirements and prohibitions of this chapter, a local political
            
576

    
subdivision may impose and assess an impact fee for environmental mitigation when:
            
577

    
    (a)  the local political subdivision has formally agreed to fund a Habitat Conservation
            
578

    
Plan to resolve conflicts with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. Sec 1531, et seq.
            
579

    
or other state or federal environmental law or regulation;
            
580

    
    (b)  the impact fee bears a reasonable relationship to the environmental mitigation
            
581

    
required by the Habitat Conservation Plan; and

    (c)  the legislative body of the local political subdivision adopts an ordinance or
            
583

    
resolution:
            
584

    
    (i)  declaring that an impact fee is required to finance the Habitat Conservation Plan;

    (ii)  establishing periodic sunset dates for the impact fee; and
            
586

    
    (iii)  requiring the legislative body to:
            
587

    
    (A)  review the impact fee on those sunset dates;
            
588

589

    
Conservation Plan; and

            
590


    
    (C)  affirmatively reauthorize the impact fee if the legislative body finds that the impact
