Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
31

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
77-15-5

 is amended to read:
            
32

    
     77-15-5.  Order for hearing -- Stay of other proceedings -- Examinations of
            
33

    
 defendant -- Scope of examination and report.
            
34

    
    (1) (a)  When a petition is filed pursuant to Section 

77-15-3

 raising the issue of the
            
35

    
defendant's competency to stand trial or when the court raises the issue of the defendant's
            
36

    
competency pursuant to Section 

77-15-4

, the court in which proceedings are pending shall stay
            
37

    
all proceedings.  If the proceedings are in a court other than the district court in which the
            
38

    
petition is filed, the district court shall notify that court of the filing of the petition.
            
39

    
    (b)  The district court in which the petition is filed shall pass upon the sufficiency of the
            
40

    
allegations of incompetency.  If a petition is opposed by either party, the court shall, prior to
            
41

    
granting or denying the petition, hold a limited hearing solely for the purpose of determining
            
42

    
the sufficiency of the petition.  If the court finds that the allegations of incompetency raise a
            
43

    
bona fide doubt as to the defendant's competency to stand trial, it shall enter an order for a
            
44

    
hearing on the mental condition of the person who is the subject of the petition.
            
45

    
    (2) (a)  After the granting of a petition and prior to a full competency hearing, the court
            
46

    
may order the Department of Human Services to examine the person and to report to the court
            
47

    
concerning the defendant's mental condition.
            
48

    
    (b)  The defendant shall be examined by at least two mental health experts not involved
            
49

    
in the current treatment of the defendant.
            
50

    
    (c)  If the issue is sufficiently raised in the petition or if it becomes apparent that the
            
51

    
defendant may be incompetent due to mental retardation, at least one expert experienced in
            
52

    
mental retardation assessment shall evaluate the defendant.  Upon appointment of the experts,
            
53

    
the petitioner or other party as directed by the court shall provide information and materials to
            
54

    
the examiners relevant to a determination of the defendant's competency and shall provide
            
55

    
copies of the charging document, arrest or incident reports pertaining to the charged offense,
            
56

    
known criminal history information, and known prior mental health evaluations and treatments.
            
57

    
    (d)  The prosecuting and defense attorneys shall cooperate in providing the relevant
            
58

    
information and materials to the examiners, and the court may make the necessary orders to

            
59


    
provide the information listed in Subsection (2)(c) to the examiners.  The court may provide in
            
60

    
its order for a competency examination of a defendant that custodians of mental health records
            
61

    
pertaining to the defendant shall provide those records to the examiners without the need for
            
62

    
consent of the defendant or further order of the court.
            
63

    
    (3)  During the examination under Subsection (2), unless the court or the executive
            
64

    
director of the department directs otherwise, the defendant shall be retained in the same
            
65

    
custody or status he was in at the time the examination was ordered.
            
66

    
    (4)  The experts shall in the conduct of their examination and in their report to the court
            
67

    
consider and address, in addition to any other factors determined to be relevant by the experts:
            
68

    
    (a)  the defendant's present capacity to:
            
69

    
    (i)  comprehend and appreciate the charges or allegations against him;
            
70

    
    (ii)  disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind;
            
71

    
    (iii)  comprehend and appreciate the range and nature of possible penalties, if
            
72

    
applicable, that may be imposed in the proceedings against him;
            
73

    
    (iv)  engage in reasoned choice of legal strategies and options;
            
74

    
    (v)  understand the adversary nature of the proceedings against him;
            
75

    
    (vi)  manifest appropriate courtroom behavior; and
            
76

    
    (vii)  testify relevantly, if applicable;
            
77

    
    (b)  the impact of the mental disorder, or mental retardation, if any, on the nature and
            
78

    
quality of the defendant's relationship with counsel;
            
79

    
    (c)  if psychoactive medication is currently being administered:
            
80

    
    (i)  whether the medication is necessary to maintain the defendant's competency; and
            
81

    
    (ii)  the effect of the medication, if any, on the defendant's demeanor and affect and
            
82

    
ability to participate in the proceedings.
            
83

    
    (5)  If the expert's opinion is that the defendant is incompetent to proceed, the expert
            
84

    
shall indicate in the report:
            
85

    
    (a)  which of the above factors contributes to the defendant's incompetency;
            
86

    
    (b)  the nature of the defendant's mental disorder or mental retardation and its
            
87

    
relationship to the factors contributing to the defendant's incompetency;
            
88

    
    (c)  the treatment or treatments appropriate and available; and
            
89

    
    (d)  the defendant's capacity to give informed consent to treatment to restore

            
90


    
competency.
            
91

    
    (6)  The experts examining the defendant shall provide an initial report to the court and
            
92

    
the prosecuting and defense attorneys within 30 days of the receipt of the court's order.  The
            
93

    
report shall inform the court of the examiner's opinion concerning the competency of the
            
94

    
defendant to stand trial, or, in the alternative, the examiner may inform the court in writing that
            
95

    
additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the examiner informs the court that
            
96

    
additional time is needed, the examiner shall have up to an additional 30 days to provide the
            
97

    
report to the court and counsel.  The examiner must provide the report within 60 days from the
            
98

    
receipt of the court's order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional
            
99

    
period of time to complete the examination and provide the report.
            
100

    
    (7)  Any written report submitted by the experts shall:
            
101

    
    (a)  identify the specific matters referred for evaluation;
            
102

    
    (b)  describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination and the
            
103

    
purpose or purposes for each;
            
104

    
    (c)  state the expert's clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue referred
            
105

    
for examination by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the expert
            
106

    
could not give an opinion; and
            
107

    
    (d)  identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the basis for the
            
108

    
expert's clinical findings and opinions.
            
109

    
    (8) (a)  Any statement made by the defendant in the course of any competency
            
110

    
examination, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, any
            
111

    
testimony by the expert based upon such statement, and any other fruits of the statement may
            
112

    
not be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an
            
113

    
issue respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.  The
            
114

    
evidence may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the defendant's
            
115

    
competency.
            
116

    
    (b)  Prior to examining the defendant, examiners should specifically advise the
            
117

    
defendant of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection (8)(a).
            
118

    
    (9)  When the report is received the court shall set a date for a mental hearing which
            
119

    
shall be held in not less than five and not more than 15 days, unless the court enlarges the time
            
120

    
for good cause.  Any person or organization directed by the department to conduct the

            
121


    
examination may be subpoenaed to testify at the hearing.  If the experts are in conflict as to the
            
122

    
competency of the defendant, all experts should be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably
            
123

    
available.  The court may call any examiner to testify at the hearing who is not called by the
            
124

    
parties.  If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross-examine the expert.
            
125

    
    (10)  A person shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of the
            
126

    
evidence, finds the person incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the proponent
            
127

    
of incompetency at the hearing.  An adjudication of incompetency to proceed shall not operate
            
128

    
as an adjudication of incompetency to give informed consent for medical treatment or for any
            
129

    
other purpose, unless specifically set forth in the court order.
            
130

    
    (11) (a)  The court, in determining the defendant's competency to stand trial, shall
            
131

    
consider the totality of the circumstances, which includes the information presented under
            
132

    
Subsection (11)(b) in addition to the expert testimony, studies, and reports provided under this
            
133

    
section.
            
134

    
    (b)  The information to be considered by the court shall include all available and
            
135

    
relevant evidence, witnesses, and testimony to ensure that there is no manipulation of the
            
136

    
process or a wrongful or artificial attempt or motivation on the part of the defendant to avoid
            
137

    
being found competent to stand trial.
            
138

    
    (c)  All witnesses and evidence regarding the defendant's personal contact with
            
139

    
individuals which may relate to the competency of the defendant to stand trial shall be
            
140

    
considered by the court and applied to its determination of the defendant's competency under
            
141

    
this section.
            
142

    
    [(11)] (12) (a)  If the court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, its order shall
            
143

    
contain findings addressing each of the factors in Subsections (4)(a) and (b) of this section. 
            
144

    
The order issued pursuant to Subsection 

77-15-6

145

    
the defendant is committed or to the person who is responsible for assessing his progress
            
146

    
toward competency shall be provided contemporaneously with the transportation and
            
147

    
commitment order of the defendant, unless exigent circumstances require earlier commitment
            
148

    
in which case the court shall forward the order within five working days of the order of
            
149

    
transportation and commitment of the defendant.
            
150

    
    (b)  The order finding the defendant incompetent to stand trial shall be accompanied by:
            
151

    
    (i)  copies of the reports of the experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of

            
152


    
examination if not provided previously;
            
153

    
    (ii)  copies of any of the psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports submitted to
            
154

    
the court relative to the mental condition of the defendant; and
            
155

    
    (iii)  any other documents made available to the court by either the defense or the
            
156

    
prosecution, pertaining to the defendant's current or past mental condition.
            
157

    
    [(12)] (13) (a)  If the court finds it necessary to order the defendant transported prior to
            
158

    
the completion of findings and compilation of documents required under Subsection [(11)]
            
159

    
(12), the transportation and commitment order delivering the defendant to the Utah State
            
160

    
Hospital, or other mental health facility as directed by the executive director of the Department
            
161

    
of Human Services or his designee, shall indicate that the defendant's commitment is based
            
162

    
upon a finding of incompetency, and the mental health facility's copy of the order shall be
            
163

    
accompanied by the reports of any experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of
            
164

    
examination.
            
165

    
    (b)  The executive director of the Department of Human Services or his designee may
            
166

    
refuse to accept a defendant as a patient unless he is accompanied by a transportation and
            
167

    
commitment order which is accompanied by the reports.
            
168

    
    [(13)] (14)  Upon a finding of incompetency to stand trial by the court, the prosecuting
            
169

    
and defense attorneys shall provide information and materials relevant to the defendant's
            
170

    
competency to the facility where the defendant is committed or to the person responsible for

assessing his progress towards competency.  In addition to any other materials, the prosecuting
            
172

    
attorney shall provide:
            
173

    
    (a)  copies of the charging document and supporting affidavits or other documents used
            
174

    
in the determination of probable cause;
            
175

    
    (b)  arrest or incident reports prepared by a law enforcement agency pertaining to the
            
176

    
charged offense; and
            
177

    
    (c)  information concerning the defendant's known criminal history.
            
178

    
    [(14)] (15)  The court may make any reasonable order to insure compliance with this

180

    
    [(15)] (16)  Failure to comply with this section shall not result in the dismissal of

    Section 2.  
Section

     77-15-6.  Commitment on finding of incompetency to stand trial -- Subsequent
            
184

    
 hearings -- Notice to prosecuting attorneys.
            
185

    
    (1)  Except as provided in Subsection (5), if after hearing[,] the person is found to be
            
186

    
incompetent to stand trial, the court shall order the defendant committed to the custody of the
            
187

    
executive director of the Department of Human Services or his designee for the purpose of
            
188

    
treatment intended to restore the defendant to competency.  The court may recommend but not
            
189

    
order placement of the defendant.  The court may, however, order that the defendant be placed
            
190

    
in a secure setting rather than a nonsecure setting.  The director or his designee shall designate
            
191

    
the specific placement of the defendant during the period of evaluation and treatment to restore
            
192

    
competency.
            
193

    
    (2)  The examiner or examiners designated by the executive director to assess the
            
194

    
defendant's progress toward competency may not be involved in the routine treatment of the

defendant.  The examiner or examiners shall provide a full report to the court and prosecuting
            
196

    
and defense attorneys within 90 days of arrival of the defendant at the treating facility.  If any
            
197

    
examiner is unable to complete the assessment within 90 days, that examiner shall provide to
            
198

    
the court and counsel a summary progress report which informs the court that additional time is
            
199

    
necessary to complete the assessment, in which case the examiner shall have up to an
            
200

    
additional 90 days to provide the full report.  The full report shall assess:
            
201

    
    (a)  the facility's or program's capacity to provide appropriate treatment for the
            
202

    
defendant;
            
203

    
    (b)  the nature of treatments provided to the defendant;
            
204

    
    (c)  what progress toward competency restoration has been made with respect to the
            
205

    
factors identified by the court in its initial order;
            
206

    
    (d)  the defendant's current level of mental disorder or mental retardation and need for
            
207

    
treatment, if any; and
            
208

    
    (e)  the likelihood of restoration of competency and the amount of time estimated to
            
209

    
achieve it.
            
210

    
    (3)  The court on its own motion or upon motion by either party or by the executive
            
211

    
director may appoint additional mental health examiners to examine the defendant and advise
            
212

    
the court on his current mental status and progress toward competency restoration.
            
213

    
    (4)  Upon receipt of the full report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the

            
214


    
defendant's current status.  At the hearing, the burden of proving that the defendant is
            
215

    
competent is on the proponent of competency.  Following the hearing, the court shall determine
            
216

    
by a preponderance of evidence whether the defendant is:
            
217

    
    (a)  competent to stand trial;
            
218

    
    (b)  incompetent to stand trial with a substantial probability that the defendant may
            
219

    
become competent in the foreseeable future; or
            
220

    
    (c)  incompetent to stand trial without a substantial probability that the defendant may
            
221

    
become competent in the foreseeable future.
            
222

    
    (5) (a)  If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection (4)(a), the court shall
            
223

    
proceed with the trial or such other procedures as may be necessary to adjudicate the charges.
            
224

    
    (b)  If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection (4)(b), the court may order that
            
225

    
the defendant remain committed to the custody of the executive director of the Department of
            
226

    
Human Services or his designee for the purpose of treatment intended to restore the defendant
            
227

    
to competency.
            
228

    
    (c)  If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection (4)(c), the court shall order [the
            
229

    
defendant released from the custody of the director unless the prosecutor informs the court]
            
230

    
that commitment proceedings pursuant to Title 62A, Chapter 5, Services [to] for People with
            
231

    
Disabilities, or Title 62A, Chapter 15, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Act, will be
            
232

    
initiated.  These commitment proceedings must be initiated within seven days after the court's
            
233

    
order entering the finding in Subsection (4)(c), unless the court enlarges the time for good
            
234

    
cause shown.  The defendant may be ordered to remain in the custody of the director until
            
235

    
commitment proceedings have been concluded.  If the defendant is committed, the court which
            
236

    
entered the order pursuant to Subsection (4)(c), shall be notified by the director at least 10 days
            
237

    
prior to any release of the committed person.
            
238

    
    (6)  If the defendant is recommitted to the department pursuant to Subsection (5)(b), the
            
239

    
court shall hold a hearing one year following the recommitment.
            
240

    
    (7)  At the hearing held pursuant to Subsection (6), except for defendants charged with
            
241

    
the crimes listed in Subsection (8), a defendant who has not been restored to competency shall
            
242

    
be [ordered released or] temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under the
            
243

    
same terms as provided in Subsection (5)(c).
            
244

    
    (8)  If the defendant has been charged with aggravated murder, murder, attempted

            
245


    
murder, manslaughter, or a first degree felony and the court determines that the defendant is
            
246

    
making reasonable progress towards restoration of competency at the time of the hearing held
            
247

    
pursuant to Subsection (6), the court may order the defendant recommitted for a period not to
            
248

    
exceed 18 months for the purpose of treatment to restore the defendant to competency with a
            
249

    
mandatory review hearing at the end of the 18-month period.
            
250

    
    (9)  Except for defendants charged with aggravated murder or murder, a defendant who
            
251

    
has not been restored to competency at the time of the hearing held pursuant to Subsection (8)
            
252

    
shall be [ordered released or] temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings
            
253

    
under the same terms as provided in Subsection (5)(c).
            
254

    
    (10)  If the defendant has been charged with aggravated murder or murder and the court
            
255

    
determines that he is making reasonable progress towards restoration of competency at the time
            
256

    
of the mandatory review hearing held pursuant to Subsection (8), the court may order the
            
257

    
defendant recommitted for a period not to exceed 36 months for the purpose of treatment to
            
258

    
restore him to competency.
            
259

    
    (11)  If the defendant is recommitted to the department pursuant to Subsection (10), the
            
260

    
court shall hold a hearing no later than at 18-month intervals following the recommitment for
            
261

    
the purpose of determining the defendant's competency status.
            
262

    
    (12)  A defendant who has not been restored to competency at the expiration of the
            
263

    
additional 36-month commitment period ordered pursuant to Subsection (10) shall be [ordered
            
264

    
released or] temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under the same terms
            
265

    
as provided in Subsection (5)(c).
            
266

    
    (13)  In no event may the maximum period of detention under this section exceed the
            
267

    
maximum period of incarceration which the defendant could receive if he were convicted of
            
268

    
the charged offense.  This Subsection (13) does not preclude pursuing involuntary civil
            
269

    
commitment nor does it place any time limit on civil commitments.
            
270

    
    (14)  Neither release from a pretrial incompetency commitment under the provisions of
            
271

    
this section nor civil commitment requires dismissal of criminal charges.  The court may retain
            
272

    
jurisdiction over the criminal case and may order periodic reviews to assess the defendant's
            
273

    
competency to stand trial.
            
274

    
    (15)  A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to Title 62A, Chapter 5, Services
            
275

    
[to] for People with Disabilities, or Title 62A, Chapter 15, Substance Abuse and Mental Health

            
276


    
Act, may still be adjudicated competent to stand trial under this chapter.
            
277

    
    (16) (a)  The remedy for a violation of the time periods specified in this section, other
            
278

    
than those specified in Subsection (5)(c), (7), (9), (12), or (13), shall be a motion to compel the
            
279

    
hearing, or mandamus, but not release from detention or dismissal of the criminal charges.
            
280

    
    (b)  The remedy for a violation of the time periods specified in Subsection (5)(c), (7),
            
281

    
(9), (12), or (13) shall not be dismissal of the criminal charges.
            
282

    
    (17)  In cases in which the treatment of the defendant is precluded by court order for a
            
283

    
period of time, that time period may not be considered in computing time limitations under this
            
284

    
section.
            
285

    
    (18)  At any time that the defendant becomes competent to stand trial, the clinical
            
286

    
director of the hospital or other facility or the executive director of the Department of Human
            
287

    
Services shall certify that fact to the court.  The court shall conduct a hearing within 15
            
288

    
working days of the receipt of the clinical director's or executive director's report, unless the
            
289

    
court enlarges the time for good cause.
            
290

    
    (19)  The court may order a hearing or rehearing at any time on its own motion or upon
            
291

    
recommendations of the clinical director of the hospital or other facility or the executive
            
292

    
director of the Department of Human Services.
            
293

    
    (20)  Notice of a hearing on competency to stand trial shall be given to the prosecuting
            
294

    
attorney.  If the hearing is held in the county where the defendant is confined, notice shall also
            
295

    
be given to the prosecuting attorney for that county.
            
296

    
    Section 3.  
Section  
77-15-6.5

 is amended to read:
            
297

    
     77-15-6.5.  Petition for involuntary medication of incompetent defendant.
            
298

    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
299

    
    (a)  "Executive director" means the executive director of the Department of Human
            
300

    
Services or the executive director's designee.
            
301

    
    (b)  "Final order" means a court order that determines the rights of the parties and
            
302

    
concerning which appellate remedies have been exhausted or the time for appeal has expired.
            
303

    
    (2) (a)  At any time after a defendant has been found incompetent to proceed and has
            
304

    
been committed to the Department of Human Services under Section 

77-15-6

 for treatment to
            
305

    
restore competency, the executive director shall notify the court, prosecuting attorney, and
            
306

    
attorney for the defendant if the executive director has determined that the defendant is not

            
307


    
responding to treatment and is unlikely to be restored to competency without the involuntary
            
308

    
administration of antipsychotic medication.
            
309

    
    (b)  The executive director shall provide the notification under Subsection (2)(a) only if
            
310

    
there is no basis for involuntarily medicating the defendant for reasons other than to restore the
            
311

    
defendant's competency.
            
312

    
    (3)  In the notice under Subsection (2)(a), the executive director shall state whether the
            
313

    
executive director believes:
            
314

    
    (a)  medication is necessary to render the defendant competent;
            
315

    
    (b)  medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent;
            
316

    
    (c)  medication is substantially unlikely to produce side effects which would
            
317

    
significantly interfere with the defendant's ability to assist in his defense;
            
318

    
    (d)  no less intrusive means are available, and whether any of those means have been
            
319

    
attempted to render the defendant competent; and
            
320

    
    (e)  medication is medically appropriate and is in the defendant's best medical interest
            
321

    
in light of his medical condition.
            
322

    
    (4) (a)  Upon receipt of the notice under Subsection (2)(a), the court shall conduct a
            
323

    
hearing within 30 days, unless the court extends the time for good cause, to determine whether
            
324

    
the court should convene a hearing regarding the involuntary medication of the defendant.
            
325

    
    (b)  The prosecuting attorney shall represent the state at any hearing under this section.
            
326

    
    (c)  The court shall consider whether the following factors apply in determining
            
327

    
whether the defendant should be involuntarily medicated:
            
328

    
    (i)  important state interests are at stake in restoring the defendant's competency;
            
329

    
    (ii)  involuntary medication will significantly further the important state interests, in
            
330

    
that the medication proposed:
            
331

    
    (A)  is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial; and
            
332

    
    (B)  is substantially unlikely to produce side effects which would significantly interfere
            
333

    
with the defendant's ability to assist the defense counsel in conducting his defense;
            
334

    
    (iii)  involuntary medication is necessary to further important state interests, because
            
335

    
any alternate less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results; and
            
336

    
    (iv)  the administration of the proposed medication is medically appropriate, as it is in
            
337

    
the defendant's best medical interest in light of his medical condition.

            
338


    
    (5)  In determining whether the proposed treatment is medically appropriate and is in
            
339

    
the defendant's best medical interest, the potential penalty the defendant may be subject to, if
            
340

    
the defendant is convicted of any charged offense, is not a relevant consideration.
            
341

    
    (6) (a)  If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the involuntary
            
342

    
administration of antipsychotic medication is appropriate, it shall make findings addressing
            
343

    
each of the factors in Subsection (4)(c) and shall issue an order authorizing the Department of
            
344

    
Human Services to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication to the defendant in order
            
345

    
to restore his competency, subject to the periodic reviews and other procedures provided in
            
346

    
Section 

77-15-6

.
            
347

    
    (b)  When issuing an order under Subsection (6)(a), the court shall consider ordering
            
348

    
less intrusive means for administering the drugs, such as a court order to the defendant
            
349

    
enforceable by the contempt power, before ordering more intrusive methods of involuntary
            
350

    
medication.
            
351

    
    (7)  The provisions in Section 

77-15-6

 establishing time limitations for treatment of
            
352

    
incompetent defendants before they must [be either released or civilly committed] undergo
            
353

    
civil commitment proceedings are tolled from the time the executive director gives notice to
            
354

    
the court and the parties under Subsection (2) until:
            
355

    
    (a)  the court has issued a final order for the involuntary medication of the defendant,
            
356

    
and the defendant has been medicated under that order; or
            
357

    
    (b)  the court has issued a final order that the defendant will not be involuntarily
            
358

    
medicated.
            
359

    
    (8)  This section applies only when the prosecution seeks an order of involuntary
            
360

    
medication solely for the purpose of rendering a defendant competent to proceed.
