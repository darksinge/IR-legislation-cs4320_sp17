Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 598 (1997), described the asbestos litigation as a "crisis";(g)  attorney-sponsored x-ray screenings have been used to amass large numbers ofclaims by unimpaired plaintiffs;(h)  approximately 100 employers have declared bankruptcy at least partially because ofasbestos-related liability;(i)  these bankruptcies have resulted in a search for more solvent companies byclaimants, resulting in over 10,000 companies being named as asbestos defendants, includingmany small- and medium-sized companies, in industries that cover 85% of the United Stateseconomy;(j)  silica is a naturally occurring mineral and is the basic component of sand, quartz,and granite;(k)  silica-related illness, including silicosis, can develop from the prolonged inhalationof respirable silica particles;(l)  silica claims, like asbestos claims, have involved individuals with no demonstrablephysical impairment, and plaintiffs have been identified through for-profit screeningcompanies;(m)  silica screening processes have been found subject to substantial abuse andpotential fraud;(n)  the cost of compensating plaintiffs who have no present asbestos-related orsilica-related physical impairment, and the cost of litigating their claims, jeopardizes the abilityof defendants to compensate plaintiffs with cancer and adversely affects defendant companies;(o)  concerns about statutes of limitations and available funds can prompt unimpairedplaintiffs to bring asbestos and silica actions to protect their rights to future compensationshould they become impaired; and(p)  the public interest requires giving priority to the claims of exposed individuals whoare sick in order to help preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability to compensatepeople who develop cancer and other serious asbestos-related diseases, as well as silica-relatedinjuries, and to safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of workers in this state and thewell-being of this state's economy.(2)  This part is enacted to:(a)  give priority to asbestos and silica claimants who can demonstrate physicalimpairment caused by exposure to asbestos or silica;(b)  toll the running of statutes of limitations for persons who have been exposed toasbestos or to silica, but who have no present physical impairment caused by the exposure;(c)  enhance the ability of the courts to supervise and manage asbestos and silica cases;(d)  reduce the opportunity for fraud in asbestos and silica litigation; and(e)  conserve defendants' resources to allow compensation to present and futureclaimants with physical impairment caused by exposure to asbestos or silica.     78B-6-2103.As used in this part:(1)  "AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment" means the AmericanMedical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment in effect at the timeof the performance of any examination or test on the exposed person required under this part.(2)  "Asbestos" means the same as that term is defined in Section 78B-6-2003.(3)  "Asbestos action" means the same as that term is defined in Section 78B-6-2003.(4)  "Asbestosis" means bilateral diffuse interstitial fibrosis of the lungs caused byinhalation of asbestos fibers.(5)  "Board-certified in occupational medicine" means a physician who is certified inthe specialty of occupational medicine by the American Board of Preventive Medicine or thespecialty of occupational/environmental medicine by the American Osteopathic Board ofPreventive Medicine and whose certification was current at the time of the performance of anexamination and rendition of a report required by this part.(6)  "Board-certified in oncology" means a physician who is certified in the specialty ofmedical oncology by the American Board of Internal Medicine or specialty of oncology by theAmerican Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine and whose certification was current at thetime of the performance of an examination and rendition of a report required by this part.(7)  "Board-certified in pathology" means a physician who holds primary certification inanatomic pathology or clinical pathology from the American Board of Pathology or theAmerican Osteopathic Board of Pathology, whose certification was current at the time of theperformance of an examination and rendition of a report required by this part, and whoseprofessional practice is principally in the field of pathology involving regular evaluation ofpathology materials obtained from surgical or postmortem specimens.(8)  "Board-certified in pulmonary medicine" means a physician who is certified in thespecialty of pulmonary medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine or the AmericanOsteopathic Board of Internal Medicine and whose certification was current at the time of theperformance of an examination and rendition of a report required by this part.(9)  "Certified B-reader" means an individual who has qualified as a National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) final or B-reader of x-rays under 42 C.F.R.

causes.(3)  A qualified physician's opinion stating that the medical findings and primary canceror physical impairment are "consistent with" or "compatible with" exposure to silica, or wordsto that effect, does not satisfy the requirement described in Subsection (2)(c).(4)  The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing and determine if the exposed person hasestablished a prima facie showing of a primary cancer or physical impairment to whichexposure to silica was a substantial contributing factor.     78B-6-2109.Evidence relating to physical impairment under this part, including pulmonary functiontesting and diffusing studies, offered in an action governed by this part, shall satisfy thefollowing requirements:(1)  the evidence shall comply with the quality controls, equipment requirements,methods of calibration and techniques set forth in the AMA Guides to the Evaluation ofPermanent Impairment, and all standards set forth in the official statements of the AmericanThoracic Society, which are in effect on the date of any examination or pulmonary functiontesting of the exposed person required by this part;(2)  the evidence may not be obtained by, or based on, testing or examinations thatviolate any law, regulation, licensing requirement, or medical code of practice of the state inwhich the examination, test, or screening was conducted, or of this state; and(3)  the evidence may not be obtained under the condition that the plaintiff or exposedperson retains the legal services of the attorney or law firm sponsoring the examination, test, orscreening.     78B-6-2110.(1)  The existence of evidence relating to the prima facie showings required in this partdoes not create a presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos-related or silica-relatedinjury or impairment and may not be conclusive as to the liability of any defendant.(2)  Evidence may not be offered at trial, and the jury may not be informed, of:(a)  the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss an asbestos or silica action under theprovisions of this part; or(b)  the provisions of this part with respect to what constitutes a prima facie showing ofasbestos or silica-related impairment.(3)  Until a court enters an order determining that the exposed person has establishedprima facie evidence of impairment, an asbestos or silica action may not be subject todiscovery, except:(a)  discovery related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence; or(b)  by order of the trial court upon motion of a party and for good cause shown.(4) (a)  A court may consolidate for trial any number and type of asbestos or silicaactions with the consent of all the parties.(b)  In the absence of consent described in Subsection (4)(a), the court may consolidatefor trial only asbestos or silica actions relating to the exposed person and members of thatperson's household.(c)  No class action or any other form of mass aggregation relating to more than oneexposed person and members of those persons' households may be permitted.(d)  The provisions of this Subsection (4) do not preclude consolidation of cases bycourt order for pretrial or discovery purposes.     78B-6-2111.(1)  A premises owner, or any entity performing operations on a premises, is not liablein an asbestos or silica action for exposures that do not occur on the premises.(2)  A defendant in an asbestos or silica action may not be liable for exposures from aproduct or component part made or sold by a third party, even if the third party is insolvent orotherwise not amenable to suit.(3)  Punitive damages may not be awarded in an asbestos or silica action.     78B-6-2112.The following standards for proof of causation apply in any asbestos action involvingmultiple sources of exposures:(1)  proof of "any exposure" to a defendant's product may not suffice and instead theplaintiff shall establish the dose of asbestos fibers to which the exposed person was exposed tofrom each defendant's product;(2)  the dose shall be quantified but need not be established with mathematicalprecision;(3)  the plaintiff shall establish that the defendant's product was a substantial factor incausing the plaintiff's disease;(4)  the defendant's product is not a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's disease if,in light of the evidence of the plaintiff's total exposure to asbestos or other toxins, reasonablepersons would not regard the defendant's product as a cause of the disease; and(5)  the plaintiff, in the absence of direct evidence of causation, shall prove substantialfactor causation with scientifically reliable expert testimony that the plaintiff's exposure to thedefendant's product more than doubled the plaintiff's risk of contracting the disease.     78B-6-2113.(1)  The period of limitations for an asbestos or silica action that is not barred as of May10, 2016, may not accrue, nor may the running of limitations commence, prior to the earlier ofthe date the exposed person:(a)  received a medical diagnosis of an asbestos-related impairment or silica-relatedimpairment;(b)  discovered facts that would have led a reasonable person to obtain a medicaldiagnosis with respect to the existence of an asbestos-related impairment or silica-relatedimpairment; or(c)  died having an asbestos-related or silica-related impairment.(2)  Nothing in this section may be construed to revive or extend limitations withrespect to any claim for asbestos- or silica-related impairment that was otherwise time-barredas of May 10, 2016.(3)  Nothing in this section may be construed to adversely affect, impair, limit, modify,or nullify any settlement or other agreements with respect to an asbestos or silica action enteredinto before May 10, 2016.(4)  An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant condition shall be adistinct cause of action from an action for an asbestos-related or silica-related cancer.(5)  If otherwise permitted under state law, damages may not be awarded in an asbestosor silica action for fear of increased risk of future disease.     78B-6-2114.(1)  This part applies to asbestos and silica actions filed on or after May 10, 2016, aswell as any pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not commenced as of May 10,2016.(2)  This part may only be applied prospectively if the application of a provision in thispart would unconstitutionally affect a vested right.Full text:

Findings and purpose. 249          (1)  The Legislature finds that:250          (a)  asbestos is a mineral that was widely used before the 1980s for insulation,251     fireproofing, and other purposes;252          (b)  millions of American workers and others were exposed to asbestos, especially253     during and after World War II, and before the issuance of regulations by the Occupational254     Safety and Health Administration in the early 1970s;255          (c)  long-term exposure to asbestos has been associated with various types of cancer,256     including mesothelioma and lung cancer, as well as nonmalignant conditions such as asbestosis257     and diffuse pleural thickening;258          (d)  diseases caused by asbestos often have long latency periods;259          (e)  although the use of asbestos has dramatically declined since the 1970s and260     workplace exposures have been regulated since 1971 by the Occupational Safety and Health261     Administration, past exposures will continue to result in significant claims of death and262     disability as a result of the exposure;263          (f)  the United States Supreme Court in Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 264     591, 598 (1997), described the asbestos litigation as a "crisis";265          (g)  attorney-sponsored x-ray screenings have been used to amass large numbers of266     claims by unimpaired plaintiffs;267          (h)  approximately 100 employers have declared bankruptcy at least partially because of268     asbestos-related liability;269          (i)  these bankruptcies have resulted in a search for more solvent companies by270     claimants, resulting in over 10,000 companies being named as asbestos defendants, including271     many small- and medium-sized companies, in industries that cover 85% of the United States272     economy;273          (j)  silica is a naturally occurring mineral and is the basic component of sand, quartz,274     and granite;275          (k)  silica-related illness, including silicosis, can develop from the prolonged inhalation276     of respirable silica particles;277          (l)  silica claims, like asbestos claims, have involved individuals with no demonstrable278     physical impairment, and plaintiffs have been identified through for-profit screening279     companies;280          (m)  silica screening processes have been found subject to substantial abuse and281     potential fraud;282          (n)  the cost of compensating plaintiffs who have no present asbestos-related or283     silica-related physical impairment, and the cost of litigating their claims, jeopardizes the ability284     of defendants to compensate plaintiffs with cancer and adversely affects defendant companies;285          (o)  concerns about statutes of limitations and available funds can prompt unimpaired286     plaintiffs to bring asbestos and silica actions to protect their rights to future compensation287     should they become impaired; and288          (p)  the public interest requires giving priority to the claims of exposed individuals who289     are sick in order to help preserve, now and for the future, defendants' ability to compensate290     people who develop cancer and other serious asbestos-related diseases, as well as silica-related291     injuries, and to safeguard the jobs, benefits, and savings of workers in this state and the292     well-being of this state's economy.293          (2)  This part is enacted to:294          (a)  give priority to asbestos and silica claimants who can demonstrate physical295     impairment caused by exposure to asbestos or silica;296          (b)  toll the running of statutes of limitations for persons who have been exposed to297     asbestos or to silica, but who have no present physical impairment caused by the exposure;298          (c)  enhance the ability of the courts to supervise and manage asbestos and silica cases;299          (d)  reduce the opportunity for fraud in asbestos and silica litigation; and300          (e)  conserve defendants' resources to allow compensation to present and future301     claimants with physical impairment caused by exposure to asbestos or silica. 302          Section 11.
