91

92

    
absence of proof to the contrary, that the injured persons who dealt indirectly with the
            
93

    
defendant incurred at least 1/3 of the damages, and shall, therefore, recover at least 1/3 of the
            
94

    
awarded damages.  The final 1/3 of the damages shall be awarded by the court to those injured
            
95

    
persons determined by the court as most likely to have absorbed the damages.
            
96

    
    (8)  There is a presumption, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that each level in a
            
97

    
product's or service's distribution chain passed on any and all increments in its cost due to an
            
98

    
increase in the cost of an ingredient or a component product or service that was caused by a
            
99

    
violation of this act.  This amount will be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
            
100

    
to be equal to the change in the cost, in dollars and cents, of the ingredient, component product,
            
101

    
or service to its first purchaser.

104

    
general shall receive a copy of each filing from each plaintiff.  The attorney general may, in his
            
105

    
or her discretion, intervene or file amicus briefs in the case, and may be heard on the question
            
106

    
of the fairness or appropriateness of any proposed settlement agreement.
            
107

    
    (10)  If, in a class action or parens patriae action filed under this act, including the
            
108

    
settlement of any action, it is not feasible to return any part of the recovery to the injured
            
109

    
plaintiffs, the court shall order the residual funds be applied to benefit the specific class of
            
110

    
injured plaintiffs, to improve antitrust enforcement generally by depositing the residual funds
            
111

    
into the Attorney General Litigation Fund created by Section 

76-10-922

, or both.

113

    
arrangements for the payment of attorney's fees, including contingency fee agreements.
