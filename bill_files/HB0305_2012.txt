 Highlighted Provisions:
            
11

    
    This bill:
            
12

    
    .    modifies a provision requiring an engineer evaluation of certain buildings built
            
13

    
before 1975;
            
14

    
    .    eliminates a requirement that the evaluation occur when the building is undergoing
            
15

    
reroofing or an alteration of or repair to certain features; and
            
16

    
    .    replaces that requirement with a requirement that the evaluation occur when the
            
17

    
building is undergoing structural alterations or repairs, and specifies what is not
            
18

    
included in structural alterations or repairs.
            
19

    
 Money Appropriated in this Bill:

27

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

 is amended to read:
            
29

    
     15A-3-113.   Amendments to Chapters 32 through 35 of IBC.
            
30

    
    (1)  A new section IBC, Section 3401.6, is added as follows: "3401.6 Parapet bracing,
            
31

    
wall anchors, and other appendages.  Buildings constructed before 1975 shall have parapet
            
32

    
bracing, wall anchors, and appendages such as cornices, spires, towers, tanks, signs, statuary,
            
33

    
etc. evaluated by a licensed engineer when [said] the building is undergoing [reroofing, or
            
34

    
alteration of or repair to said feature.] structural alterations or structural repairs.  Reroofing or
            
35

    
water membrane replacement may not be considered a structural alteration or repair for
            
36

    
purposes of this section.  Such parapet bracing, wall anchors, and appendages shall be
            
37

    
evaluated in accordance with 75% of the seismic forces as specified in Section 1613.  When
            
38

    
allowed by the local building official, alternate methods of equivalent strength as referenced in
            
39

    
an approved code under Utah Code, Subsection 

15A-1-204

(6)(a), will be considered when
            
40

    
accompanied by engineer-sealed drawings, details, and calculations.  When found to be
            
41

    
deficient because of design or deteriorated condition, the engineer's recommendations to
            
42

    
anchor, brace, reinforce, or remove the deficient feature shall be implemented.
            
43

    
Exceptions:
            
44

    
1.  Group R-3 and U occupancies.
            
45

    
2.  Unreinforced masonry parapets need not be braced according to the above stated provisions
            
46

    
provided that the maximum height of an unreinforced masonry parapet above the level of the
            
47

    
diaphragm tension anchors or above the parapet braces shall not exceed one and one-half times
            
48

    
the thickness of the parapet wall.  The parapet height may be a maximum of two and one-half
            
49

    
times its thickness in other than Seismic Design Categories D, E, or F."
            
50

    
    (2)  IBC, Section 3408.4, is deleted and replaced with the following: "3408.4 Change in
            
51

    
Occupancy.  When a change in occupancy results in a structure being reclassified to a higher
            
52

    
Occupancy Category (as defined in Table 1604.5), or when such change of occupancy results in
            
53

    
a design occupant load increase of 100% or more, the structure shall conform to the seismic
            
54

    
requirements for a new structure.
            
55

    
Exceptions:
            
56

    
1.  Specific seismic detailing requirements of this code or ASCE 7 for a new structure shall not
            
57

    
be required to be met where it can be shown that the level of performance and seismic safety is
            
58

    
equivalent to that of a new structure.  Such analysis shall consider the regularity, overstrength,

            
59


    
redundancy, and ductility of the structure within the context of the existing and retrofit (if any)
            
60

    
detailing providing.  Alternatively, the building official may allow the structure to be upgraded
            
61

    
in accordance with referenced sections as found in an approved code under Utah Code,
            
62

    
Subsection 

15A-1-204

(6)(a).
            
63

    
2.  When a change of use results in a structure being reclassified from Occupancy Category I or
            
64

    
II to Occupancy Category III and the structure is located in a seismic map area where SDS is
            
65

    
less than 0.33, compliance with the seismic requirements of this code and ASCE 7 are not
            
66

    
required.
            
67

    
3.  Where design occupant load increase is less than 25 occupants and the Occupancy Category
            
68

    
does not change."
            
69

    
    (3)  In IBC, Section 3411.1, the exception is deleted and replaced with the following:
            
70

    
"Exception: Type B dwelling or sleeping units required by Section 1107 of this code are not
            
71

    
required to be provided in existing buildings and facilities unless being altered or undergoing a
            
72

    
change of occupancy classification."
