 This act modifies the Utah Coordinate System.  The act adopts special publications to more
            

    
 precisely define the Utah Coordinate Systems of 1927 and 1983.  The act modifies the
            

    
 requirements for any document identifying or using a coordinate system.  The act establishes
            

    
 that, in addition to the Utah Coordinate System of 1983, any person, corporation, municipality,
            

    
 county, or state agency establishing a new coordinate network must conform to the current
            

    
 federal coordinate update.
            

    
This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated 1953 as follows:
