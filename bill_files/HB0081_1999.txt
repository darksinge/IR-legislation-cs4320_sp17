If the conviction and                            commitment occurred prior to January  ,     , the burden is on the prosecution to establish by a                            preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was then represented by counsel or had lawfully                            waived his right to have counsel present, and that his plea was understandingly and voluntarily                               entered.                                 e   If the court finds this section applicable, it shall enter that specific finding on the record                            and shall indicate in the order of judgment and commitment that the defendant has been found by                            the court to be a habitual violent offender and is sentenced under this section.                                     The habitual violent offender provisions of this section are not an element of the                            offense, and proof of a defendant s conduct as a habitual violent offender is not necessary at a                            preliminary hearing or at trial.                                     a   The sentencing enhancement provisions of Sections                  and                  shall                            apply to a felony conviction defined in Title   , Chapter  , Part  , Sexual Offenses, and shall                            supersede the provisions of this section.                                 b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a                                   i   the convictions under Sections                  and         a       shall be governed by the                            enhancement provisions of this section  and                                 ii   the  violent felony  offense defined in Subsection     c  shall include any felony sexual                            offense violation of Title   , Chapter  , Part  , Sexual Offenses, to determine if the convicted                            person is a habitual violent offender.

A copy shall be served upon the                            county attorney or, if within a prosecution district the district attorney, in the county of the seizure,                            who shall answer the petition within    days.  A petitioner under this subsection need not answer                            a complaint of forfeiture.                                 f   After    days following service of a complaint or petition for release, the court shall                            examine the record and if no answer is on file, the court shall allow the complainant or petitioner                            an opportunity to present evidence in support of his claim and order forfeiture or release of the                            vehicle as the court determines.  If the county attorney or district attorney has not filed an answer                            to a petition for release and the court determines from the evidence that the petitioner is not                            entitled to recovery of the vehicle, it shall enter an order directing the county attorney or district                            attorney to answer the petition within ten days.

The                               court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence the issues in the case and order forfeiture                            or release of the vehicle as it determines.                                 h   Proceedings of this section are independent of any other proceedings, whether civil or                            criminal, under the laws of this state.                                 i   When the court determines that claimants have no right in the vehicle in whole or in                            part, it shall declare the vehicle to be forfeited and direct it to be delivered for disposition in                            accordance with Subsection    .                                 j   When the court determines that the vehicle, in whole or in part, is not subject to                            forfeiture, it shall order release of the vehicle to the proper claimant.

When any vehicle is forfeited under this section by a finding of the court that no person                            is entitled to recover it or that the vehicle is subject to forfeiture in part and release in part to a                            claimant, a court shall order that the vehicle be delivered to the seizing agency for sale as the court                            directs.  The court shall also order that the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle be distributed in                            accordance with the provisions of Subsection     j .                                     When the court orders that a vehicle be forfeited, in whole or in part, under this section,                            it shall direct that the proceeds from the sale of the forfeited vehicle, or part thereof, be divided or                            distributed as follows                                  a       to the agency making the seizure  and                                 b       to the state treasurer for deposit into the General Fund.                                     If the vehicle is found by the court not to be subject to forfeiture, it shall be released                               to the owner.                                 Section  .
