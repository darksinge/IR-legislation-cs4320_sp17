186

    
    (1)  On petition of the ward or any person interested in the ward's welfare, the court
            
187

    
may remove a guardian and appoint a successor if in the best interests of the ward.  On petition
            
188

    
of the guardian, the court may accept the guardian's resignation and make any other order

which may be appropriate.
            
190

    
    (2)  An order adjudicating incapacity may specify a minimum period, not exceeding one
            
191

    
year, during which no petition for an adjudication that the ward is no longer incapacitated may

be filed without special leave.  Subject to this restriction, the ward or any person interested in
            
193

    
the ward's welfare may petition for an order that the ward is no longer incapacitated and for
            
194

in Section 

75-5-303

.  The court is not required to appoint an attorney to represent the ward if

the case is uncontested and the ward's incapacity is not at issue.

    Section 6.

    (1) Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order
            
205

    
because of minority, the court shall set a date for the hearing on the matters alleged in the
            
206

    
petition. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the minor
            
207

    
are or may be inadequately represented, it may appoint an attorney to represent the minor,
            
208

    
giving consideration to the choice of the minor if 14 years of age or older.  [A lawyer] An

attorney appointed by the court to represent a minor has the powers and duties of a guardian ad
            
210

    
litem.
            
211

    
    (2)  Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order
            
212

    
for reasons other than minority, the court shall set a date for hearing. Unless the person to be
            
213

    
protected has already retained counsel [of his own choice], the court may appoint [a lawyer] an

            
214


    
attorney to represent [him] the person to be protected who then has the powers and duties of a
            
215

    
guardian ad litem.
            
216

    
    (3)  The legal representation of the protected person by an attorney shall terminate upon
            
217

    
the appointment of a conservator, unless:
            
218

    
    (a)  there are separate guardianship proceedings pending before the court;
            
219

    
    (b)  the appointed conservator elects at the time to maintain the attorney's representation
            
220

    
of the protected person;
            
221

    
    (c)  there is a timely filed appeal of the appointment of the conservator or the
            
222

    
determination of the incapacity; or
            
223

    
    (d)  the court orders otherwise.

    (4)  If the alleged disability is mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or
            
225

    
disability, advanced age, chronic use of drugs, or chronic intoxication, the court may direct that
            
226

    
the person to be protected be examined by a physician designated by the court, preferably a
            
227

    
physician who is not connected with any institution in which the person is a patient or is
            
228

    
detained. The court may send a visitor to interview the person to be protected. The visitor may
            
229

    
be a guardian ad litem or an officer or employee of the court.
            
230

    
    [(3)] (5)  After hearing, upon finding that a basis for the appointment of a conservator
            
231

    
or other protective order has been established, the court shall make an appointment or other
            
232

    
appropriate protective order.

241

    
    (b)  After hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other
            
242

    
protective order exists with respect to a minor without other disability, the court has all those
            
243

    (c)  After hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other
            
246

    
protective order exists with respect to a person for reasons other than minority, the court has,
            
247

    
for the benefit of the person and members of the person's household, all the powers over the
            
248

    (ix)  renounce any interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer.
            
266

    
    (d)  The court may exercise, or direct the exercise of, its authority to exercise or release

Section

422

    
     75-5-425.  Distributive duties and powers of conservator.
            
423

    
    (1)  A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without
            
424

    
court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected
            
425

    
person and his dependents in accordance with the following principles:
            
426

    
    (a)  The conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard
            
427

    
of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any.
            
428

    
He may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing
            
429

    
support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent
            
430

    
or guardian of the protected person unless he knows that the parent or guardian is deriving

            
431


    
personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or
            
432

    
unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person.
            
433

    
    (b)  The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the
            
434

    
support, education, care or benefit of the protected person with due regard to:
            
435

    
    (i)  the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship and the likelihood
            
436

    
that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected
            
437

    
person's affairs and the estate which has been conserved for the protected person;
            
438

    
    (ii)  the accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the
            
439

    
protected person's household; and
            
440

    
    (iii)  other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.
            
441

    
    (c)  The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally
            
442

    
dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person's
            
443

    
household who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support.
            
444

    
    (d)  Funds expended under this Subsection (1) may be paid by the conservator to any
            
445

    
person, including the protected person to reimburse for expenditures which the conservator
            
446

    
might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is
            
447

    
reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or
            
448

    
reasonably necessary under the circumstances.
            
449

    
    (2)  If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions
            
450

    
authorized by Subsection (1), a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power
            
451

    
to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to
            
452

    
make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year 20% of the income from the estate.
            
453

    
    (3)  When a person who is a minor and who has not been adjudged to have a disability
            
454

    
under Subsection 

75-5-401

(2)(a) attains the age of majority, the person's conservator, after
            
455

    
meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds
            
456

    
and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
            
457

    
    (4)  When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person's disability (other than
            
458

    
minority) has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of
            
459

    
administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected
            
460

    
person as soon as possible.
            
461

    
    (5)  If a protected person dies, the conservator:

            
462


    
    (a)  shall:
            
463

    
    (i)  deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person that
            
464

    
may have come into the conservator's possession[,];
            
465

    
    (ii)  inform the executor or a beneficiary named in the will that the conservator has done
            
466

    
so[,]; and
            
467

    
    (iii)  retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the
            
468

    
decedent or other persons entitled to it[.  If after 40 days from the death of the protected person
            
469

    
no other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for
            
470

    
appointment is before the court, the conservator];
            
471

    
    (b)  may continue to pay the obligations lawfully due against the estate and to protect
            
472

    
the estate from waste, injury, or damages that might reasonably be foreseeable; and
            
473

    
    (c)  may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that the
            
474

    
conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent's estate without additional or
            
475

    
further appointment, provided that at least 40 days from the death of the protected person no
            
476

    
other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for
            
477

    
appointment is before the court.
            
478

    
    (6)  Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a
            
479

    
conservator[,] as provided in Subsection (5)(c) and after notice as provided in Section
            
480

    

75-3-310

, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no
            
481

    
objection and endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is
            
482

    
deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal
            
483

    
representative.  The making and entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an
            
484

    
order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in Section 

75-3-308

 and Chapter
            
485

486

    
may be distributed to the decedent's successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as
            
487

    
personal representative.
            
488

    
    Section 15.  
Section  
75-5-501

525
