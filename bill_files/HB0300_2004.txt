civil judgment, including restitution as provided in Section 

77-27-6

.
            
63

power to grant respite or reprieves in all cases of convictions for offenses against the state,
            
65

67

75

    
made or are prepared to make restitution as ascertained in accordance with the standards and
            
76

    
procedures of Section

77

    
forfeitures, or commutation or termination of sentence.

, and

82

    
     77-27-6.  Payment of restitution.
            
83

    
    (1)  When the Board of Pardons and Parole orders the release on parole of an inmate
            
84

    
who has been sentenced to make restitution pursuant to Title 77, Chapter 38a, Crime Victims
            
85

    
Restitution Act, or whom the board has ordered to make restitution, and all or a portion of
            
86

    
restitution is still owing, the board may establish a schedule, including both complete and
            
87

    
court-ordered restitution, by which payment of the restitution shall be made, or order
            
88

    
compensatory or other service in lieu of or in combination with restitution. In fixing the
            
89

    
schedule and supervising the paroled offender's performance, the board may consider the

            
90


    
factors specified in Section 

77-38a-302

.
            
91

92

    
make restitution in an amount not to exceed the pecuniary damages to the victim of the offense
            
93

    
of which the defendant has been convicted, the victim of any other criminal conduct admitted
            
94

    
to by the defendant to the sentencing court, or for conduct for which the defendant has agreed
            
95

    
to make restitution as part of a plea agreement,] unless the board applying the criteria as set
            
96

    
forth in Section 

77-38a-302

 determines that restitution is inappropriate.
            
97

    
    (b)  Any restitution order must be executed prior to the termination of a sentence and
            
98

    
parole.
            
99

    
    (3)  The board may also make orders of restitution for recovery of any or all costs
            
100

101

    
defendant's needs or conduct.
            
102

    
    (4)  If the defendant, upon termination of the parole period owes outstanding fines,
            
103

    
restitution, or other assessed costs not already addressed by the court under Section

105

    
Board of Pardons and Parole shall [forward a restitution order to the sentencing court to be
            
106

    
entered on the judgment docket.  The entry shall constitute a lien and is subject to the same
            
107

    
rules as a judgment for money in a civil judgment] send notice to the court that a civil
            
108

    
collection order needs to be addressed under Section 

77-38a-401

 prior to the termination of a
            
109

    
sentence and parole.
