the recovery of the part could interfere with the postmortem investigation into the decedent's
            
687

    
cause or manner of death, the medical examiner shall consult with the procurement
            
688

696

    
recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the medical examiner or designee
            
697

    
reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent's cause or
            
698

who removes the part to provide the medical examiner with a record describing the condition
            
707

    
of the part, a biopsy, a photograph, and any other information and observations that would
