 This act modifies provisions relating to Special Districts and Limited Purpose Local
            

    
 Government Entities to rewrite and standardize annexation and dissolution provisions for
            

    
 specified special districts and for local districts.  This act allows for the process to annex an
            

    
 area outside the boundaries of a specified special district or a local district to be initiated by
            

    
 petition or by resolution of a county or municipal legislative body.  The act allows, in some
            

    
 circumstances, a county or municipality to terminate the annexation process if the county
            

    
 or municipality will provide the service proposed to be provided by the special or local
            

    
 district.  The act requires, with some exceptions, the special or local district to hold a public
            

    
 hearing and provide notice of the hearing and provides for a protest and election, under
            

    
 certain circumstances.  The act provides for a streamlined annexation process for a district
            

    
 providing service on a wholesale level and for a district providing transportation service. 
            

    
 The act provides a procedure for districts to adjust a common boundary.  The act provides
            

    
 a procedure for dissolving a district if certain conditions are present.  The act provides for
            

    
 notice and a public hearing for a dissolution.  The act repeals inconsistent and obsolete
            

    
 provisions and makes technical changes.  This act provides a coordination clause.
