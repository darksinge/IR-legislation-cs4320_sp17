 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-5-04  12:33 PM


This bill requires all nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers to pay an equity assessment fee on
cigarettes sold in this state. This assessment is in addition to the state's escrow requirements for
nonparticipating manufacturers. The application of the assessment to nonparticipating
manufacturers only may violate the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause of the
14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The statute may withstand an equal protection and
due process challenge if the court determines that the Legislature's treatment of
nonparticipating manufacturers is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
