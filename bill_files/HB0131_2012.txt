    (1) The board may hold a hearing to consider the need for the operation as a unit of one
            
2525

    
or more pools or parts of them in a field.
            
2526

    
    (2)  The board shall make an order providing for the unit operation of a pool or part of
            
2527

    
it, if the board finds that:
            
2528

    
    (a)  Such operation is reasonably necessary for the purposes of this chapter; and
            
2529

    
    (b)  The value of the estimated additional recovery of oil or gas substantially exceeds
            
2530

    
the estimated additional cost incident to conducting such operations.
            
2531

    
    (3)  The order shall prescribe a plan for unit operations that shall include:
            
2532

    
    (a)  a description of the lands and of the pool or pools or parts of them to be so
            
2533

    
operated, termed the unit area;
            
2534

    
    (b)  a statement of the nature of the operations contemplated;
            
2535

    
    (c)  an allocation to the separately owned tracts in the unit area of all the oil and gas that
            
2536

    
is produced from the unit area and is saved, being the production that is not used in the conduct
            
2537

    
of operations on the unit area or not unavoidably lost. The allocation shall be in accord with the
            
2538

    
agreement, if any, of the interested parties. If there is no such agreement, the board shall

            
2539


    
determine the relative value, from evidence introduced at the hearing of the separately owned
            
2540

    
tracts in the unit area, exclusive of physical equipment, for development of oil and gas by unit
            
2541

    
operations, and the production allocated to each tract shall be the proportion that the relative
            
2542

    
value of each tract so determined bears to the relative value of all tracts in the unit area;
            
2543

    
    (d)  a provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area (not including royalty
            
2544

    
owners) of their respective investment in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials,
            
2545

    
equipment, and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations. The
            
2546

    
amount to be charged unit operations for any such item shall be determined by the owners of
            
2547

    
the unit area (not including royalty owners); but if the owners of the unit area are unable to
            
2548

    
agree upon the amount or correctness, the board shall determine them. The net amount charged
            
2549

    
against the owner of an interest in a separately owned tract shall be considered expense of unit
            
2550

    
operation chargeable against his interest in the tract. The adjustments provided for may be
            
2551

    
treated separately and handled by agreements separate from the unitization agreement;
            
2552

    
    (e)  a provision providing how the costs of unit operations, including capital
            
2553

    
investments, shall be determined and charged to the separately owned tracts and how these
            
2554

    
costs shall be paid, including a provision providing a procedure for the unit production
            
2555

    
allocated to an owner who does not pay the share of the cost of unit operations charged to such
            
2556

    
owner, or the interest of such owner, to be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of
            
2557

    
such costs. The operator of the unit shall have a first and prior lien for costs incurred pursuant
            
2558

    
to the plan of unitization upon each owner's oil and gas rights and his share of unitized
            
2559

    
production to secure the payment of such owner's proportionate part of the cost of developing
            
2560

2563

    
deemed to have contracted with the unit operator for his proportionate part of the cost of

    (g)  a provision for the supervision and conduct of the unit operations, in respect to

2581

    
approved in writing by those owners who, under the board's order, will be required to pay 70%
            
2582

    
of the costs of the unit operation, and also by the owners of 70% of the production or proceeds
            
2583

    
that will be credited to interests which are free of cost, such as royalties, overriding royalties,
            
2584

    
and production payments, and the board has made a finding, either in the order providing for
            
2585

    
unit operations or in a supplemental order, that the plan for unit operations has been so
            
2586

    
approved. If the persons owning required percentage of interest in that unit area do not approve
            
2587

    
the plan for unit operations within a period of six months from the date on which the order
            
2588

    
providing for unit operations is made, the order shall be ineffective and shall be revoked by the

    (5)  An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order made by the
            
2591

    
board in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order providing for
            
2592

    
unit operations, provided:
            
2593

    
    (a)  If such an amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the
            
2594

    
approval of the amendment by the owners of royalty, overriding royalty, production payments
            
2595

    
and other such interests which are free of costs shall not be required.

    (b)  No such order of amendment shall change the percentage for the allocation of oil

2599

    
order.
            
2600

    
    (6)  The board, by an order, may provide for the unit operation of a pool or pools or

            
2601


    
parts thereof that embrace a unit area established by a previous order of the division. The order,
            
2602

    
in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat the unit area previously
            
2603

    
established as a single tract, and the portion of the unit production allocated shall then be
            
2604

    
allocated among the separately owned tracts included in the previously established unit area in
            
2605

    
the same proportions of those specified in the previous order.
            
2606

    
    (7)  An order may provide for unit operations on less than the whole of a pool where the
            
2607

    
unit area is of such size and shape as may be reasonably required for that purpose, and the
            
2608

    
conduct will have no adverse effect upon other portions of the pool.
            
2609

    
    (8)  All operations, including, but not limited to, the commencement, drilling, or
            
2610

    
operation of a well upon any portion of the unit area shall be deemed for all purposes the
            
2611

    
conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit area by the several
            
2612

    
owners. The portions of the unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area
            
2613

    
shall, when produced, be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such
            
2614

    
tract by a well drilled. Operations conducted pursuant to an order of the board providing for
            
2615

    
unit operations shall constitute a fulfillment of all the express or implied obligations for each
            
2616

    
lease or contract covering lands in the unit area to the extent that compliance with such
            
2617

    
obligations cannot be had because of the order of the board.
            
2618

    
    (9)  The portion of the unit production allocated to any tract, and the proceeds from the
            
2619

    
sale, shall be the property and income of the several owners, subject to the rights of royalty
            
2620

    
owners, to whom, or to whose credit, they are allocated or payable under the order providing
            
2621

    
for unit operations.
            
2622

    
    (10)  No division order or other contract relating to the sale or purchase of production
            
2623

    
from a separately owned tract shall be terminated by the order providing for unit operations but
            
2624

    
shall remain in force and apply to oil and gas allocated to such tract until terminated in
            
2625

    
accordance with the provisions thereof.
            
2626

    
    (11)  Except to the extent that the parties affected agree and as provided in [(e) of]
            
2627

    
Subsection (3)(e) [of this section], no order providing for unit operations shall be construed to
            
2628

    
result in a transfer of all or any part of the title of any person to the oil and gas rights in any
            
2629

    
tract in the unit area. All property, whether real or personal, that may be acquired in the
            
2630

    
conduct of unit operations hereunder shall be acquired for the account of the owners within the
            
2631

    
unit area and shall be the property of the owners in the proportion that the expenses of unit

            
2632


    
operations are charged, unless otherwise provided in the plan of unit operation.
            
2633

    
    (12)  This section shall apply only to field or pool units and shall not apply to the

conditions that are just and reasonable and satisfy the requirements of Subsection (2).
            
2761

    
    (4)  An order by the division for unit operations shall prescribe a plan, including:
            
2762

    
    (a)  a description of the geothermal area to be unit operated, termed the unit area;
            
2763

    
    (b)  a statement of the nature of the operations contemplated, the time they will
            
2764

    
commence, and the manner and circumstances under which unit operations shall terminate;
            
2765

    
    (c)  an allocation to the separately-owned tracts in the unit area of the geothermal
            
2766

    
resources produced and of the costs incurred in unit operations. The allocations shall be in
            
2767

    
accord with the agreement, if any, of the affected parties.  If there is no agreement, the division
            
2768

    
shall determine the allocations from evidence introduced at a hearing before the division.
            
2769

    
Production shall be allocated in proportion to the relative value that each tract bears to the
            
2770

    
value of all tracts in the unit area.  The acreage of each tract in proportion to the total unit
            
2771

    
acreage shall be the measure of relative value, unless the division finds after public hearing that
            
2772

    
another method is likely to result in a more equitable allocation and protection of correlative
            
2773

    
rights.  Resource temperature, pressure, fluid quality, geological conditions, distance to place
            
2774

    
of use, and productivity are among the factors that may be considered in evaluating other
            
2775

    
methods.  The method for allocating production in unit operations shall be revised, if, after a
            
2776

    
hearing, the division finds that the revised method is likely to result in a more equitable
            
2777

    
allocation and protection of correlative rights.   Any affected person may file a request for
            
2778

    
agency action to consider adoption of a revised allocation method, but the request may not be
            
2779

    
made until three years after the initial order by the division or at less than two-year intervals
            
2780

    
after that.  Upon receipt of a request for consideration of a revised allocation method, the
            
2781

    
division shall hold a hearing;
            
2782

    
    (d)  a provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area (not including royalty
            
2783

    
owners) of their respective investment in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials,
            
2784

    
equipment, and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations.  The
            
2785

    
amount to be charged unit operations for each item shall be determined by the owners of the
            
2786

    
unit area (not including royalty owners).  If the owners of the unit area are unable to agree upon

            
2787


    
the amount of the charges or to agree upon the correctness of the charges, any affected party
            
2788

    
may file a request for agency action.  Upon receipt of the request, the division shall hold a
            
2789

    
hearing to determine them.  The net amount charged against the owner of a separately-owned
            
2790

    
tract shall be considered an expense of unit operation chargeable against that tract.  The
            
2791

    
adjustments provided for in this subsection may be treated separately and handled by
            
2792

    
agreements separate from the unitization agreement;
            
2793

    
    (e)  a provision providing how the costs of unit operations, including capital
            
2794

    
investments, shall be determined and charged to the separately-owned tracts and how these
            
2795

    
costs shall be paid, including a provision providing when, how, and by whom the unit
            
2796

    
production allocated to an owner who does not pay the share of the cost of unit operation
            
2797

    
charged to that owner, or the interest of that owner, may be sold and the proceeds applied to the
            
2798

    
payment of the costs.  The operator of the unit shall have a first and prior lien for costs incurred
            
2799

    
pursuant to the plan of unitization upon each owner's geothermal rights and his share of
            
2800

    
unitized production to secure the payment of the owner's proportionate part of the cost of
            
2801

    
developing and operating the unit area.  This lien may be [established and] enforced in the
            
2802

    
same manner as provided by [Sections

Enforcement of Preconstruction and Construction Liens.  For these purposes any
            
2804

    
nonconsenting owner is considered to have contracted with the unit operator for his
            
2805

    
proportionate part of the cost of developing and operating the unit area. A transfer or
            
2806

    
conversion of any owner's interest or any portion of it, however accomplished, after the
            
2807

    
effective date of the order creating the unit, does not relieve the transferred interest of the
            
2808

    
operator's lien on the interest for the cost and expense of unit operations;
            
2809

    
    (f)  a provision, if necessary, for carrying or otherwise financing any person who elects
            
2810

    
to be carried or otherwise financed, allowing a reasonable interest charge for this service
            
2811

    
payable out of that person's share of the production;
            
2812

    
    (g)  a provision for the supervision and conduct of the unit operations, in respect to
            
2813

    
which each person shall have a vote with a value corresponding to the percentage of the costs
            
2814

    
of unit operations chargeable against the interest of that person;
            
2815

    
    (h)  any additional provisions that are necessary to carry on the unit operations.
            
2816

    
    (5) (a)  No order of the division providing for unit operations is effective unless and
            
2817

    
until the division finds that the plan for unit operations prescribed by the division has been

            
2818


    
approved in writing by:
            
2819

    
    (i)  those persons, who under the division's order, will be required to pay 66% of the
            
2820

    
costs of the unit operation; and
            
2821

    
    (ii)  the owners of 66% of the production or proceeds of the unit operation that are free
            
2822

    
of costs, such as royalties, overriding royalties, and production payments.
            
2823

    
    (b)  If the persons owning the required percentage of interest in the unit area do not
            
2824

    
approve the plan within six months from the date on which the order is made, the order is
            
2825

    
ineffective and shall be revoked by the division unless for good cause shown the division
            
2826

    
extends this time.
            
2827

    
    (6) (a)  An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order of the
            
2828

    
division in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order for unit
            
2829

    
operations.
            
2830

    
    (b)  If this amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the approval

2832

    
interests that are free of costs is required.
            
2833

    
    (c)  Production allocation may be amended only by following the procedures of
            
2834

    
Subsection (4)(c).
            
2835

    
    (7) (a)  All operations, including the commencement, drilling, or operation of a well
            
2836

    
upon any portion of the unit area are considered for all purposes to be the conduct of those
            
2837

    
operations upon each separately-owned tract in the unit by the several owners of tracts in the

    (b)  The portions of the unit production allocated to a separately-owned tract in a unit
            
2840

    
area are, when produced, considered for all purposes to have been actually produced from that
            
2841

    
tract by a well drilled on it.  Good faith operations conducted pursuant to an order of the
            
2842

    
division providing for unit operations constitutes a complete defense to any suit alleging breach
            
2843

    
of lease or of contractual obligations covering lands in the unit area to the extent that
            
2844

    
compliance with these obligations cannot be had because of the order of the division.
            
2845

    
    (8)  The portion of the unit production allocated to any tract, and the proceeds from the
            
2846

    
sale of this production, are the property and income of the several persons to whom, or to
            
2847

    
whose credit, they are allocated or payable under the order providing for unit operations.

    (9) (a)  Except to the extent that the parties affected so agree, and as provided in

            
2849

transfer of all or any part of the title of any person to the geothermal resource rights in any tract
            
2851
