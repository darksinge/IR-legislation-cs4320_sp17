Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
32

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
78B-9-402

 is amended to read:
            
33

    
     78B-9-402.  Petition for determination of factual innocence -- Sufficient
            
34

    
 allegations -- Notification of victim.
            
35

    
    (1)  A person who has been convicted of a felony offense may petition the district court
            
36

    
in the county in which the person was convicted for a hearing to establish that the person is
            
37

    
factually innocent of the crime or crimes of which the person was convicted.
            
38

    
    (2) (a)  The petition shall contain an assertion of factual innocence under oath by the
            
39

    
petitioner, and shall aver, with supporting affidavits or other credible documents, that:
            
40

    
    (i)  newly discovered material evidence exists that, if credible, establishes that the
            
41

    
petitioner is factually innocent;
            
42

    
    (ii) the specific evidence identified by the petitioner in the petition establishes
            
43

    
innocence;
            
44

    
    (iii)  the material evidence is not merely cumulative of evidence that was known;
            
45

    
    (iv)  the material evidence is not merely impeachment evidence; and
            
46

    
    (v)  viewed with all the other evidence, the newly discovered evidence demonstrates
            
47

    
that the petitioner is factually innocent.
            
48

    
    (b)  The court shall review the petition in accordance with the procedures in Subsection
            
49

    
(9)(b), and make a finding that the petition has satisfied the requirements of Subsection (2)(a). 
            
50

    
If the court finds the petition does not meet all the requirements of Subsection (2)(a), it shall
            
51

    
dismiss the petition without prejudice and send notice of the dismissal to the petitioner and the
            
52

    
attorney general.
            
53

    
    (3) (a)  The petition shall also contain an averment that:
            
54

    
    (i)  neither the petitioner nor petitioner's counsel knew of the evidence at the time of
            
55

    
trial or sentencing or in time to include the evidence in any previously filed post-trial motion or
            
56

    
postconviction motion, and the evidence could not have been discovered by the petitioner or
            
57

    
the petitioner's counsel through the exercise of reasonable diligence; or
            
58

    
    (ii)  a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to exercise reasonable

            
59


    
diligence in uncovering the evidence.
            
60

    
    (b)  Upon entry of a finding that the petition is sufficient under Subsection (2)(a), the
            
61

    
court shall then review the petition to determine if Subsection (3)(a) has been satisfied.  If the
            
62

    
court finds that the requirements of Subsection (3)(a) have not been satisfied, it may dismiss
            
63

    
the petition without prejudice and give notice to the petitioner and the attorney general of the
            
64

    
dismissal, or the court may enter a finding that based upon the strength of the petition, the
            
65

    
requirements of Subsection (3)(a) are waived in the interest of justice.
            
66

    
    (4)  If the conviction for which the petitioner asserts factual innocence was based upon
            
67

    
a plea of guilty, the petition shall contain the specific nature and content of the evidence that
            
68

    
establishes factual innocence.  The court shall review the evidence and may dismiss the petition
            
69

    
at any time in the course of the proceedings, if the court finds that the evidence of factual
            
70

    
innocence relies solely upon the recantation of testimony or prior statements made by a witness
            
71

    
against the petitioner, and the recantation appears to the court to be equivocal or self-serving.
            
72

    
    (5)  A person who has already obtained postconviction relief that vacated or reversed
            
73

    
the person's conviction or sentence may also file a petition under this part in the same manner
            
74

    
and form as described above, if no retrial or appeal regarding this offense is pending.
            
75

    
    (6)  If some or all of the evidence alleged to be exonerating is biological evidence
            
76

    
subject to DNA testing, the petitioner shall seek DNA testing pursuant to Section 

78B-9-301

.
            
77

    
    (7)  Except as provided in Subsection (9), the petition and all subsequent proceedings
            
78

    
shall be in compliance with and governed by Rule 65C, Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, and
            
79

    
shall include the underlying criminal case number.
            
80

    
    (8)  After a petition is filed under this section, prosecutors, law enforcement officers,
            
81

    
and crime laboratory personnel shall cooperate in preserving evidence and in determining the
            
82

    
sufficiency of the chain of custody of the evidence which is the subject of the petition.
            
83

    
    (9) (a)  A person who files a petition under this section shall serve notice of the petition
            
84

    
and a copy of the petition upon the office of the prosecutor who obtained the conviction and
            
85

    
upon the Utah attorney general.
            
86

    
    (b)  The assigned judge shall conduct an initial review of the petition.  If it is apparent
            
87

    
to the court that the petitioner is either merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence presented in
            
88

    
previous proceedings or presenting issues that appear frivolous or speculative on their face, the
            
89

    
court shall dismiss the petition, state the basis for the dismissal, and serve notice of dismissal

            
90


    
upon the petitioner and the attorney general.  If, upon completion of the initial review, the court
            
91

    
does not dismiss the petition, it shall order the attorney general to file a response to the petition. 
            
92

    
The attorney general shall, within 30 days after receipt of the court's order, or within any
            
93

    
additional period of time the court allows, answer or otherwise respond to all proceedings
            
94

    
initiated under this part.
            
95

    
    (c)  After the time for response by the attorney general under Subsection (9)(b) has
            
96

    
passed, the court shall order a hearing if it finds the petition meets the requirements of
            
97

    
Subsections (2) and (3) and finds there is a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence
            
98

    
regarding the charges of which the petitioner was convicted.  No bona fide and compelling
            
99

    
issue of factual innocence exists if the petitioner is merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence
            
100

    
presented in a previous proceeding or if the petitioner is unable to identify with sufficient
            
101

    
specificity the nature and reliability of the newly discovered evidence that establishes the
            
102

    
petitioner's factual innocence.
            
103

    
    (d)  If the parties stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually
            
104

    
innocent, the court may find the petitioner is factually innocent without holding a hearing.  If
            
105

    
the state will not stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually innocent,
            
106

    
no determination of factual innocence may be made by the court without first holding a hearing
            
107

    
under this part.
            
108

    
    (10)  The court may not grant a petition for a hearing under this part during the period
            
109

    
in which criminal proceedings in the matter are pending before any trial or appellate court,
            
110

    
unless stipulated to by the parties.
            
111

    
    (11)  Any victim of a crime that is the subject of a petition under this part, and who has
            
112

    
elected to receive notice under Section 

77-38-3

, shall be notified by the state's attorney of any
            
113

    
hearing regarding the petition.
            
114

    
    (12)  A petition to determine factual innocence under this part, or Part 3, Postconviction 
            
115

    
Testing of DNA, shall be filed separately from any petition for postconviction relief under Part
            
116

    
1, General Provisions.  Separate petitions may be filed simultaneously in the same court.
            
117

    
    (13)  The procedures governing the filing and adjudication of a petition to determine
            
118

    
factual innocence apply to all petitions currently filed or pending and any new petitions filed on
            
119

    
or after [the effective date of this amendment] March 25, 2010.
            
120

    
    (14)  A claim for determination of factual innocence under this part is extinguished

            
121


    
upon the death of the petitioner.
            
122

    
    Section 2.  
Section  
78B-9-404

 is amended to read:
            
123

    
     78B-9-404.  Hearing upon petition -- Procedures -- Court determination of factual
            
124

    
 innocence.
            
125

    
    (1) (a)  In any hearing conducted under this part, the Utah attorney general shall
            
126

    
represent the state.
            
127

    
    (b)  The burden is upon the petitioner to establish the petitioner's factual innocence by
            
128

    
clear and convincing evidence.
            
129

    
    (2)  The court may consider:
            
130

    
    (a)  evidence that was suppressed or would be suppressed at a criminal trial; and
            
131

    
    (b)  hearsay evidence, and may consider that the evidence is hearsay in evaluating its
            
132

    
weight and credibility.
            
133

    
    (3)  In making its determination the court shall consider, in addition to the evidence
            
134

    
presented at the hearing under this part, the record of the original criminal case and at any
            
135

    
postconviction proceedings in the case.
            
136

    
    (4)  If the court, after considering all the evidence, determines by clear and convincing
            
137

    
evidence that the petitioner:
            
138

    
    (a)  is factually innocent of one or more offenses of which the petitioner was convicted,
            
139

    
the court shall order that those convictions:
            
140

    
    (i)  be vacated with prejudice; and
            
141

    
    (ii)  be expunged from the petitioner's record; or
            
142

    
    (b)  did not commit one or more offenses of which the petitioner was convicted, but the
            
143

    
court does not find by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner did not commit any
            
144

    
lesser included offenses relating to those offenses, the court shall modify the original
            
145

    
conviction and sentence of the petitioner as appropriate for the lesser included offense, whether
            
146

    
or not the lesser included offense was originally submitted to the trier of fact.
            
147

    
    (5) (a)  If the court, after considering all the evidence, does not determine by clear and
            
148

    
convincing evidence that the petitioner is factually innocent of the offense or offenses the
            
149

    
petitioner is challenging and does not find that Subsection (4)(b) applies, the court shall deny
            
150

    
the petition regarding the offense or offenses.
            
151

    
    (b)  If the court finds that the petition was brought in bad faith, it shall enter the finding

            
152


    
on the record, and the petitioner may not file a second or successive petition under this section
            
153

    
without first applying to and obtaining permission from the court which denied the prior
            
154

    
petition.
            
155

    
    (6)  At least 30 days prior to a hearing on a petition to determine factual innocence, the
            
156

    
petitioner and the respondent shall exchange information regarding the evidence each intends
            
157

    
to present at the hearing.  This information shall include:
            
158

    
    (a)  a list of witnesses to be called at the hearing; and
            
159

    
    (b)  a summary of the testimony or other evidence to be introduced through each
            
160

    
witness, including any expert witnesses.
            
161

    
    (7)  Each party is entitled to a copy of any expert report to be introduced or relied upon
            
162

    
by that expert or another expert at least 30 days prior to hearing.
            
163

    
    (8)  The court, after considering all the evidence, may not find the petitioner to be
            
164

    
factually innocent unless:
            
165

    
    (a)  the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner did not
            
166

    
commit one or more of the offenses of which the petitioner was convicted, as defined in
            
167

    
Subsection 

78B-9-401.5

(2); and
            
168

    
    (b)  the determination is based upon the newly discovered material evidence described
            
169

    
in the petition, pursuant to Subsection 

78B-9-402

(2)(a), and as defined in Subsection
            
170

    


78B-9-401.5

(3).

     78B-9-405.  Judgment and assistance payment.
            
173

    
    (1) (a)  If a court finds a petitioner factually innocent under [Title 78B, Chapter 9,] Part
            
174

    
3, Postconviction Testing of DNA, or under this part, and if the petitioner has served a period

177

    
15 years, the monetary equivalent of the average annual nonagricultural payroll wage in Utah,
            
178

    
as determined by the data most recently published by the Department of Workforce Services at
            
179

    
the time of the petitioner's release from prison.
            
180

    
    (b)  As used in this Subsection (1), "petitioner" means a United States citizen or an
            
181

    (2)  Payments pursuant to this section shall be made as follows:
            
184

    (5)  Payments pursuant to this section:
            
230

    
    (a)  are not subject to any Utah state taxes; and

    (b)  may not be offset by any expenses incurred by the state or any political subdivision
            
232

    
of the state, including expenses incurred to secure the petitioner's custody, or to feed, clothe, or
            
233

    
provide medical services for the petitioner.
            
234

    (b)  provide a letter to the petitioner explaining that the petitioner's conviction has been
            
239

    
vacated on the grounds of factual innocence and indicating that the petitioner did not commit
            
240

    
the crime or crimes for which the petitioner was convicted and was later found to be factually
            
241

    
innocent under [Title 78B, Chapter 9,] Part 3, Postconviction Testing of DNA, or this part.
            
242

243

    
Postconviction Testing of DNA, or this part shall have access to the same services and
            
244

    
programs available to Utah citizens generally as though the conviction for which the petitioner

            
245


    
was found to be factually innocent had never occurred.
            
246

    
    (8)  Payments pursuant to this part constitute a full and conclusive resolution of the
            
247

    
petitioner's claims on the specific issue of factual innocence.  Pre-judgment interest may not be
            
248

    
awarded in addition to the payments provided under this part.
