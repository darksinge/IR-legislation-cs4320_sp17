Section 58-67b-101 is enacted to read:63     CHAPTER 67b.  INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT64          58-67b-101. Title.65          This chapter is known as the "Interstate Medical Licensure Compact."66          Section 2.  Section 58-67b-102 is enacted to read:67          58-67b-102. Section 1 -- Purpose.68          In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the69     delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have70     allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing71     licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process72     that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability73     of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients.  The Compact creates another pathway74     for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act.  The75     Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of76     medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and77     therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where78     the patient is located.  State medical boards that participate in the Compact retain the79     jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state80     issued to a physician through the procedures in the Compact.81          Section 3.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the460     event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond461     the scope of the purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action462     by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.463          (2)  Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate Commission shall be464     made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Revised Model State465     Administrative Procedure Act" of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.466          (3)  Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for467     judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the468     federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, provided that the469     filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective470     unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success.  The court shall471     give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and472     shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority473     granted to the Interstate Commission.474          Section 17.

The relief sought may497     include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the498     prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney fees.499          (3)  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate500     Commission.  The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available501     under state law or the regulation of a profession.502          Section 19.

The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting513     state must cure its default; and514          (b)  provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.515          (3)  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be516     terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners and517     all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the Compact shall terminate on the effective518     date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or519     liabilities incurred during the period of the default.520          (4)  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other521     means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to terminate shall be522     given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the523     defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.524          (5)  The Interstate Commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses525     and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state, or the526     withdrawal of a member state.527          (6)  The member state which has been terminated is responsible for all dues,528     obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including529     obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.530          (7)  The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has531     been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless otherwise532     mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.533          (8)  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by534     petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district535     where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be536     awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney fees.537          Section 20.  Section 58-67b-120 is enacted to read:538          58-67b-120.

Thereafter, it shall become effective and549     binding on a state upon enactment of the Compact into law by that state.550          (3)  The governors of non-member states, or their designees, shall be invited to551     participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a non-voting basis prior to adoption552     of the Compact by all states.553          (4)  The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the Compact for554     enactment by the member states.  No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the555     Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by556     unanimous consent of the member states.557          Section 22.
