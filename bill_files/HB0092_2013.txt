AMENDS:
            
24

    
     78B-9-402, as last amended by Laws of Utah 2012, Chapter 220
            
25

    

            
26

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
27

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
78B-9-402

 is amended to read:

            
28


    
     78B-9-402.  Petition for determination of factual innocence -- Sufficient
            
29

    
 allegations -- Notification of victim.
            
30

    
    (1)  A person who has been convicted of a felony offense may petition the district court
            
31

    
in the county in which the person was convicted for a hearing to establish that the person is
            
32

    
factually innocent of the crime or crimes of which the person was convicted.
            
33

    
    (2) (a)  The petition shall contain an assertion of factual innocence under oath by the
            
34

    
petitioner[,] and shall aver, with supporting affidavits or other credible documents, that:
            
35

    
    (i)  newly discovered material evidence exists that, if credible, establishes that the
            
36

    
petitioner is factually innocent;
            
37

    
    (ii) the specific evidence identified by the petitioner in the petition establishes
            
38

    
innocence;
            
39

    
    (iii)  the material evidence is not merely cumulative of evidence that was known;
            
40

    
    (iv)  the material evidence is not merely impeachment evidence; and
            
41

    
    (v)  viewed with all the other evidence, the newly discovered evidence demonstrates
            
42

    
that the petitioner is factually innocent.
            
43

    
    (b)  The court shall review the petition in accordance with the procedures in Subsection
            
44

    
(9)(b), and make a finding that the petition has satisfied the requirements of Subsection (2)(a). 
            
45

    
If the court finds the petition does not meet all the requirements of Subsection (2)(a), it shall
            
46

    
dismiss the petition without prejudice and send notice of the dismissal to the petitioner and the
            
47

    
attorney general.
            
48

    
    (3) (a)  The petition shall also contain an averment that:
            
49

    
    (i)  neither the petitioner nor the  petitioner's counsel knew of the evidence at the time
            
50

    
of trial or sentencing or in time to include the evidence in any previously filed post-trial motion
            
51

    
or postconviction motion, and the evidence could not have been discovered by the petitioner or
            
52

    
the petitioner's counsel through the exercise of reasonable diligence; or
            
53

    
    (ii)  a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to exercise reasonable
            
54

    
diligence in uncovering the evidence.
            
55

    
    (b)  Upon entry of a finding that the petition is sufficient under Subsection (2)(a), the
            
56

    
court shall then review the petition to determine if Subsection (3)(a) has been satisfied.  If the
            
57

    
court finds that the requirements of Subsection (3)(a) have not been satisfied, it may dismiss
            
58

    
the petition without prejudice and give notice to the petitioner and the attorney general of the

            
59


    
dismissal, or the court may waive the requirements of Subsection (3)(a) if the court finds the
            
60

    
petition should proceed to hearing based upon the strength of the petition, and that there is
            
61

    
other evidence that could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence by
            
62

    
the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel at trial, and the other evidence:
            
63

    
    (i)  was not discovered by the petitioner or the petitioner's counsel;
            
64

    
    (ii)  is material upon the issue of factual innocence; and
            
65

    
    (iii)  has never been presented to a court.
            
66

    
    (4)  If the conviction for which the petitioner asserts factual innocence was based upon
            
67

    
a plea of guilty, the petition shall contain the specific nature and content of the evidence that
            
68

    
establishes factual innocence.  The court shall review the evidence and may dismiss the petition
            
69

    
at any time in the course of the proceedings, if the court finds that the evidence of factual
            
70

    
innocence relies solely upon the recantation of testimony or prior statements made by a witness
            
71

    
against the petitioner, and the recantation appears to the court to be equivocal or selfserving.
            
72

    
    (5)  A person who has already obtained postconviction relief that vacated or reversed
            
73

    
the person's conviction or sentence may also file a petition under this part in the same manner
            
74

    
and form as described above, if no retrial or appeal regarding this offense is pending.
            
75

    
    (6)  If some or all of the evidence alleged to be exonerating is biological evidence
            
76

    
subject to DNA testing, the petitioner shall seek DNA testing pursuant to Section 

78B-9-301

.
            
77

    
    (7)  Except as provided in Subsection (9), the petition and all subsequent proceedings
            
78

    
shall be in compliance with and governed by Rule 65C, Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, and
            
79

    
shall include the underlying criminal case number.
            
80

    
    (8)  After a petition is filed under this section, prosecutors, law enforcement officers,
            
81

    
and crime laboratory personnel shall cooperate in preserving evidence and in determining the
            
82

    
sufficiency of the chain of custody of the evidence which is the subject of the petition.
            
83

    
    (9) (a)  A person who files a petition under this section shall serve notice of the petition
            
84

    
and a copy of the petition upon the office of the prosecutor who obtained the conviction and
            
85

    
upon the Utah attorney general.
            
86

    
    (b)  The assigned judge shall conduct an initial review of the petition.  If it is apparent
            
87

    
to the court that the petitioner is either merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence presented in
            
88

    
previous proceedings or presenting issues that appear frivolous or speculative on their face, the
            
89

    
court shall dismiss the petition, state the basis for the dismissal, and serve notice of dismissal

            
90


    
upon the petitioner and the attorney general.  If, upon completion of the initial review, the court
            
91

    
does not dismiss the petition, it shall order the attorney general to file a response to the petition. 
            
92

    
The attorney general shall, within 30 days after receipt of the court's order, or within any
            
93

    
additional period of time the court allows, answer or otherwise respond to all proceedings
            
94

    
initiated under this part.
            
95

    
    (c)  After the time for response by the attorney general under Subsection (9)(b) has
            
96

    
passed, the court shall order a hearing if it finds the petition meets the requirements of
            
97

    
Subsections (2) and (3) and finds there is a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence
            
98

    
regarding the charges of which the petitioner was convicted.  No bona fide and compelling
            
99

    
issue of factual innocence exists if the petitioner is merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence
            
100

    
presented in a previous proceeding or if the petitioner is unable to identify with sufficient
            
101

    
specificity the nature and reliability of the newly discovered evidence that establishes the
            
102

    
petitioner's factual innocence.
            
103

    
    (d)  If the parties stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually
            
104

    
innocent, the court may find the petitioner is factually innocent without holding a hearing.  If
            
105

    
the state will not stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually innocent,
            
106

    
no determination of factual innocence may be made by the court without first holding a hearing
            
107

    
under this part.
            
108

    
    (10)  The court may not grant a petition for a hearing under this part during the period
            
109

    
in which criminal proceedings in the matter are pending before any trial or appellate court,
            
110

    
unless stipulated to by the parties.
            
111

    
    (11)  Any victim of a crime that is the subject of a petition under this part, and who has
            
112

    
elected to receive notice under Section 

77-38-3

, shall be notified by the state's attorney of any
            
113

    
hearing regarding the petition.
            
114

    
    (12)  A petition to determine factual innocence under this part, or Part 3, Postconviction 
            
115

    
Testing of DNA, shall be filed separately from any petition for postconviction relief under Part
            
116

    
1, General Provisions.  Separate petitions may be filed simultaneously in the same court.
            
117

    
    (13)  The procedures governing the filing and adjudication of a petition to determine
            
118

    
factual innocence apply to all petitions currently filed or pending in the district court and any
            
119

    
new petitions filed on or after June 1, 2012.
            
120

    
    (14) (a)  As used in this Subsection (14), "spouse" means the legal relationship:

            
121


    
    (i)  established between a man and a woman as recognized by the laws of this state; and
            
122

    
    (ii)  existing at the time of the petitioner's death.
            
123

    
    (b)  A claim for determination of factual innocence under this part is not extinguished
            
124

    
upon the death of the petitioner.  [The assistance payment provisions of Section 

78B-9-405


            
125

    
may not apply, and financial payments may not be made, if]
            
126

    
    (c)  If any payments are already being made to the petitioner under this part at the time
            
127

    
of the death of the petitioner, or if the finding of factual innocence occurs after the death of the
            
128

    
petitioner[.  In addition, any payments already being made under Section 

78B-9-405

 shall cease
            
129

    
upon the death of the petitioner.], the payments due under Section 

78B-9-405

 shall be paid
            
130

    
according to the schedule under Section 

78B-9-405

 to the petitioner's surviving spouse.
            
131

    
Payments cease upon the death of the spouse.
            
132

    
    (15)  The spouse under Subsection (14) forfeits all rights to receive any payment under
            
133

    
this part if the spouse is charged with a homicide established by a preponderance of the
            
134

    
evidence that meets the elements of any felony homicide offense in Title 76, Chapter 5,
            
135

    
Offenses Against the Person, except automobile homicide, applying the same principles of
            
136

    
culpability and defenses as in Title 76, Utah Criminal Code, including Title 76, Chapter 2,
            
137

    
Principles of Criminal Responsibility.
