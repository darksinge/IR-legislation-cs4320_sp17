of taxable value.
            
407
    
    (b)  The same dollar amount guarantee per weighted pupil unit for the .0016 per dollar
            
408
    
of taxable value under Subsection (3)(a) shall apply to the board-approved leeway authorized
            
409
    
in Section 

53A-17a-134

, so that the guarantee shall apply up to a total of .002 per dollar of

    (b)  A majority vote opposing a modification does not deprive the district of authority to
            
427
    
continue an existing program.
            
428

429
    
school board levies, the board must allow the electors, in an election, to consider modifying or
            
430
