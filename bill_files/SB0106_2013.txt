    Section 1.  
Section  
35A-4-303

 is amended to read:
            
26

    
     35A-4-303.  Determination of contribution rates.
            
27

    
    (1) (a)  An employer's basic contribution rate is the same as the employer's benefit ratio
            
28

    
and is determined by dividing the total benefit costs charged back to an employer during the
            
29

    
immediately preceding four fiscal years by the total taxable wages of the employer for the same

            
30


    
time period, calculated to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction.
            
31

    
    (b)  In calculating the basic contribution rate under Subsection (1)(a), if four fiscal years
            
32

    
of data are not available:
            
33

    
    (i)  the data of the number of complete fiscal years that is available shall be divided by
            
34

    
the total taxable wages for the same time period; or
            
35

    
    (ii)  if the employer is a new employer, the basic contribution rate shall be determined
            
36

    
as described in Subsection (5).
            
37

    
    (2) (a)  Subject to Subsection (2)(b), the division shall determine the social contribution
            
38

    
rate by dividing all social costs as defined in Subsection 

35A-4-307

(1) applicable to the
            
39

    
preceding four fiscal years by the total taxable wages of all employers subject to contributions
            
40

    
for the same period, calculated to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction, and
            
41

    
rounding the result to three decimal places as follows:
            
42

    
    (i)  if the fourth decimal place is four or less, the third decimal place does not change;
            
43

    
or
            
44

    
    (ii)  if the fourth decimal place is five or more, rounding the third decimal place up.
            
45

    
    (b)  For calendar [year] years 2012 and 2013 only, if the calculation of the social
            
46

    
contribution rate under Subsection (2)(a) is greater than [.004] 0.004, the social contribution
            
47

    
rate for that calendar year [2012] is [.004] 0.004.
            
48

    
    (3) (a) The division shall set the reserve factor at a rate that sustains an adequate
            
49

    
reserve.
            
50

    
    (b)  For the purpose of setting the reserve factor:
            
51

    
    (i) the adequate reserve is defined as between 18 and 24 months of benefits at the
            
52

    
average of the five highest benefit cost rates in the last 25 years;
            
53

    
    (ii)  the division shall set the reserve factor at 1.0000 if the actual reserve fund balance
            
54

    
as of June 30 preceding the computation date is determined to be an adequate reserve;
            
55

    
    (iii)  the division shall set the reserve factor between 0.5000 and 1.0000 if the actual
            
56

    
reserve fund balance as of June 30 preceding the computation date is greater than the adequate
            
57

    
reserve;

            
58


    
    (iv)  the division shall set the reserve factor between 1.0000 and 1.5000 if the actual
            
59

    
reserve fund balance as of June 30 prior to the computation date is less than the adequate
            
60

    
reserve;
            
61

    
    (v)  if the actual reserve fund balance as of June 30 preceding the computation date is
            
62

    
insolvent or negative or if there is an outstanding loan from the Federal Unemployment
            
63

    
Account or other lending institution, the division shall set the reserve factor at 2.0000 until the
            
64

    
actual reserve fund balance as of June 30 preceding the computation date is determined by the
            
65

    
division to be solvent or positive and there is no outstanding loan;
            
66

    
    (vi)  the division shall set the reserve factor on or before January 1 of each year; and
            
67

    
    (vii)  money made available to the state under Section 903 of the Social Security Act,
            
68

    
42 U.S.C. 1103, as amended, which is received on or after January 1, 2004, may not be
            
69

    
considered in establishing the reserve factor under this section for the rate year 2005 or any
            
70

    
following rate year.
            
71

    
    (4) (a)  Beginning January 1, 2009, an employer's overall contribution rate is:
            
72

    
    (i)  except as provided in Subsection (4)(a)(ii) or (iii), the employer's basic contribution
            
73

    
rate multiplied by the reserve factor established under Subsection (3)(b), calculated to four
            
74

    
decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction, plus the social contribution rate
            
75

    
established under Subsection (2), and the result calculated to three decimal places, disregarding
            
76

    
any remaining fraction;
            
77

    
    (ii)  if under Subsection (4)(a)(i), the overall contribution rate calculation for an
            
78

    
employer is greater than 9% plus the applicable social contribution rate, the overall
            
79

    
contribution rate for the employer shall be reduced to 9% plus the applicable social
            
80

    
contribution rate; or
            
81

    
    (iii)  if under Subsection (4)(a)(i), the overall contribution rate calculation for a new
            
82

    
employer is less than 1.1%, the overall contribution rate for the new employer shall be
            
83

    
increased to 1.1%.
            
84

    
    (b)  Beginning January 1, 2012, an employer's overall contribution rate is:
            
85

    
    (i)  except as provided in Subsection (4)(b)(ii) or (iii), the employer's basic contribution

            
86


    
rate multiplied by the reserve factor established under Subsection (3)(b), calculated to four
            
87

    
decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction, plus the social contribution rate
            
88

    
established under Subsection (2), and the result calculated to three decimal places, disregarding
            
89

    
any remaining fraction;
            
90

    
    (ii)  if under Subsection (4)(b)(i), the overall contribution rate calculation for an
            
91

    
employer is greater than 7% plus the applicable social contribution rate, the overall
            
92

    
contribution rate for the employer shall be reduced to 7% plus the applicable social
            
93

    
contribution rate; or
            
94

    
    (iii)  if under Subsection (4)(b)(i), the overall contribution rate calculation for a new
            
95

    
employer is less than 1.1%, the overall contribution rate for the new employer shall be
            
96

    
increased to 1.1%.
            
97

    
    (c)  The overall contribution rate described under this Subsection (4) does not include
            
98

    
the addition of any penalty applicable to an employer:
            
99

    
    (i)  as a result of delinquency in the payment of contributions as provided in Subsection
            
100

    
(9); or
            
101

    
    (ii)  that is assessed a penalty rate under Subsection 

35A-4-304

(5)(a).
            
102

    
    (5) (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the basic contribution rate for a
            
103

    
new employer is based on the average benefit cost rate experienced by employers of the major
            
104

    
industry, as defined by department rule, to which the new employer belongs.
            
105

    
    (b)  Except as provided in Subsection (5)(c), by January 1 of each year, the basic
            
106

    
contribution rate to be used in computing a new employer's overall contribution rate under
            
107

    
Subsection (4) is the benefit cost rate that is the greater of:
            
108

    
    (i)  the amount calculated by dividing the total benefit costs charged back to both active
            
109

    
and inactive employers of the same major industry for the last two fiscal years by the total
            
110

    
taxable wages paid by those employers that were paid during the same time period, computed
            
111

    
to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction; or
            
112

    
    (ii)  1%.
            
113

    
    (c)  If the major industrial classification assigned to a new employer is an industry for

            
114


    
which a benefit cost rate does not exist because the industry has not operated in the state or has
            
115

    
not been covered under this chapter, the employer's basic contribution rate is 5.4%.  This basic
            
116

    
contribution rate is used in computing the employer's overall contribution rate under
            
117

    
Subsection (4).
            
118

    
    (6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and except as provided in
            
119

    
Subsection (7), if an employing unit that moves into this state is declared to be a qualified
            
120

    
employer because it has sufficient payroll and benefit cost experience under another state, a
            
121

    
rate shall be computed on the same basis as a rate is computed for all other employers subject
            
122

    
to this chapter if that unit furnishes adequate records on which to compute the rate.
            
123

    
    (7)  An employer who begins to operate in this state after having operated in another
            
124

    
state shall be assigned the maximum overall contribution rate until the employer acquires
            
125

    
sufficient experience in this state to be considered a "qualified employer" if the employer is:
            
126

    
    (a)  regularly engaged as a contractor in the construction, improvement, or repair of
            
127

    
buildings, roads, or other structures on lands;
            
128

    
    (b)  generally regarded as being a construction contractor or a subcontractor specialized
            
129

    
in some aspect of construction; or
            
130

    
    (c)  required to have a contractor's license or similar qualification under Title 58,
            
131

    
Chapter 55, Utah Construction Trades Licensing Act, or the equivalent in laws of another state.
            
132

    
    (8) (a)  If an employer acquires the business or all or substantially all the assets of
            
133

    
another employer and the other employer had discontinued operations upon the acquisition or
            
134

    
transfers its trade or business, or a portion of its trade or business, under Subsection
            
135

    

35A-4-304

(3)(a):
            
136

    
    (i)  for purposes of determining and establishing the acquiring party's qualifications for
            
137

    
an experience rating classification, the payrolls of both employers during the qualifying period
            
138

    
shall be jointly considered in determining the period of liability with respect to:
            
139

    
    (A)  the filing of contribution reports;
            
140

    
    (B)  the payment of contributions; and
            
141

    
    (C) the benefit costs of both employers;

            
142


    
    (ii)  the transferring employer shall be divested of the transferring employer's
            
143

    
unemployment experience provided the transferring employer had discontinued operations, but
            
144

    
only to the extent as defined under Subsection 

35A-4-304

(3)(c); and
            
145

    
    (iii)  if an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion of its trade or business,
            
146

    
as defined under Subsection 

35A-4-304

(3), the transferring employer may not be divested of its
            
147

    
employer's unemployment experience.
            
148

    
    (b) An employing unit or prospective employing unit that acquires the unemployment
            
149

    
experience of an employer shall, for all purposes of this chapter, be an employer as of the date
            
150

    
of acquisition.
            
151

    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Section 

35A-4-310

, when a transferring employer, as provided in
            
152

    
Subsection (8)(a), is divested of the employer's unemployment experience by transferring all of
            
153

    
the employer's business to another and by ceasing operations as of the date of the transfer, the
            
154

    
transferring employer shall cease to be an employer, as defined by this chapter, as of the date of
            
155

    
transfer.
            
156

    
    (9) (a) A rate of less than the maximum overall contribution rate is effective only for
            
157

    
new employers and to those qualified employers who, except for amounts due under division
            
158

    
determinations that have not become final, paid all contributions prescribed by the division for
            
159

    
the four consecutive calendar quarters in the fiscal year immediately preceding the computation
            
160

    
date.
            
161

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding Subsections (1), (5), (6), and (8), an employer who fails to pay all
            
162

    
contributions prescribed by the division for the four consecutive calendar quarters in the fiscal
            
163

    
year immediately preceding the computation date, except for amounts due under
            
164

    
determinations that have not become final, shall pay a contribution rate equal to the overall
            
165

    
contribution rate determined under the experience rating provisions of this chapter, plus a
            
166

    
surcharge of 1% of wages.
            
167

    
    (c)  An employer who pays all required contributions shall, for the current contribution
            
168

    
year, be assigned a rate based upon the employer's own experience as provided under the
            
169

    
experience rating provisions of this chapter effective the first day of the calendar quarter in

            
170


    
which the payment was made.
            
171

    
    (d)  Delinquency in filing contribution reports may not be the basis for denial of a rate
            
172

    
less than the maximum contribution rate.
            
173

    
    (10)  If an employer makes a contribution payment based on the overall contribution
            
174

    
rate in effect at the time the payment was made and a provision of this section retroactively
            
175

    
reduces the overall contribution rate for that payment, the division:
            
176

    
    (a)  may not directly refund the difference between what the employer paid and what
            
177

    
the employer would have paid under the new rate; and
            
178

    
    (b)  shall allow the employer to make an adjustment to a future contribution payment to
            
179

    
offset the difference between what the employer paid and what the employer would have paid
            
180

    
under the new rate.
