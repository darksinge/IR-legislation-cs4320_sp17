This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                           AMENDS                                        , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .    Section                  is amended to read                                          .  Collection, remittance, and payment of tax by vendors and consumers                              Returns    Direct payment by purchaser of vehicle    Other liability for collection    Credits                              Deposit and sale of security    Penalties.                                      a   Each vendor shall pay or collect and remit the sales and use taxes imposed by this                           chapter if within this state the vendor                                 i   has or utilizes an office, distribution house, sales house, warehouse, service enterprise,                           or other place of business                                 ii   maintains a stock of goods                                 iii   engages in regular or systematic solicitation of sale of tangible personal property,                           whether or not accepted in this state, by the distribution of catalogs, periodicals, advertising flyers,                           or other advertising by means of print, radio, or television, or by mail, telegraphy, telephone,                           computer data base, optic, microwave, or other communication system for the purpose of selling,                           at retail, tangible personal property                                 iv   regularly engages in the delivery of property in this state other than by common carrier                           or United States mail  or                                v   regularly engages in any activity in connection with the leasing or servicing of property                              located within this state.                                b   If none of the conditions listed under Subsection     a  exist, the vendor is not                           responsible for the collection of the use tax but each person storing, using, or consuming tangible                           personal property is responsible for remitting the use tax.                                c   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection     a , the ownership of property that is                           located at the premises of a printer s facility with which the retailer has contracted for printing and                           that consists of the final printed product, property that becomes a part of the final printed product,                           or copy from which the printed product is produced, shall not result in the retailer being  deemed                           considered to have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales house, warehouse, service                           enterprise, or other place of business, or to maintain a stock of goods, within this state.                                    a   Each vendor shall collect the sales or use tax from the purchaser.                                b   A vendor may not collect as tax an amount, without regard to fractional parts of one                           cent, in excess of the tax computed at the rates prescribed by this chapter.                                c   i   Each vendor shall                                 A   give the purchaser a receipt for the use tax collected  or                                B   bill the use tax as a separate item and declare the name of this state and the vendor s                           use tax license number on the invoice for the sale.                                ii   The receipt or invoice is prima facie evidence that the vendor has collected the use tax                           and relieves the purchaser of the liability for reporting the use tax to the commission as a                           consumer.                                d   A vendor is not required to maintain a separate account for the tax collected, but is                            deemed  considered to be a person charged with receipt, safekeeping, and transfer of public                           moneys.                                e   Taxes collected by a vendor pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the benefit                           of the state and for payment to the commission in the manner and at the time provided for in this                           chapter.                                f   If any vendor, during any reporting period, collects as a tax an amount in excess of the                           lawful state and local percentage of total taxable sales allowed under this part and Part  , the                           vendor shall remit to the commission the full amount of the tax imposed under this part and Part                             plus any excess.                                g   If the accounting methods regularly employed by the vendor in the transaction of the                              vendor s business are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month or quarterly period                           will impose unnecessary hardships, the commission may accept reports at intervals that will, in its                           opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer or vendor and will not jeopardize collection                           of the tax.                                    Each person storing, using, or consuming tangible personal property under Subsection                                             is liable for the use tax imposed under this chapter.                                    a   Except as provided in Subsection     and in Section                  , the sales or use tax                           imposed by this chapter is due and payable to the commission quarterly on or before the last day                           of the month next succeeding each calendar quarterly period.                                b   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of the month next succeeding each calendar                           quarterly period, file with the commission a return for the preceding quarterly period.  The vendor                           shall remit with the return the amount of the tax required under this chapter to be collected or paid                           for the period covered by the return.                                c   Each return shall contain information and be in a form the commission prescribes by                           rule.                                d   The sales tax as computed in the return shall be based upon the total nonexempt sales                           made during the period, including both cash and charge sales.                                e   The use tax as computed in the return shall be based upon the total amount of sales or                           purchases for storage, use, or other consumption in this state made during the period, including                           both by cash and by charge.                                f   The commission may by rule extend the time for making returns and paying the taxes.                            No extension may be for more than    days.                                g   The commission may require returns and payment of the tax to be made for other than                           quarterly periods if it  deems  considers it necessary in order to ensure the payment of the tax                           imposed by this chapter.                                     a    On each vehicle sale made by other than a regular licensed vehicle dealer, the                           purchaser shall pay the sales or use tax directly to the commission if the vehicle is subject to titling                           or registration under the laws of this state.  The commission shall collect the tax when the vehicle                           is titled or registered.                                 b   Upon application for title or registration of each vehicle sold by a regular licensed                          vehicle dealer, the dealer shall certify to the commission whether or not the dealer is current in the                             payment and reporting of sales or use tax, as required by Subsection    .  Each vehicle dealer not                          in compliance with Subsection     shall remit the sales or use tax to the commission upon                          application for title or registration of the vehicle.  Any violation of this subsection, or the                          falsification of any required information, is a class A misdemeanor.                                     If any sale of tangible personal property or any other taxable item or service under                           Subsection                     , is made by a wholesaler to a retailer, the wholesaler is not responsible                           for the collection or payment of the tax imposed on the sale if the retailer represents that the                           personal property is purchased by the retailer for resale and the personal property thereafter is not                           resold.  Instead, the retailer is solely liable for the tax.                                    If any sale of property or service subject to the tax is made to a person prepaying sales                            or use tax in accordance with Title   , Chapter   , Resource Development, or to a contractor or                            subcontractor of that person, the person to whom such payment or consideration is payable is not                            responsible for the collection or payment of the sales or use tax if the person prepaying the sales                            or use tax represents that the amount prepaid as sales or use tax has not been fully credited against                            sales or use tax due and payable under the rules promulgated by the commission. Instead, the                            person prepaying the sales or use tax is solely liable for the tax.                                     Credit is allowed for prepaid taxes and for taxes paid on that portion of an account                            determined to be worthless and actually charged off for income tax purposes or on the portion of                            the purchase price remaining unpaid at the time of a repossession made under the terms of a                            conditional sales contract.                                     a   The commission may require any person subject to the tax imposed under this                            chapter to deposit with it security as the commission determines, if the commission  deems                            considers it necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.                                 b   The commission may sell the security at public sale if it becomes necessary to do so                            in order to recover any tax, interest, or penalty due.                                 c   The commission shall serve notice of the sale upon the person who deposited the                            securities either personally or by mail.  If the notice is by mail, notice sent to the last known                            address as it appears in the records of the commission is sufficient for the purposes of this                            requirement.                                 d   The commission shall return to the person who deposited the security any amount of                            the sale proceeds that exceed the amounts due under this chapter.                                         a    It is unlawful for a  A vendor may not, with intent to evade any tax,  to  fail to                            timely remit the full amount of tax required by this chapter. A violation of this section is                            punishable as provided in Section                 .                                 b   Each person who fails to pay any tax to the state or any amount of tax required to be                            paid to the state, except amounts determined to be due by the commission under Sections                                           and                  , within the time required by this chapter, or who fails to file any return                            as required by this chapter, shall pay, in addition to the tax, penalties and interest as provided in                            Section                  .                                 c   For purposes of prosecution under this section, each quarterly tax period in which a                            vendor, with intent to evade any tax, collects a tax and fails to timely remit the full amount of the                            tax required to be remitted, constitutes a separate offense.
