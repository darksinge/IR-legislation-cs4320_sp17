10    AMENDS:

11         77-27-2, as last amended by Chapter 308, Laws of Utah 1997

12    Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

13        Section 1.  Section  77-27-2 is amended to read:

14         77-27-2.  Board of Pardons and Parole -- Creation -- Compensation -- Functions.

15        (1)  There is created the Board of Pardons and Parole.  The board shall consist of five

16    full-time members and five pro tempore members to be appointed by the governor with the advice

17    and consent of the Senate as provided in this section.  The members of the board shall be resident

18    citizens of the state.  The governor shall establish salaries for the members of the board within the

19    salary range fixed by the Legislature in Title 67, Chapter 22, State Officer Compensation.

20        (2) (a) (i)  The full-time board members shall serve terms of five years.  The terms of the

21    full-time members shall be staggered so one board member is appointed for a term of five years

22    on March 1 of each year.

23        (ii)  The pro tempore members shall serve terms of five years.  The two pro tempore

24    members added by Subsection (1) shall be appointed to terms that both commence on May 1,

25    1996, and respectively end on February 28, 1999, and February 29, 2000.  These terms are reduced

26    by two and one years respectively so that the appointment of one pro tempore member expires

27    every year beginning in 1996.  Terms previously set to expire will now expire the last day of


1    February of their respective years.

2        (b)  All vacancies occurring on the board for any cause shall be filled by the governor with

3    the advice and consent of the Senate pursuant to this section for the unexpired term of the vacating

4    member.

5        (c)  The governor may at any time remove any member of the board for inefficiency,

6    neglect of duty, malfeasance or malfeasance in office, or for cause upon a hearing.

7        (d)  A member of the board may not hold any other office in the government of the United

11    the holding of hearings at any time or any place within or without the state, or for the purpose of

13    whether parole, pardon, commutation, termination of sentence, or remission of fines or forfeitures

14    may be granted or restitution ordered in individual cases is deemed the action of the board.  A

15    majority vote of the five full-time members of the board is required for adoption of rules or

16    policies of general applicability as provided by statute.  However, a vacancy on the board does not

17    impair the right of the remaining board members to exercise any duty or authority of the board as

18    long as a majority of the board remains.

19        (f)  Any investigation, inquiry, or hearing that the board has authority to undertake or hold

20    may be conducted by any board member or an examiner appointed by the board.  When any of

21    these actions are approved and confirmed by the board and filed in its office, they are considered

22    to be the action of the board and have the same effect as if originally made by the board.

23        (g)  When a full-time board member is absent or in other extraordinary circumstances the

24    chair may, as dictated by public interest and efficient administration of the board, assign a pro

25    tempore member to act in the place of a full-time member.  Pro tempore members shall receive a

26    per diem rate of compensation as established by the Division of Finance and all actual and

27    necessary expenses incurred in attending to official business.

28        (h)  The chair may request staff and administrative support as necessary from the

29    Department of Corrections.

4    criminal law, judicial procedure, corrections policies and procedures, and behavioral sciences.
