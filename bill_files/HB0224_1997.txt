Section    A        Effective           is amended to read                  A        Effective          .  Medical panel    Medical director or medical           consultants    Discretionary authority of department to refer case    Findings and reports              Objections to report    Hearing    Expenses.                   a   Upon the filing of a claim for compensation for injury by accident, or for death,          arising out of and in the course of employment, and if the employer or its insurance carrier denies          liability, the department may refer the medical aspects of the case to a medical panel appointed by          the department.               b   When a claim for compensation based upon disability or death due to an occupational          disease is filed with the department, the department shall, except upon stipulation of all parties,          appoint an impartial medical panel.               c   A medical panel shall consist of one or more physicians specializing in the treatment          of the disease or condition involved in the claim.                d   As an alternative method of obtaining an impartial medical evaluation of the medical         aspects of a controverted case, the department may employ a medical director or medical         consultants on a full time or part time basis for the purpose of evaluating the medical evidence and         advising the  department with respect to its ultimate fact finding responsibility.  If all parties agree         to the use of a medical director or medical consultants, they shall be allowed to function in the         same manner and under the same procedures as required of a medical panel.                  a   The medical panel, medical director, or medical consultants shall make such study,         take such X rays, and perform such tests, including post mortem examinations if authorized by         the  department, as it may determine to be necessary or desirable.               b   The medical panel, medical director, or medical consultants shall make a report in          writing to the department in a form prescribed by the department, and also make such additional          findings as the department may require.  In occupational disease cases, the panel shall certify to          the  department the extent, if any, of the disability of the claimant from performing work for          remuneration or profit, and whether the sole cause of the disability or death, in the opinion of the          panel, results from the occupational disease and whether any other causes have aggravated,          prolonged, accelerated, or in any way contributed to the disability or death, and if so, the extent          in percentage to which the other causes have so contributed.               c   The department shall promptly distribute full copies of the report to the applicant, the          employer, and its insurance carrier by  certified mail with return receipt requested.  Within    days          after the report is deposited in the United States post office, the applicant, the employer, or its          insurance carrier may file with the department written objections to the report.  If no written          objections are filed within that period, the report is considered admitted in evidence.               d   The department may base its finding and decision on the report of the panel, medical          director, or medical consultants, but is not bound by the report if other substantial conflicting          evidence in the case supports a contrary finding.               e   If objections to the report are filed, the department may set the case for hearing to          determine the facts and issues involved.  At the hearing, any party so desiring may request the           department to have the chairman of the medical panel, the medical director, or the medical          consultants present at the hearing for examination and cross examination. For good cause shown,          the department may order other members of the panel, with or without the chairman or the medical          director or medical consultants, to be present at the hearing for examination and                 cross examination.              f   The written report of the panel, medical director, or medical consultants may be         received as an exhibit at the hearing, but may not be considered as evidence in the case except as         far as it is sustained by the testimony admitted.              g    The  For any claim referred under Subsection     to a medical panel, medical director,         or medical consultant before July  ,     , the department shall pay out of the Employers         Reinsurance Fund established in Section   A                     i   expenses of the study and report of the medical panel, medical director, or medical          consultants  consultant  and               ii   the expenses of  their  the panel s, director s, or consultant s appearance before the          department  shall be paid out of the Employers  Reinsurance Fund .               h   For any claim referred under Subsection     to a medical panel, medical director, or          medical consultant on or after July  ,     , the department shall pay out of the Uninsured          Employers  Fund established in Section   A                      i   the expenses of the study and report of the medical panel, medical director, or medical          consultant  and               ii   the expenses of the panel s, director s, or consultant s appearance before the          department.
