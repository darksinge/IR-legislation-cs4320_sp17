Morgan                             This act modifies provisions relating to the State System of Public Education by eliminating                          a student s ability to opt out of participating in the school uniform program after an election                          has taken place unless a principal  finds extenuating circumstances.                          This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                           AMENDS                                  A       , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .

The Legislature recognizes that each student in the public schools should be                           allowed to learn in a safe environment which fosters the learning process and is free from                           unnecessary disruptions.                                          The Legislature further recognizes that the wearing of certain types of clothing                           identifies students as members of youth gangs and has contributed to disruptive behavior and                           violence in the public schools.                                          a   Local school boards and school principals may require students enrolled at a                           public school to wear a designated uniform during the school day in order to help avoid the                           disruption of the classroom atmosphere and decorum and prevent disturbances among students.                                b   The uniform policy authorized in Subsection           a  shall be adopted, if for more                           than one school, at the district level by the school board and, if for a single school, at the school                              level by the principal of the school subject to the following requirements                                 i  the adopting authority shall hold a public hearing on the matter prior to formal adoption                           of the school uniform policy                                 ii   A   the adopting authority shall hold an election for approval of a school uniform                           policy prior to its adoption and must receive an affirmative vote from a majority of those voting                           at the election  and                                B   only parents and guardians of students subject to the proposed uniform policy may vote                           at the election, limited to one vote per family.                                          a   A local school board or principal is required to hold an election to consider                           adoption of a school district or individual school uniform policy if initiative petitions are presented                           as follows                                 i   for a district uniform policy, a petition signed by a parent or guardian of     of the                           district s students presented to the local school board  and                                ii   for an individual school, a petition signed by a parent or guardian of     of the                           school s students presented to the principal.                                b   The procedures required in Subsection           b  apply to Subsection          .                                          a   The procedures set forth in Subsections           and           shall apply to                           the discontinuance or modification of a school uniform policy adopted under this section.                                b   A vote to discontinue an adopted school uniform policy may not take place during the                           first year of its operation.                                          The adopting authority shall establish the manner and time of an election required                           under this section.                                     a        A school uniform policy adopted under this section shall include a provision                            that would exempt a student from wearing a uniform at school if requested  by the student s                          custodial parent or legal guardian.  b   The request under Subsection     a  must be made   i   prior                          to the beginning of the school year for a student who is enrolled at the school at the beginning of                          the school year  or  ii   within    days from enrollment at the school for a student who enrolls                          during the school year.  c   The principal may  allowing a principal at any time during the school                           year to grant an exemption from wearing a uniform to a student who, because of extenuating                           circumstances, would not be able to wear a uniform.
