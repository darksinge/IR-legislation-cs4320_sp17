If the62     court determines that the circumstances are appropriate and that the dependent children would63     be adequately cared for, it may include an order allowing the noncustodial parent to provide64     child care for the dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the65     custodial parent.66          (3)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for67     the custody of the children and their support, maintenance, health, and dental care, and for68     distribution of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary.69          (4)  Child support, custody, visitation, and other matters related to children born to the70     mother and father after entry of the decree of divorce may be added to the decree by71     modification.72          (5) (a)  In determining parent-time rights of parents and visitation rights of grandparents73     and other members of the immediate family, the court shall consider the best interest of the74     child.75          (b)  Upon a specific finding by the court of the need for peace officer enforcement, the76     court may include in an order establishing a parent-time or visitation schedule a provision,77     among other things, authorizing any peace officer to enforce a court-ordered parent-time or78     visitation schedule entered under this chapter.79          (6)  If a petition for modification of child custody or parent-time provisions of a court80     order is made and denied, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the reasonable attorneys'81     fees expended by the prevailing party in that action, if the court determines that the petition82     was without merit and not asserted or defended against in good faith.83          (7)  If a petition alleges noncompliance with a parent-time order by a parent, or a84     visitation order by a grandparent or other member of the immediate family where a visitation or85     parent-time right has been previously granted by the court, the court may award to the86     prevailing party costs, including actual attorney fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing87     party because of the other party's failure to provide or exercise court-ordered visitation or88     parent-time.89          (8) (a)  The court shall consider at least the following factors in determining alimony:90          (i)  the financial condition and needs of the recipient spouse;91          (ii)  the recipient's earning capacity or ability to produce income, including the impact92     of diminished workplace experience resulting from primarily caring for a child of the payor93     spouse;94          (iii)  the ability of the payor spouse to provide support;95          (iv)  the length of the marriage;96          (v)  whether the recipient spouse has custody of minor children requiring support;97          (vi)  whether the recipient spouse worked in a business owned or operated by the payor98     spouse; and99          (vii)  whether the recipient spouse directly contributed to any increase in the payor100     spouse's skill by paying for education received by the payor spouse or enabling the payor101     spouse to attend school during the marriage.102          (b)  The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining whether to award103     alimony and the terms thereof.104          (c)  "Fault" means any of the following wrongful conduct during the marriage that105     substantially contributed to the breakup of the marriage relationship:106          (i)  engaging in sexual relations with a person other than the party's spouse;107          (ii)  knowingly and intentionally causing or attempting to cause physical harm to the108     other party or minor children;109          (iii)  knowingly and intentionally causing the other party or minor children to110     reasonably fear life-threatening harm; or111          (iv)  substantially undermining the financial stability of the other party or the minor112     children.113          (d)  The court may, when fault is at issue, close the proceedings and seal the court114     records.115          (e)  As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at the116     time of separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection (8)(a).  However, the117     court shall consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion, base118     alimony on the standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short119     duration, when no children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may120     consider the standard of living that existed at the time of the marriage.121          (f)  The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the parties'122     respective standards of living.123          (g)  When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major change in124     the income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change shall be125     considered in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony.  If one126     spouse's earning capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses during127     the marriage, the court may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital property128     and awarding alimony.129          (h)  In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no130     children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring131     each party to the condition which existed at the time of the marriage.132          (i) (i)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new133     orders regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not134     foreseeable at the time of the divorce.135          (ii)  The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address136     needs of the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court137     finds extenuating circumstances that justify that action.138          (iii)  In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not139     be considered, except as provided in this Subsection (8).140          (A)  The court may consider the subsequent spouse's financial ability to share living141     expenses.142          (B)  The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that143     the payor's improper conduct justifies that consideration.144          (j)  Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years that the145     marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony, the court finds extenuating146     circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.147          (9)  Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court148     that a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage or149     death of that former spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void ab150     initio, payment of alimony shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the151     action of annulment and the payor party's rights are determined.152          (10)  Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates153     upon establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with154     another person.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
