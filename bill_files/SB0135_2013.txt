28

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
62A-15-631

 is amended to read:
            
29

    
     62A-15-631.  Involuntary commitment under court order -- Examination --

31

    
    (1)  Proceedings for involuntary commitment of an individual who is 18 years of age or
            
32

    
older may be commenced by filing a written application with the district court of the county in
            
33

    
which the proposed patient resides or is found, by a responsible person who has reason to know
            
34

    
of the condition or circumstances of the proposed patient which lead to the belief that the
            
35

    
individual has a mental illness and should be involuntarily committed.  That application shall
            
36

    
be accompanied by:
            
37

    
    (a)  a certificate of a licensed physician or a designated examiner stating that within a
            
38

    
seven-day period immediately preceding the certification the physician or designated examiner
            
39

    
has examined the individual, and that the physician or designated examiner is of the opinion
            
40

    
that the individual is mentally ill and should be involuntarily committed; or
            
41

    
    (b)  a written statement by the applicant that:
            
42

    
    (i)  the individual has been requested to, but has refused to, submit to an examination of
            
43

    
mental condition by a licensed physician or designated examiner;
            
44

    
    (ii)  is sworn to under oath; and
            
45

    
    (iii)  states the facts upon which the application is based.
            
46

    
    (2)  [Before] (a)  Subject to Subsection (2)(b), before issuing a judicial order, the court
            
47

    
may require the applicant to consult with the appropriate local mental health authority, [or] and
            
48

    
may direct a mental health professional from that local mental health authority to interview the
            
49

    
applicant and the proposed patient to determine the existing facts and report them to the court.
            
50

    
    (b)  The consultation described in Subsection (2)(a):
            
51

    
    (i)  may take place at or before the hearing; and
            
52

    
    (ii)  is required if the local mental health authority appears at the hearing.
            
53

    
    (3)  If the court finds from the application, from any other statements under oath, or
            
54

    
from any reports from a mental health professional that there is a reasonable basis to believe
            
55

    
that the proposed patient has a mental illness [which] that poses a substantial danger, as
            
56

    
defined in Section 

62A-15-602

, to self or others requiring involuntary commitment pending
            
57

    
examination and hearing; or, if the proposed patient has refused to submit to an interview with

            
58


    
a mental health professional as directed by the court or to go to a treatment facility voluntarily,
            
59

    
the court may issue an order, directed to a mental health officer or peace officer, to
            
60

    
immediately place the proposed patient in the custody of a local mental health authority or in a
            
61

    
temporary emergency facility as provided in Section 

62A-15-634

 to be detained for the purpose
            
62

    
of examination.  Within 24 hours of the issuance of the order for examination, a local mental
            
63

    
health authority or its designee shall report to the court, orally or in writing, whether the patient
            
64

    
is, in the opinion of the examiners, mentally ill, whether the patient has agreed to become a
            
65

    
voluntary patient under Section 

62A-15-625

, and whether treatment programs are available and
            
66

    
acceptable without court proceedings.  Based on that information, the court may, without
            
67

    
taking any further action, terminate the proceedings and dismiss the application.  In any event,
            
68

    
if the examiner reports orally, the examiner shall immediately send the report in writing to the
            
69

    
clerk of the court.
            
70

    
    (4)  Notice of commencement of proceedings for involuntary commitment, setting forth
            
71

    
the allegations of the application and any reported facts, together with a copy of any official
            
72

    
order of detention, shall be provided by the court to a proposed patient before, or upon,
            
73

    
placement in the custody of a local mental health authority or, with respect to any individual
            
74

    
presently in the custody of a local mental health authority whose status is being changed from
            
75

    
voluntary to involuntary, upon the filing of an application for that purpose with the court.  A
            
76

    
copy of that order of detention shall be maintained at the place of detention.
            
77

    
    (5)  Notice of commencement of those proceedings shall be provided by the court as
            
78

    
soon as practicable to the applicant, any legal guardian, any immediate adult family members,
            
79

    
legal counsel for the parties involved, the local mental health authority or its designee, and any
            
80

    
other persons whom the proposed patient or the court shall designate.  That notice shall advise
            
81

    
those persons that a hearing may be held within the time provided by law.  If the patient has
            
82

    
refused to permit release of information necessary for provisions of notice under this
            
83

    
subsection, the extent of notice shall be determined by the court.
            
84

    
    (6)  Proceedings for commitment of an individual under the age of 18 years to the
            
85

    
division may be commenced by filing a written application with the juvenile court in

            
86


    
accordance with the provisions of Part 7, Commitment of Persons Under Age 18 to Division of
            
87

    
Substance Abuse and Mental Health.
            
88

    
    (7)  The district court may, in its discretion, transfer the case to any other district court
            
89

    
within this state, provided that the transfer will not be adverse to the interest of the proposed
            
90

    
patient.
            
91

    
    (8) (a)  Within 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, of the
            
92

    
issuance of a judicial order, or after commitment  of a proposed patient to a local mental health
            
93

    
authority under court order for detention or examination, the court shall appoint two designated
            
94

    
examiners to examine the proposed patient.  If requested by the proposed patient's counsel, the
            
95

    
court shall appoint, as one of the examiners, a reasonably available qualified person designated
            
96

    
by counsel.  The examinations, to be conducted separately, shall be held at the home of the
            
97

    
proposed patient, a hospital or other medical facility, or at any other suitable place that is not
            
98

    
likely to have a harmful effect on the patient's health.
            
99

    
    (b)  The examiner shall inform the patient if not represented by an attorney that, if
            
100

    
desired, the patient does not have to say anything, the nature and reasons for the examination,
            
101

    
that it was ordered by the court, that any information volunteered could form part of the basis
            
102

    
for [his or her] the patient's involuntary commitment, and that findings resulting from the
            
103

    
examination will be made available to the court.
            
104

    
    (c)  A time shall be set for a hearing to be held within 10 calendar days of the
            
105

    
appointment of the designated examiners, unless those examiners or a local mental health
            
106

    
authority or its designee informs the court prior to that hearing date that the patient is not
            
107

    
mentally ill, that the patient has agreed to become a voluntary patient under Section
            
108

    

62A-15-625

, or that treatment programs are available and acceptable without court
            
109

    
proceedings, in which event the court may, without taking any further action, terminate the
            
110

    
proceedings and dismiss the application.
            
111

    
    (9) (a)  Before the hearing, an opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be
            
112

    
afforded to every proposed patient, and if neither the patient nor others provide counsel, the
            
113

    
court shall appoint counsel and allow counsel sufficient time to consult with the patient before

            
114


    
the hearing.  In the case of an indigent patient, the payment of reasonable attorney fees for
            
115

    
counsel, as determined by the court, shall be made by the county in which the patient resides or
            
116

    
was found.
            
117

    
    (b)  The proposed patient, the applicant, and all other persons to whom notice is
            
118

    
required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to
            
119

    
present and cross-examine witnesses.  The court may, in its discretion, receive the testimony of
            
120

    
any other person.  The court may allow a waiver of the patient's right to appear only for good
            
121

    
cause shown, and that cause shall be made a matter of court record.
            
122

    
    (c)  The court is authorized to exclude all persons not necessary for the conduct of the
            
123

    
proceedings and may, upon motion of counsel, require the testimony of each examiner to be
            
124

    
given out of the presence of any other examiners.
            
125

    
    (d)  The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with
            
126

    
orderly procedure, and in a physical setting that is not likely to have a harmful effect on the
            
127

    
mental health of the proposed patient.
            
128

    
    (e)  The court shall consider all relevant historical and material information [which] that
            
129

    
is offered, subject to the rules of evidence, including reliable hearsay under Rule 1102, Utah
            
130

    
Rules of Evidence.
            
131

    
    (f) (i)  A local mental health authority or its designee, or the physician in charge of the
            
132

    
patient's care shall, at the time of the hearing, provide the court with the following information:
            
133

    
    (A)  the detention order;
            
134

    
    (B)  admission notes;
            
135

    
    (C)  the diagnosis;
            
136

    
    (D)  any doctors' orders;
            
137

    
    (E)  progress notes;
            
138

    
    (F)  nursing notes; and
            
139

    
    (G)  medication records pertaining to the current commitment.
            
140

    
    (ii)  That information shall also be supplied to the patient's counsel at the time of the
            
141

    
hearing, and at any time prior to the hearing upon request.

            
142


    
    (10)  The court shall order commitment of an individual who is 18 years of age or older
            
143

    
to a local mental health authority if, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the
            
144

    
information presented in accordance with Subsection (9)(e), the court finds by clear and
            
145

    
convincing evidence that:
            
146

    
    (a)  the proposed patient has a mental illness;
            
147

    
    (b)  because of the proposed patient's mental illness the proposed patient poses a
            
148

    
substantial danger, as defined in Section 

62A-15-602

, to self or others, which may include the
            
149

    
inability to provide the basic necessities of life such as food, clothing, and shelter, if allowed to
            
150

    
remain at liberty;
            
151

    
    (c)  the patient lacks the ability to engage in a rational decision-making process
            
152

    
regarding the acceptance of mental treatment as demonstrated by evidence of inability to weigh
            
153

    
the possible risks of accepting or rejecting treatment;
            
154

    
    (d)  there is no appropriate less-restrictive alternative to a court order of commitment;
            
155

    
and
            
156

    
    (e)  the local mental health authority can provide the individual with treatment that is
            
157

    
adequate and appropriate to the individual's conditions and needs.  In the absence of the
            
158

    
required findings of the court after the hearing, the court shall forthwith dismiss the
            
159

    
proceedings.
            
160

    
    (11) (a)  The order of commitment shall designate the period for which the individual
            
161

    
shall be treated.  When the individual is not under an order of commitment at the time of the
            
162

    
hearing, that period may not exceed six months without benefit of a review hearing.  Upon
            
163

    
such a review hearing, to be commenced prior to the expiration of the previous order, an order
            
164

    
for commitment may be for an indeterminate period, if the court finds by clear and convincing
            
165

    
evidence that the required conditions in Subsection (10) will last for an indeterminate period.
            
166

    
    (b)  The court shall maintain a current list of all patients under its order of commitment. 
            
167

    
That list shall be reviewed to determine those patients who have been under an order of
            
168

    
commitment for the designated period.  At least two weeks prior to the expiration of the
            
169

    
designated period of any order of commitment still in effect, the court that entered the original

            
170


    
order shall inform the appropriate local mental health authority or its designee.  The local
            
171

    
mental health authority or its designee shall immediately reexamine the reasons upon which the
            
172

    
order of commitment was based.  If the local mental health authority or its designee determines
            
173

    
that the conditions justifying that commitment no longer exist, it shall discharge the patient
            
174

    
from involuntary commitment and immediately report that to the court.  Otherwise, the court
            
175

    
shall immediately appoint two designated examiners and proceed under Subsections (8)
            
176

    
through (10).
            
177

    
    (c)  The local mental health authority or its designee responsible for the care of a patient
            
178

    
under an order of commitment for an indeterminate period, shall at six-month intervals
            
179

    
reexamine the reasons upon which the order of indeterminate commitment was based.  If the
            
180

    
local mental health authority or its designee determines that the conditions justifying that
            
181

    
commitment no longer exist, that local mental health authority or its designee shall discharge
            
182

    
the patient from its custody and immediately report the discharge to the court.  If the local
            
183

    
mental health authority or its designee determines that the conditions justifying that
            
184

    
commitment continue to exist, the local mental health authority or its designee shall send a
            
185

    
written report of those findings to the court.  The patient and [his] the patient's counsel of
            
186

    
record shall be notified in writing that the involuntary commitment will be continued, the
            
187

    
reasons for that decision, and that the patient has the right to a review hearing by making a
            
188

    
request to the court.  Upon receiving the request, the court shall immediately appoint two
            
189

    
designated examiners and proceed under Subsections (8) through (10).
            
190

    
    (12)  In the event that the designated examiners are unable, because a proposed patient
            
191

    
refuses to submit to an examination, to complete that examination on the first attempt, the
            
192

    
court shall fix a reasonable compensation to be paid to those designated examiners for their
            
193

    
services.
            
194

    
    (13)  Any person committed as a result of an original hearing or a person's legally
            
195

    
designated representative who is aggrieved by the findings, conclusions, and order of the court
            
196
