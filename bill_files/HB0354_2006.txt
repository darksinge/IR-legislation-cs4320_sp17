If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the                             tax to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.                                       A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the                             application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years                             from the time the return was due for the taxable year of the loss.                                       If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and                             withheld under Section                  , a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent                             that the amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.                                          If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax,                             the amount is an overpayment.                                       If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable                             period of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.                                       a   If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in  federal taxable                             adjusted gross income reported on  his  the taxpayer s federal income tax return, or to report a                             change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for                             federal income tax purposes, or to file an amended return with the commission, a claim for                             credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two                             years from the date the notice of the change, correction, or amended return was required to be                             filed with the commission.                                  b   If the report or amended return is not filed within    days, interest on any resulting                             refund or credit ceases to accrue after the    day period.                                  c   The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in                             tax attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer s amended                             federal income tax return.                                  d   Except as specifically provided, this section does not affect the amount or the time                             within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.                                       No credit or refund may be allowed or made if the overpayment is less than   .                                       The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the tax paid during the three                             years immediately preceding the filing of the claim, or if no claim is filed, then during the three                             years immediately preceding the allowance of the credit or refund.                                       In the case of an overpayment of tax by the employer under the withholding                             provisions of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent                             that the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the                             provisions of this chapter.                                       If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under this chapter dies, the commission                             may make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer s estate.  If                             there is no executor or administrator, payment may be made to those persons who establish                             entitlement to inherit the property of the decedent in the proportions set out in Title   , Utah                             Uniform Probate Code.                                          Where an overpayment relates to adjustments to net income referred to in                             Subsection                       c      , credit may be allowed or a refund paid any time before the                             expiration of the period within which a deficiency may be assessed.                                       An overpayment of a tax imposed by this chapter shall accrue interest at the rate                             and in the manner prescribed in Section                 .
