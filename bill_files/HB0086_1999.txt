to be assessed and collected in the same                            manner as contributions due under this section equal to    of the contribution due if the failure                            to file on time was not more than    days, with an additional    for each additional    days or                            fraction thereof during which the failure continued, but not to exceed     in the aggregate and not                            less than     with respect to each reporting period.                                 ii   If a report is filed after such time and it is shown to the satisfaction of the division or                            its authorized representative that the failure to file was due to a reasonable cause and not to willful                            neglect, no addition shall be made to the contribution.                                 c   i   If contributions are unpaid after ten days from the date of the mailing or personal

days after the mailing or personal delivery,                            arrangements for payment have been made with the division, or its authorized representative, and

                        a   If an employer fails to file a report when prescribed by the division for the purpose                            of determining the amount of the employer s contribution due under this chapter, or if the report                            when filed is incorrect or insufficient or is not satisfactory to the division, the division may                            determine the amount of wages paid for employment during the period or periods with respect to                            which the reports were or should have been made and the amount of contribution due from the                            employer on the basis of such information as it may be able to obtain.                                 b   The division shall give written notice of the determination to the employer.                                 c   The determination is considered correct unless                                  i   the employer, within ten days after mailing or personal delivery of notice of the                            determination, applies to the division for a review of the determination as provided in Section                                  A            or                                 ii   unless the division or its authorized representative of its own motion reviews the                            determination.                                 d   The amount of contribution so determined shall be subject to penalties and interest as                            provided in Subsection    .                                     a   If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of contributions, interest,                            or penalties on the contributions, or any claimant defaults in any repayment of benefit                            overpayments and penalties on the overpayments, the amount due shall be collectible by civil                            action in the name of the division, and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the costs of the                            action.                                 b   Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions, interest or penalties                            from an employer, or benefit overpayments and penalties from a claimant shall be                                  i   heard by the court at the earliest possible date  and                                 ii   entitled to preference upon the calendar of the court over all other civil actions except                                  A   petitions for judicial review under this chapter  and                                 B   cases arising under the workers  compensation law of this state.                                 c   i   To collect contributions, interest or penalties, or benefit overpayments and penalties                            due from employers or claimants located outside Utah the division may employ private collectors                            providing debt collection services outside Utah.  Accounts may be placed with private collectors                            only after the employer or claimant has been given a final notice that the division intends to place                            the account with a private collector for further collection action.  The notice shall advise the                            employer or claimant of the employer s or claimant s rights under this chapter and the rules                            applicable of the department.                                 ii   A private collector may receive as compensation up to, but no more than,     of the                            lesser of the amount collected or the amount due, plus the costs and fees of any civil action or                            post judgment remedy instituted by the private collector with the approval of the division.  The                            employer or claimant shall be liable to pay the compensation of the collector, costs, and fees in                            addition to the original amount due.                                 iii   A private collector is subject to the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,                               U.S.C. Sec.      et seq.                                 iv   A civil action may not be maintained by any private collector without specific prior                               written approval of the division.  When division approval is given for civil action against an                            employer or claimant, the division may cooperate with the private collector to the extent necessary                            to effect the civil action.                                 d   i   Notwithstanding Section       A          , the division may disclose the contribution,                            interest, penalties or benefit overpayments and penalties, costs due, the name of the employer or                            claimant, and the employer s or claimant s address and telephone number when any collection                            matter is referred to a private collector under Subsection     c .                                 ii   A private collector is subject to the confidentiality requirements and penalty provisions                            provided in Section       A           and Subsection       A             , except to the extent disclosure is                            necessary in any civil action to enforce collection of the amounts due.                                 e  An action taken by the division under this section may not be construed to be an                            election to forego other collection procedures by the division.                                     a   In the event of any distribution of an employer s assets under an order of any court                            under the laws of Utah, including any receivership, assignment for benefits of creditors,                            adjudicated insolvency, composition, or similar proceedings, contributions then or thereafter due                            shall be paid in full prior to all other claims except taxes and claims for wages of not more than                                 to each claimant, earned within five months of the commencement of the proceeding.                                 b   If an employer commences a proceeding in the Federal Bankruptcy Court under any                            chapter of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of     ,    U.S.C.     et seq., as amended, contributions,                            interest, and penalties then or thereafter due shall be entitled to the priority provided for taxes,                            interest, and penalties in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of     .                                     a   In addition and as an alternative to any other remedy provided by this chapter and                            provided that no appeal or other proceeding for review provided by this chapter is then pending                            and the time for taking it has expired, the division may issue a warrant in duplicate, under its                            official seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding the sheriff to levy upon                            and sell the real and personal property of a delinquent employer or claimant found within the                            sheriff s county for the payment of the contributions due thereon, with the added penalties, interest,                            or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs, and to return the warrant to the division and pay                            into the fund the money collected by virtue of the warrant by a time to be therein specified, not                            more than    days from the date of the warrant.                                 b   Immediately upon receipt of the warrant in duplicate, the sheriff shall file the duplicate                               with the clerk of the district court in the sheriff s county.  The clerk shall enter in the judgment                            docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the delinquent employer or claimant                            mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the amount of the contribution, penalties,                            interest, or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs, for which the warrant is issued and the                            date when the duplicate is filed.                                 c   The amount of the warrant so docketed shall                                  i   have the force and effect of an execution against all personal property of the delinquent                            employer  and                                 ii   become a lien upon the real property of the delinquent employer or claimant in the                            same manner and to the same extent as a judgment duly rendered by any district court and                            docketed in the office of the clerk.                                 d   After docketing, the sheriff shall                                  i   proceed in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to execution issued                            against property upon judgments of a court of record  and                                 ii   be entitled to the same fees for the sheriff s services in executing the warrant, to be                            collected in the same manner.                                     a   Contributions imposed by this chapter are a lien upon the property of any employer                            liable for the contribution required to be collected under this section who shall sell out the                            employer s business or stock of goods or shall quit business, if the employer fails to make a final                            report and payment on the date subsequent to the date of selling or quitting business on which they                            are due and payable as prescribed by rule.                                 b   An employer s successor, successors, or assigns, if any, shall be required to withhold                            sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of the contributions and interest or penalties                            due and payable until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the division                            showing that they have been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.  If the purchaser                            of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold sufficient purchase money, the purchaser shall be                            personally liable for the payment of the amount of the contributions required to be paid by the                            former owner, interest and penalties accrued and unpaid by the former owner, owners, or assignors.                                     a  If any employer is delinquent in the payment of any contribution, the division may                            give notice of the amount of the delinquency by registered mail to all persons having in their                            possession or under their control, any credits or other personal property belonging to the employer,                               or owing any debts to the employer at the time of the receipt by them of the notice.                                 b   Any persons notified under Subsection     a  shall neither transfer nor make any other                            disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts until                                  i   the division has consented to a transfer or disposition  or                                 ii      days after the receipt of the notice.                                 c   All persons notified under Subsection     a  shall within five days after receipt of the                            notice, advise the division of credits, other personal property, or other debts in their possession,                            under their control or owing by them, as the case may be.                                     a   Each employer shall furnish the division necessary information for the proper                            administration of this chapter and shall include wage information for each employee, for each                            calendar quarter beginning October  ,     .  The information shall be furnished at a time, in the                            form, and to those individuals as the department may by rule require.                                 b   Each employer shall furnish each individual worker who is separated that information                            as the department may by rule require, and shall furnish within    hours of the receipt of a request                            from the division a report of the earnings of any individual during the individual s base period.                             The report shall be on a form prescribed by the division and contain all information prescribed by                            the division.                                 c   For each failure by an employer to conform to this Subsection     the division shall,                            unless good cause is shown to the satisfaction of the division for the failure, assess a     penalty                            to be collected in the same manner as contributions due under this chapter.                                     If any person liable to pay any contribution or benefit overpayment imposed by this                            chapter neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount, including any interest,                            additional amount, addition to contributions, or assessable penalty, together with any additional                            accruable costs, shall be a lien in favor of the division upon all property and rights to property,                            whether real or personal belonging to the person.                                      a   The lien imposed by Subsection     arises at the time the assessment, as defined                            in the department rules, is made and continues until the liability for the amount so assessed, or a                            judgment against the taxpayer arising out of the liability, is satisfied.                                 b   The lien imposed by Subsection     is not valid as against any purchaser, holder of a                            security interest, mechanics lien holder, or judgment lien creditor until a warrant which meets the                            requirements of Subsection     has been filed with the clerk of the district court.  For the purposes                               of Subsection      b                                   i    Judgment lien creditor  means a person who obtains a valid judgment of a court of                            record for recovery of specific property or a sum certain of money, and who in the case of a                            recovery of money, has a perfected lien under the judgment on the property involved.  A judgment                            lien does not include inchoate liens such as attachment or garnishment liens until they ripen into                            a judgment.  A judgment lien does not include the determination or assessment of a quasi judicial                            authority, such as a state or federal taxing authority.                                 ii    Mechanics lien holder  means any person who has a lien on real property, or on the                            proceeds of a contract relating to real property, for services, labor, or materials furnished in                            connection with the construction or improvement of the property.  A person has a lien on the                            earliest date the lien becomes valid against subsequent purchasers without actual notice, but not                            before the person begins to furnish the services, labor, or materials.                                 iii    Person  means                                  A   an individual                                  B   a trust                                  C   an estate                                  D   a partnership                                  E   an association                                  F   a company                                  G   a limited liability company                                  H   a limited liability partnership  or                                 I   a corporation.                                 iv    Purchaser  means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or                            money s worth, acquires an interest, other than a lien or security interest, in property which is valid                            under state law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.                                 v    Security interest  means any interest in property acquired by contract for the purpose                            of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or liability.  A                            security interest exists at any time                                  A   the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under the law against                            a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation  and                                 B   to the extent that, at that time, the holder has parted with money or money s worth.
