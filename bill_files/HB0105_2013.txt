40

    
    (ix)  Section 

76-5-203

, attempted murder; or
            
41

    
    (b)  an offense other than those listed in Subsection (1)(a) involving the use of a
            
42

    
dangerous weapon, which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and the minor has been
            
43

    
previously adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous weapon,
            
44

    
which also would have been a felony if committed by an adult.
            
45

    
    (2)  All proceedings before the juvenile court related to charges filed under Subsection
            
46

    
(1) shall be conducted in conformity with the rules established by the Utah Supreme Court.
            
47

    
    (3) (a)  If the information alleges the violation of a felony listed in Subsection (1), the
            
48

    
state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish
            
49

    
probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection (1) has been committed
            
50

    
and that the defendant committed it.  If proceeding under Subsection (1)(b), the state shall have
            
51

    
the additional burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has
            
52

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
53

    
weapon.
            
54

    
    (b)  If the juvenile court judge finds the state has met its burden under this Subsection
            
55

    
(3), the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district
            
56

    
court in the same manner as an adult unless the juvenile court judge finds that [all of the
            
57

    
following conditions exist:] it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor and to the
            
58

    
public to bind over the defendant to the jurisdiction of the district court.

            
59


    
    (c)  In making the bind over determination in Subsection (3)(b), the judge shall consider
            
60

    
only the following:
            
61

    
    (i)  whether the minor has [not] been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense
            
62

    
involving the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult;
            
63

    
    (ii)  [that] if the offense was committed with one or more other persons, whether the
            
64

    
minor appears to have a greater or lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants; [and]
            
65

    
    (iii)  [that] the extent to which the minor's role in the offense was [not] committed in a
            
66

    
violent, aggressive, or premeditated manner[.];
            
67

    
    (iv)  the number and nature of the minor's prior adjudications in the juvenile court; and
            
68

    
    (v)  whether public safety is better served by adjudicating the minor in the juvenile
            
69

    
court or in the district court.
            
70

    
    [(c)] (d)  Once the state has met its burden under [this] Subsection (3)(a) as to a
            
71

    
showing of probable cause, the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and
            
72

    
presenting evidence [as to the existence of the above conditions] that in light of the
            
73

    
considerations listed in Subsection (3)(c), it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor
            
74

    
and the best interests of the public to bind the defendant over to the jurisdiction of the district
            
75

    
court.
            
76

    
    [(d)] (e)  If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that [all the
            
77

    
above conditions are satisfied,] it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor and the
            
78

    
best interests of the public to bind the defendant over to the jurisdiction of the district court, the
            
79

    
court shall so state in its findings and order the minor held for trial as a minor and shall proceed
            
80

    
upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
81

    
    (4)  If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the
            
82

    
state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over
            
83

    
under Subsection (1), the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor
            
84

    
and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
85

    
    (5)  At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue. 
            
86

    
The defendant shall have the same right to bail as any other criminal defendant and shall be
            
87

    
advised of that right by the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court shall set initial bail in
            
88

    
accordance with Title 77, Chapter 20, Bail.
            
89

    
    (6)  If an indictment is returned by a grand jury charging a violation under this section,

            
90


    
the preliminary examination held by the juvenile court judge need not include a finding of
            
91

    
probable cause that the crime alleged in the indictment was committed and that the defendant
            
92

    
committed it, but the juvenile court shall proceed in accordance with this section regarding the
            
93

    
additional considerations listed in Subsection (3)(b).
            
94

    
    (7)  When a defendant is charged with multiple criminal offenses in the same
            
95

    
information or indictment and is bound over to answer in the district court for one or more
            
96

    
charges under this section, other offenses arising from the same criminal episode and any
            
97

    
subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against him shall be considered together with
            
98

    
those charges, and where the court finds probable cause to believe that those crimes have been
            
99

    
committed and that the defendant committed them, the defendant shall also be bound over to
            
100

    
the district court to answer for those charges.
            
101

    
    (8)  When a minor has been bound over to the district court under this section, the
            
102

    
jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Justice Services and the juvenile court over the minor is
            
103

    
terminated regarding that offense, any other offenses arising from the same criminal episode,
            
104

    
and any subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against the minor, except as provided in
            
105

    
Subsection (12).
            
106

    
    (9)  A minor who is bound over to answer as an adult in the district court under this
            
107

    
section or on whom an indictment has been returned by a grand jury is not entitled to a
            
108

    
preliminary examination in the district court.
            
109

    
    (10)  Allegations contained in the indictment or information that the defendant has
            
110

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
111

    
weapon, or is 16 years of age or older, are not elements of the criminal offense and do not need
            
112

    
to be proven at trial in the district court.
            
113

    
    (11)  If a minor enters a plea to, or is found guilty of, any of the charges filed or any
            
114

    
other offense arising from the same criminal episode, the district court retains jurisdiction over
            
115

    
the minor for all purposes, including sentencing.
            
116

    
    (12)  The juvenile court under Section 

78A-6-103

 and the Division of Juvenile Justice
            
117

    
Services regain jurisdiction and any authority previously exercised over the minor when there
            
118

    
is an acquittal, a finding of not guilty, or dismissal of all charges in the district court.
