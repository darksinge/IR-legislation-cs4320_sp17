 Legislative Review Note
    as of  12-17-03  3:07 PM


    Subsections 59-2-924(2)(n)(i) and (ii), as provided in this bill, require the certified tax
rate applicable to certain parts of a county that participates in a police district to be reduced,
resulting in a certified tax rate for that part of the county that is different from the certified tax
rate applicable to other parts of the same county.  That requirement may be subject to challenge
under Subsection (1) of Article XIII, Section 2 of the Utah Constitution, which requires all
property to be "taxed at a uniform and equal rate."
