Protective services authorized in an emergency order may not include hospitalization,                           nursing or custodial care, or a change in residence, unless the court specifically finds that the action                           is necessary and authorizes the specific protective services in the order.                                     Protective services shall be provided through an emergency order for a period not to                           exceed three business days, at which time the order shall expire unless a petition for guardianship,                           conservatorship, or other protective services has been filed.  If a petition for guardianship,                           conservatorship, or other protective services is filed within the three business day period, the                           emergency order may be continued for as long as    days from the date the last petition was filed,                           to allow time for a hearing to determine whether the emergency order shall remain in effect.                                     In its emergency order, the court may appoint the petitioner or another interested                              person as temporary guardian, in accordance with Section                 .

When a vulnerable adult is in need of protective services and the caretaker refuses to                           allow the provision of those services, the division may petition the court for injunctive relief                           prohibiting the caretaker from interfering with the provision of protective services.
