Section  
73-5-15

 is amended to read:
            
1385

    
     73-5-15.  Groundwater management plan.
            
1386

    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
1387

    
    (a)  "Critical management area" means a groundwater basin in which the groundwater
            
1388

    
withdrawals consistently exceed the safe yield.
            
1389

    
    (b)  "Safe yield" means the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a
            
1390

    
groundwater basin over a period of time without exceeding the long-term recharge of the basin
            
1391

    
or unreasonably affecting the basin's physical and chemical integrity.
            
1392

    
    (2) (a)  The state engineer may regulate groundwater withdrawals within a specific
            
1393

    
groundwater basin by adopting a groundwater management plan in accordance with this section
            
1394

    
for any groundwater basin or aquifer or combination of hydrologically connected groundwater
            
1395

    
basins or aquifers.
            
1396

    
    (b)  The objectives of a groundwater management plan are to:
            
1397

    
    (i)  limit groundwater withdrawals to safe yield;
            
1398

    
    (ii)  protect the physical integrity of the aquifer; and
            
1399

    
    (iii)  protect water quality.
            
1400

    
    (c)  The state engineer shall adopt a groundwater management plan for a groundwater
            
1401

    
basin if more than 1/3 of the water right owners in the groundwater basin request that the state

            
1402


    
engineer adopt a groundwater management plan.
            
1403

    
    (3) (a)  In developing a groundwater management plan, the state engineer may consider:
            
1404

    
    (i)  the hydrology of the groundwater basin;
            
1405

    
    (ii)  the physical characteristics of the groundwater basin;
            
1406

    
    (iii)  the relationship between surface water and groundwater, including whether the
            
1407

    
groundwater should be managed in conjunction with hydrologically connected surface waters;
            
1408

    
    (iv)  the geographic spacing and location of groundwater withdrawals;
            
1409

    
    (v)  water quality;
            
1410

    
    (vi)  local well interference; and
            
1411

    
    (vii)  other relevant factors.
            
1412

    
    (b)  The state engineer shall base the provisions of a groundwater management plan on
            
1413

    
the principles of prior appropriation.
            
1414

    
    (c) (i)  The state engineer shall use the best available scientific method to determine
            
1415

    
safe yield.
            
1416

    
    (ii)  As hydrologic conditions change or additional information becomes available, safe
            
1417

    
yield determinations made by the state engineer may be revised by following the procedures
            
1418

    
listed in Subsection (5).
            
1419

    
    (4) (a) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), the withdrawal of water from a
            
1420

    
groundwater basin shall be limited to the basin's safe yield.
            
1421

    
    (ii)  Before limiting withdrawals in a groundwater basin to safe yield, the state engineer
            
1422

    
shall:
            
1423

    
    (A)  determine the groundwater basin's safe yield; and
            
1424

    
    (B)  adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater basin.
            
1425

    
    (iii)  If the state engineer determines that groundwater withdrawals in a groundwater
            
1426

    
basin exceed the safe yield, the state engineer shall regulate groundwater rights in that
            
1427

    
groundwater basin based on the priority date of the water rights under the groundwater
            
1428

    
management plan, unless a voluntary arrangement exists under Subsection (4)(c) that requires a
            
1429

    
different distribution.

            
1430


    
    (b)  When adopting a groundwater management plan for a critical management area, the
            
1431

    
state engineer shall, based on economic and other impacts to an individual water user or a local
            
1432

    
community caused by the implementation of safe yield limits on withdrawals, allow gradual
            
1433

    
implementation of the groundwater management plan.
            
1434

    
    (c) (i)  In consultation with the state engineer, water users in a groundwater basin may
            
1435

    
agree to participate in a voluntary arrangement for managing withdrawals at any time, either
            
1436

    
before or after a determination that groundwater withdrawals exceed the groundwater basin's
            
1437

    
safe yield.
            
1438

    
    (ii)  A voluntary arrangement under Subsection (4)(c)(i) shall be consistent with other
            
1439

    
law.
            
1440

    
    (iii)  The adoption of a voluntary arrangement under this Subsection (4)(c) by less than
            
1441

    
all of the water users in a groundwater basin does not affect the rights of water users who do
            
1442

    
not agree to the voluntary arrangement.
            
1443

    
    (5)  To adopt a groundwater management plan, the state engineer shall:
            
1444

    
    (a)  give notice as specified in Subsection (7) at least 30 days before the first public
            
1445

1454

    
    (ii)  present any data, studies, or reports that the state engineer intends to consider in
            
1455

    (iii)  address safe yield and any other subject that may be included in the groundwater
            
1457
