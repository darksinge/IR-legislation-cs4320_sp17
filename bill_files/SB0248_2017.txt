Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this509     section.510          I. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled511     hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral512     comments received.513          J. If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is514     received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a515     public hearing.516          K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the517     proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking518     record and the full text of the rule.519          L.

A challenge536     shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the537     notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the538     revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the539     Commission.540          SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT541          A. Oversight542          1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member543     state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the544     Compact's purposes and intent.545          2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or546     administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact547     which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.548          3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such549     proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure550     to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the551     Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.552          B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination553          1. If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance554     of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the555     Commission shall:556          a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of557     the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the558     Commission; and559          b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.560          2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated561     from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,562     privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of563     termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or564     liabilities incurred during the period of default.565          3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other566     means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate567     shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the568     defaulting state's Legislature, and each of the member states.569          4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and570     liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend571     beyond the effective date of termination.572          5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in573     default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between574     the Commission and the defaulting state.575          6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S.576     District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its577     principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including578     reasonable attorney's fees.579          C. Dispute Resolution580          1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes581     related to the Compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member582     states.583          2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding584     dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.585          D. Enforcement586          1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the587     provisions and rules of this Compact.588          2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States589     District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its590     principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of591     the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both592     injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing593     member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.594          3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The595     Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.596          SECTION 11. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE597     COMMISSION FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES,598     WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT599          A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is600     enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that601     time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the602     promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers603     necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.604          B. Any state that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of605     the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes606     law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the607     full force and effect of administrative rule on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.608          C. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing609     the same.610          1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after611     enactment of the repealing statute.612          2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's613     physical therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting614     requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.615          D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any616     physical therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state617     and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.618          E. This Compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this619     Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the620     laws of all member states.621          SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY622          This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The623     provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision624     of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United625     States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held626     invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any627     government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall628     be held contrary to the constitution of any party state, the Compact shall remain in full force629     and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state630     affected as to all severable matters.631          Section 4.
