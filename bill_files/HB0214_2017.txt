The report shall be examined and approved by the court.197          (vii)  The guardian shall also render an annual accounting of the status of the person to198     the court which shall be included in the petition or the informal annual report as required under199     Subsection (3)(f).  If a fee is paid for an accounting of an estate, no fee shall be charged for an200     accounting of the status of a person.201          (viii)  If a guardian:202          (A)  makes a substantial misstatement on filings of annual reports;203          (B)  is guilty of gross impropriety in handling the property of the ward; or204          (C)  willfully fails to file the report required by this subsection, after receiving written205     notice from the court of the failure to file and after a grace period of two months has elapsed,206     the court may impose a penalty in an amount not to exceed $5,000.  The court may also order207     restitution of funds misappropriated from the estate of a ward.  The penalty shall be paid by the208     guardian and may not be paid by the estate.209          (ix)  [These] The provisions and penalties in this Subsection (3)(f) governing annual210     reports do not apply if the guardian or a coguardian is the parent of the ward.211          (x)  For the purposes of Subsections (3)(f)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), "interested persons"212     means those persons required to receive notice in guardianship proceedings as set forth in213     Section 75-5-309.214          (g)  If a conservator has been appointed[,]:215          (i)  all of the ward's estate received by the guardian in excess of those funds expended216     to meet current expenses for support, care, and education of the ward shall be paid to the217     conservator for management as provided in this code; and218          (ii)  the guardian shall account to the conservator for funds expended.219          (4) (a)  A court may, in the order of appointment, place specific limitations on the220     guardian's power.221          (b)  A guardian may not prohibit or place restrictions on association with a relative or222     qualified acquaintance of an adult ward, unless permitted by court order under Section223     75-5-312.5.224          (c)  A guardian is not liable to a third person for acts of the guardian's ward solely by225     reason of the relationship described in Subsection (2).226          (5)  Any guardian of one for whom a conservator also has been appointed shall control227     the custody and care of the ward and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for services and for228     room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the229     conservator, if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances.  The guardian230     may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate by payment to third persons or231     institutions for the ward's care and maintenance.232          Section 7.

The estate of the protected person does not include the assets of a trust.238          (2)  The conservator shall provide a copy of the inventory to the protected person if the239     person:240          (a)  can be located;241          (b)  has attained the age of 14 years; and242          (c)  has sufficient mental capacity to understand these matters, and to any parent or243     guardian with whom the protected person resides.244          (3)  The conservator shall keep suitable [administrative] financial records and produce245     them upon the request of any interested person.246          Section 8.

Distributive duties and powers of conservator.347          (1)  A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without348     court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected349     person and [his] the protected person's dependents in accordance with the following principles:350          (a)  The conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard351     of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any.352     [He] A conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually353     furnishing support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations354     of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless [he] the conservator knows that the355     parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any356     personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of357     the protected person.358          (b)  The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the359     support, education, care or benefit of the protected person with due regard to:360          (i)  the size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship and the likelihood361     that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected362     person's affairs and the estate which has been conserved for the protected person;363          (ii)  the accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the364     protected person's household; and365          (iii)  other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.366          (c)  The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally367     dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person's368     household who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support.369          (d)  Funds expended under this Subsection (1) may be paid by the conservator to any370     person, including the protected person to reimburse for expenditures which the conservator371     might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is372     reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or373     reasonably necessary under the circumstances.374          (2)  If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions375     authorized by Subsection (1), a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power376     to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to377     make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year 20% of the income from the estate.378          (3)  When a person who is a minor and who has not been adjudged to have a disability379     under Subsection 75-5-401(2)(a) attains the age of majority, the person's conservator, after380     meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds381     and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.382          (4)  When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person's disability[(], other than383     minority[)], has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of384     administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected385     person as soon as possible.386          (5)  If a protected person dies, the conservator:387          (a)  shall:388          (i)  deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person that389     may have come into the conservator's possession;390          (ii)  inform the [executor] personal representative or a beneficiary named in the will that391     the conservator has done so; and392          (iii)  retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the393     decedent or other persons entitled to it;394          (b)  may continue to pay the obligations lawfully due against the estate and to protect395     the estate from waste, injury, or damages that might reasonably be foreseeable; and396          (c)  may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that the397     conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent's estate without additional or398     further appointment, provided that at least 40 days from the death of the protected person no399     other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for400     appointment is before the court.401          (6)  Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a402     conservator as provided in Subsection (5)(c) and after notice as provided in Section 75-3-310,403     the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection and404     endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and405     that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative.  The406     making and entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment407     of a personal representative as provided in Section 75-3-308 and Chapter 3, Part 6, Personal408     Representative - Appointment, Control, and Termination of Authority, Part 7, Duties and409     Powers of Personal Representatives, Part 8, Creditors' Claims, Part 9, Special Provisions410     Relating to Distribution, and Part 10, Closing Estates, except that the estate in the name of the411     conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors without prior412     retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
