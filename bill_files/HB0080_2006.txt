energy cost savings through the implementation of conservation measures.

    (c)  Principles which produce efficient facility management in the private sector are
            
134

    
equally applicable to the management of public buildings and facilities.

137

    
efficiency improvements due to current budgetary practices.
            
138

order to reduce the operating costs of state government and to set an example of energy
            
143

    
efficiency for the public[.];

    (b)  utilize, to the greatest practical extent, alternative funding sources and methods of

financing energy efficiency improvements in state facilities in a manner which minimizes the
            
146

    
necessity for increased appropriations[.];
