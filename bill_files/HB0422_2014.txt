149

    
the date of delivery of the initial fiscal impact estimate to the local clerk's office, file a petition
            
150

    
with the Supreme Court, alleging that the initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal

impact estimate, taken as a whole, is an inaccurate estimate of the fiscal or legal impact of the

estimated fiscal and legal impact of the initiative.

    (ii)  The Supreme Court may not revise the contents of, or direct the revision of, the
            
158

    
initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal impact estimate, unless the plaintiffs rebut the
            
159

    
presumption by clear and convincing evidence that establishes that the fiscal estimate,
            
160

    
including the legal impact estimate, taken as a whole, is an inaccurate statement of the
            
161

    
estimated fiscal or legal impact of the initiative.
            
162

include a summary statement in the initial fiscal impact statement in substantially the following
            
217

    
form:
            
218

    
    "The (title of the local budget officer) estimates that repealing the law this referendum

220

    
increase or decrease in taxes or debt."
            
221

    
    (ii)  If repealing the law is estimated to have a fiscal impact, the local budget officer

shall include a summary statement in the initial fiscal impact estimate in substantially the
            
223

    
following form:
            
224

    
    "The (title of the local budget officer) estimates that repealing the law this referendum

(type of tax or taxes) tax increase/decrease of $______ and a $______ increase/decrease in
            
227

    
public debt."
            
228

    
    (iii)  If the estimated fiscal impact of repealing the law is highly variable or is otherwise
            
229

    
difficult to reasonably express in a summary statement, the local budget officer may include in
            
230

    
the summary statement a brief explanation that identifies those factors impacting the variability
            
231

    
or difficulty of the estimate.
            
232

    
    (3)  Within 25 calendar days after the day on which the local clerk submits a copy of the
            
233

    
application under Subsection (1), the budget officer shall:
            
234

    
    (a)  deliver a copy of the initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal impact
            
235

    
estimate, to the local clerk's office; and
            
236

    
    (b)  mail a copy of the initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal impact estimate,
            
237

240

    
Supreme Court, alleging that the initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal impact
            
241

    
estimate, taken as a whole, is an inaccurate estimate of the fiscal or legal impact of repealing
            
242

    
the law the referendum proposes to repeal.
            
243

    
    (b) (i)  There is a presumption that the initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal
            
244

    
impact estimate, prepared by the budget officer and legal counsel is based upon reasonable

            
245


    
assumptions, uses reasonable data, and applies accepted analytical methods to present the
            
246

    
estimated fiscal and legal impact of repealing the law the referendum proposes to repeal.
            
247

    
    (ii)  The Supreme Court may not revise the contents of, or direct the revision of, the
            
248

    
initial fiscal impact estimate, including the legal impact estimate, unless the plaintiffs rebut the
            
249

    
presumption by clear and convincing evidence that establishes that the fiscal estimate,
            
250

    
including the legal impact estimate, taken as a whole, is an inaccurate statement of the
            
251

    
estimated fiscal or legal impact of repealing the law the referendum proposes to repeal.
            
252

    
    (iii)  The Supreme Court may refer an issue related to the initial fiscal impact estimate,
            
253

    
including the legal impact estimate, to a master to examine the issue and make a report in
            
254

    
accordance with Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 53.
            
255

    
    (c)  The Supreme Court shall certify to the local clerk an initial fiscal impact estimate,
            
256

    
including the legal impact estimate, for the measure that meets the requirements of this section.
