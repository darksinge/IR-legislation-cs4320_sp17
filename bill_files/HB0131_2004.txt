37

    
    The court, jury or referee must hear such legal evidence as may be offered by any of the
            
38

    
parties to the proceedings, and thereupon must ascertain and assess:
            
39

    
    (1)  the value of the property sought to be condemned and all improvements thereon
            
40

    
appertaining to the realty, and of each and every separate estate or interest therein; and if it
            
41

    
consists of different parcels, the value of each parcel and of each estate or interest therein shall
            
42

    
be separately assessed;
            
43

    
    (2)  if the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a larger parcel, the
            
44

    
damages which will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned by reason of its
            
45

    
severance from the portion sought to be condemned and the construction of the improvement in
            
46

    
the manner proposed by the plaintiff;
            
47

    
    (3)  if the property, though no part thereof is taken, will be damaged by the construction
            
48

    
of the proposed improvement, the amount of such damages;
            
49

    
    (4)  separately, how much the portion not sought to be condemned, and each estate or
            
50

    
interest therein, will be benefited, if at all, by the construction of the improvement proposed by
            
51

    
the plaintiff. If the benefit shall be equal to the damages assessed under Subdivision (2) of this
            
52

    
section, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed no compensation except the value of the
            
53

    
portion taken; but if the benefit shall be less than the damages so assessed, the former shall be
            
54

    
deducted from the latter, and the remainder shall be the only damages allowed in addition to
            
55

    
the value of the portion taken;
            
56

    
    (5)  if the property sought to be condemned consists of water rights or part of a water
            
57

    
delivery system or both, and the taking will cause present or future damage to or impairment of
            
58

    
the water delivery system not being taken, including impairment of the system's carrying

            
59


    
capacity, an amount to compensate for the damage or impairment;
            
60

    
    (6)  if land on which crops are growing at the time of service of summons is sought to
            
61

    
be condemned, the value that those crops would have had after being harvested, taking into
            
62

    
account the expenses that would have been incurred cultivating and harvesting the crops; and
            
63

    
    [(5)] (7)  as far as practicable compensation must be assessed for each source of
            
64

    
damages separately.
