     31A-22-610.1, as last amended by Chapter 329, Laws of Utah 1998
            

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
31A-22-610.1

 is amended to read:
            

    
     31A-22-610.1.  Adoption indemnity benefit.
            

    
    (1) (a)  If an insured has coverage for maternity benefits on the date of an adoptive
            

    
placement, the insured's policy shall provide an adoption indemnity benefit payable to the insured,
            

    
if [the] a child is placed for adoption with the insured within [30] 90 days of the child's birth.
            

    
    (b)  An insurer that has paid the adoption indemnity benefit under Subsection (1)(a) may
            

    
seek reimbursement of the benefit if:
            

    
    (i)  the postplacement evaluation disapproves the adoption placement; and
            

    
    (ii)  a court rules the adoption may not be finalized because of an act or omission of an

uncomplicated birth.

            

    
    (d)  Each insurer shall pay its pro rata share of the adoption indemnity benefit if each
            

    
adoptive parent:
            

    
    (i)  has coverage for maternity benefits with a different insurer; and
