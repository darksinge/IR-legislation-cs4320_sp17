 LONG TITLE
            
8

    
 General Description:
            
9

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature encourages the Utah State Board of Education
            
10

    
and Utah's school districts to consider ways to establish green schools in the state of
            
11

    
Utah.
            
12

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
13

    
    This resolution:
            
14

    
    .    encourages the Utah State Board of Education to consider the broader application of
            
15

    
the design and construction practices for green schools, both for new construction
            
16

    
and major renovation projects undertaken with school district funds; and
            
17

    
    .    encourages school districts to consider seeking application for certification of green
            
18

    
schools under the United States Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and
            
19

    
Environmental Design rating system (LEED), or certification under a comparable
            
20

    
system with requirements at least equivalent to the LEED Silver certification for
            
21

    
new or retrofit construction, or other building performance systems like the United
            
22

    
States Department of Energy's ENERGY STAR Program.
            
23

    
 Special Clauses:
            
24

    
    None
            
25

    

            
26

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
27

    
    WHEREAS, deteriorating school infrastructure and poor indoor environmental quality

            
28


    
threaten the health, well-being, and achievement of students and staff in the state's public
            
29

    
schools;
            
30

    
    WHEREAS, green schools are schools that create a healthy environment that is
            
31

    
conducive to learning, while saving energy, resources, and money;
            
32

    
    WHEREAS, green schools create an environment that supports student learning
            
33

    
through improvements in site selection, daylighting, indoor air quality, thermal comfort,
            
34

    
acoustics, and classroom design, all of which have an impact on a child's ability to learn and a
            
35

    
teacher's ability to teach;
            
36

    
    WHEREAS, the benefits of superior air quality, a key emphasis of green schools, have
            
37

    
been linked to lower asthma rates, fewer allergies, reduced absenteeism, and increased teacher
            
38

    
retention rates;
            
39

    
    WHEREAS, according to the United States Green Buildings Council, green schools
            
40

    
consume an average of 30% to 50% less energy compared to conventional schools;
            
41

    
    WHEREAS, green schools cost less to operate, utilize durable materials, and greatly
            
42

    
reduce water and energy use, which generates significant cost savings;
            
43

    
    WHEREAS, green schools provide an educational experience that transcends the
            
44

    
classroom by creating a host of opportunities for curriculum innovation and hands-on,
            
45

    
project-based learning in which the building itself becomes an interactive teaching tool; and
            
46

    
    WHEREAS, new schools currently under construction are on track to be among the
            
47

    
first energy net-zero K-12 schools in the nation:
            
48

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
49

    
encourages the Utah State Board of Education to consider the broader application of the design
            
50

    
and construction practices for green schools, both for new construction and major renovation
            
51

    
projects undertaken with school district funds.
            
52

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature encourages school districts to
            
53

    
consider seeking application for certification of green schools under the United States Green
            
54

    
Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating system (LEED), or
            
55

    
certification under a comparable system with requirements at least equivalent to the LEED
            
56

    
Silver certification for new or retrofit construction, or other building performance systems like
            
57

    
the United States Department of Energy's ENERGY STAR Program.
            
58

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the United

            
59


    
States Department of Energy, to the United States Green Building Council, to the Utah State
            
60

    
Board of Education, and to the local school boards of the state's 41 school districts.
