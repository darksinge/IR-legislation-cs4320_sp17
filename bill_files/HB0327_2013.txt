    (5) (a)  The person alleged to be incapacitated shall be present at the hearing in person
            
1072

    
and see or hear all evidence bearing upon the person's condition.  If the person seeking the
            
1073

    
guardianship requests a waiver of presence of the person alleged to be incapacitated, the court
            
1074

    
shall order an investigation by a court visitor, the costs of which shall be paid by the person

the guardian has the same powers, rights, and duties respecting the ward that a parent has

respecting the parent's unemancipated minor child except that a guardian is not liable to third

    (a)  To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of
            
1152

    
competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, the guardian is entitled
            
1153

1158

    
reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects and

1161

    
ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service.

    (ii)  receive money and tangible property deliverable to the ward and apply the money
            
1166

    
and property for support, care, and education of the ward; but the guardian may not use funds
            
1167

    
from the ward's estate for room and board which the guardian, the guardian's spouse, parent, or

1175


    
reasonably believes that the ward's death is likely to occur within the next 30 days, based on:

1179

notice of the guardian's intent to move the ward and to serve the notice on all interested persons
            
1182

    
at least 10 days before the move.  The guardian shall take reasonable steps to notify all
            
1183

    
interested persons and to file the notice with the court as soon as practicable following the
            
1184

    
earlier of the move or the date when the guardian's intention to move the ward is made known
            
1185

    
to the ward, the ward's care giver, or any other third party.
            
1186

incurred by the estate.  The guardian shall also report the physical conditions of the ward, the
            
1193

1195

1196

    
shall be approved by the Judicial Council.  This annual report shall be examined and approved
            
1197

    
by the court.  If the ward's income is limited to a federal or state program requiring an annual
            
1198

1199

    
annual report.
            
1200

    
    [(iii)] (vi)  Corporate fiduciaries are not required to petition the court, but shall submit
            
1201

    
their internal report annually to the court.  The report shall be examined and approved by the
            
1202

    
court.
            
1203

    
    [(iv)] (vii)  The guardian shall also render an annual accounting of the status of the
            
1204

    
person to the court which shall be included in the petition or the informal annual report as
            
1205

    
required under Subsection (2)(e).  If a fee is paid for an accounting of an estate, no fee shall be

            
1206


    
charged for an accounting of the status of a person.
            
1207

    
    [(v)] (viii)  If a guardian:
            
1208

    
    (A)  makes a substantial misstatement on filings of annual reports;
            
1209

    
    (B)  is guilty of gross impropriety in handling the property of the ward; or
            
1210

    
    (C)  willfully fails to file the report required by this subsection, after receiving written
            
1211

    
notice from the court of the failure to file and after a grace period of two months has elapsed,
            
1212

    
the court may impose a penalty in an amount not to exceed $5,000.  The court may also order
            
1213

    
restitution of funds misappropriated from the estate of a ward.  The penalty shall be paid by the
            
1214

    
guardian and may not be paid by the estate.
            
1215

    
    [(vi)] (ix)  These provisions and penalties governing annual reports do not apply if the
            
1216

    
guardian is the parent of the ward.
            
1217

    
    (x)  For the purposes of Subsections (2)(e)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), "interested persons"
            
1218

    
means those persons required to receive notice in guardianship proceedings as set forth in
            
1219

    
Section 

75-5-309

.
            
1220

    
    (f)  If a conservator has been appointed, all of the ward's estate received by the guardian
            
1221

    
in excess of those funds expended to meet current expenses for support, care, and education of
            
1222

    
the ward [must] shall be paid to the conservator for management as provided in this code; and
            
1223

    
the guardian [must] shall account to the conservator for funds expended.
            
1224

    
    (3)  Any guardian of one for whom a conservator also has been appointed shall control
            
1225

    
the custody and care of the ward and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for services and for
            
1226

    
room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the
            
1227

    
conservator, if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances.  The guardian
            
1228

    
may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate by payment to third persons or
            
1229

    
institutions for the ward's care and maintenance.
            
1230

    
    Section 23.  
Section  
75-5-407

 is amended to read:
            
1231

    
     75-5-407.  Procedure concerning hearing and order on original petition.
            
1232

    
    (1) Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order
            
1233

    
because of minority, the court shall set a date for the hearing on the matters alleged in the
            
1234

    
petition.  If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the minor
            
1235

    
are or may be inadequately represented, it may appoint an attorney to represent the minor,
            
1236

    
giving consideration to the choice of the minor if 14 years of age or older.  An attorney

            
1237


    
appointed by the court to represent a minor has the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem.
            
1238

    
    (2)  Upon receipt of a petition for appointment of a conservator or other protective order
            
1239

    
for reasons other than minority, the court shall set a date for hearing.  Unless the person to be
            
1240

    
protected has already retained counsel, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the
            
1241

    
person to be protected who then has the powers and duties of a guardian ad litem.
            
1242

    
    (3)  The legal representation of the protected person by an attorney shall terminate upon
            
1243

    
the appointment of a conservator, unless:
            
1244

    
    (a)  there are separate guardianship proceedings still pending before the court
            
1245

    
subsequent to the appointment of a conservator;
            
1246

    
    [(b)  the appointed conservator elects at the time to maintain the attorney's
            
1247

    
representation of the protected person;]
            
1248

    
    [(c)] (b)  there is a timely filed appeal of the appointment of the conservator [or the
            
1249

    
determination of the incapacity]; or
            
1250

    
    [(d)] (c)  upon an express finding of good cause, the court orders otherwise.
            
1251

    
    (4)  If the alleged disability is mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or
            
1252

    
disability, advanced age, chronic use of drugs, or chronic intoxication, the court may direct that
            
1253

    
the person to be protected be examined by a physician designated by the court, preferably a
            
1254

    
physician who is not connected with any institution in which the person is a patient or is
            
1255

    
detained.  The court may send a visitor to interview the person to be protected.  The visitor may
            
1256

    
be a guardian ad litem or an officer or employee of the court.
            
1257

    
    (5)  After hearing, upon finding that a basis for the appointment of a conservator or
            
1258

    
other protective order has been established, the court shall make an appointment or other
            
1259

    
appropriate protective order.
