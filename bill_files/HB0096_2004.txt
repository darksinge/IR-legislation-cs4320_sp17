Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

23

    
     78-12-21.5.  Actions related to improvements in real property.
            
24

    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
25

    
    (a)  "Abandonment" means that there has been no design or construction activity on the
            
26

    
improvement for a continuous period of one year.
            
27

    
    (b)  "Action" means any claim for judicial, arbitral, or administrative relief for acts,

            
28


    
errors, omissions, or breach of duty arising out of or related to the design, construction, or
            
29

    
installation of an improvement, whether based in tort, contract, warranty, strict liability,
            
30

    
indemnity, contribution, or other source of law.
            
31

    
    (c)  "Completion of improvement" means the date of substantial completion of an
            
32

    
improvement to real property as established by the earliest of:
            
33

    
    (i)  a Certificate of Substantial Completion;

    (iii)  the date of first use or possession of the improvement.
            
36

    
    (d)  "Improvement" means any building, structure, infrastructure, road, utility, or other
            
37

    
similar man-made change, addition, modification, or alteration to real property.
            
38

    
    (e)  "Person" means an individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
            
39

    
joint venture, association, proprietorship, or any other legal or governmental entity.
            
40

    
    (f)  "Provider" means any person contributing to, providing, or performing studies,

44

    
    (2)  The Legislature finds that:
            
45

    
    (a)  exposing a provider to suits and liability for acts, errors, omissions, or breach of
            
46

    
duty after the possibility of injury or damage has become highly remote and unexpectedly
            
47

    
creates costs and hardships to the provider and the citizens of the state;
            
48

    
    (b)  these costs and hardships include liability insurance costs, records storage costs,
            
49

    
undue and unlimited liability risks during the life of both a provider and an improvement, and
            
50

    
difficulties in defending against claims many years after completion of an improvement;
            
51

    
    (c)  these costs and hardships constitute clear social and economic evils;
            
52

    
    (d)  the possibility of injury and damage becomes highly remote and unexpected ten
            
53

    
years following completion or abandonment; and
            
54

    
    (e)  except as provided in Subsection (7), it is in the best interests of the citizens of the
            
55

    
state to impose the periods of limitation and repose provided in this chapter upon all causes of
            
56

    
action by or against a provider arising out of or related to the design, construction, or
            
57

    
installation of an improvement.
            
58

    
    (3) (a)  An action by or against a provider based in contract or warranty shall be

            
59


    
commenced within six years of the date of completion of the improvement or abandonment of
            
60

    
construction.  Where an express contract or warranty establishes a different period of
            
61

    
limitations, the action shall be initiated within that limitations period.
            
62

    
    (b) All other actions by or against a provider shall be commenced within two years
            
63

    
from the earlier of the date of discovery of a cause of action or the date upon which a cause of
            
64

    
action should have been discovered through reasonable diligence.  If the cause of action is
            
65

    
discovered or discoverable before completion of the improvement or abandonment of

67

    
    (4)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3)(b), an action may not be commenced against a
            
68

    
provider more than [12] six years after completion of the improvement or abandonment of
            
69

    
construction.  In the event the cause of action is discovered or discoverable in the [eleventh or
            
70

    
twelfth] seventh or eighth year of the [12] six-year period, the injured person shall have two
            
71

    
additional years from that date to commence an action.
            
72

    
    (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply to an action against a provider:
            
73

    
    (a)  who has fraudulently concealed his act, error, omission, or breach of duty, or the
            
74

    
injury, damage, or other loss caused by his act, error, omission, or breach of duty; or
            
75

    
    (b)  for a willful or intentional act, error, omission, or breach of duty.
            
76

    
    (6)  If a person otherwise entitled to bring an action did not commence the action within
            
77

    
the periods prescribed by Subsections (3) and (4) solely because that person was a minor or
            
78

    
mentally incompetent and without a legal guardian, that person shall have two years from the
            
79

    
date the disability is removed to commence the action.
            
80

    
    (7)  This section shall not apply to an action for the death of or bodily injury to an
            
81

    
individual while engaged in the design, installation, or construction of an improvement.
            
82

    
    (8)  The time limitation imposed by this section shall not apply to any action against
            
83

    
any person in actual possession or control of the improvement as owner, tenant, or otherwise,
            
84

    
at the time any defective or unsafe condition of the improvement proximately causes the injury
            
85

    
for which the action is brought.
            
86

    
    (9)  This section does not extend the period of limitation or repose otherwise prescribed
            
87

    
by law or a valid and enforceable contract.
            
88

    
    (10)  This section does not create or modify any claim or cause of action.
            
89

    
    (11)  This section applies to all causes of action that accrue after May 3, [1998] 2003,

            
90


    
notwithstanding that the improvement was completed or abandoned before May 3, [1999]
            
91

    
2004.
