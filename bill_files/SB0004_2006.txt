    The Laboratory performs a variety of tests under contract and in volume to
other agencies of government.  The charge for these services is determined
according to the type of services and the test volume, and is based on the cost
to the Laboratory and therefore may be lower than the fee schedule.  Because

of changing needs, the Laboratory receives requests for new tests or services
that are impossible to anticipate and list fully in a standard fee schedule. 
Charges for these services are authorized and are to be based on costs.

 Children with Special Health Care Needs
Note:
    The schedule of charges for Children with Special Health Care Needs
services provided by the Division of Community and Family Health Services
represents commonly performed procedures by CPT code and is consistent
with charges by the private sector.  The list is not intended to be
comprehensive as the Division is mandated to assign a charge for all services
performed and there is potentially an unlimited number of procedures that
could be provided.  If unlisted services are performed, charges consistent with
the private sector will be assigned.

    The Division assigns a charge to all services performed regardless of the
client's or third party insurer's financial responsibility or the likelihood of
receiving payment for the services.  Projected numbers of units of services are
based on past experiences but are subject to significant variation determined
by the actual needs of patients and changes in medical practices.  Hence, it is
not possible to calculate the change in revenue resulting from a change in the
charge for a given service.

Leases and Easements - Resulting in Long-Term Uses of Habitat:
    Fees shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the division, using the
estimated fair market value of the property, or other legislatively established
fees, whichever is greater, plus the cost of administering the lease,
right-of-way, or easement.  Fair market value shall be determined by
customary market valuation practices.
Special Use Permits (for non-depleting land uses of less than one year):
    A nonrefundable application of $50 shall be assessed for any commercial
use.  Fees for approved special uses will be based on the fair market value of
the use, determined by customary practices which may include: an assessment
of comparable values for similar properties, comparable fees for similar land
uses, or fee schedules.  If more than one fee determination applies, the highest
fee will be selected.
