30

    
may acquire, purchase or lease all or any part of any water, waterworks system, water supply or
            
31

    
property connected therewith, and whenever the governing body of a city or town shall deem it
            
32

    
necessary for the public good such city or town may bring condemnation proceedings to
            
33

    
acquire the same; provided, that if within thirty days after the passage and publication of a
            
34

    
resolution or ordinance for the purchase or lease or condemnation herein provided for one-third
            
35

    (3)  In determining just compensation in a condemnation proceeding under this section
            
43

    
where a determination of market value of what is proposed to be taken is impractical because
            
44

    
there is no meaningful market for what is proposed to be taken, the value shall be presumed to
            
45

    
be the amount the owner paid to acquire ownership of what is proposed to be taken, as adjusted

47

    
equitably bearing on the value of what is proposed to be taken.
            
48

50

    
holdings.
