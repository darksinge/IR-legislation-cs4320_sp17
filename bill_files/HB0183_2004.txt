Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

    (1)  Upon arrest for domestic violence, a person may not be released on bail,
            
29

    
recognizance, or otherwise prior to the close of the next court day following the arrest, unless
            
30

    
as a condition of that release he is ordered by the court or agrees in writing that until the
            
31

    
expiration of that time he will:
            
32

    
    (a)  have no personal contact with the alleged victim;
            
33

    
    (b)  not threaten or harass the alleged victim; and
            
34

    
    (c)  not knowingly enter onto the premises of the alleged victim's residence or any
            
35

    
premises temporarily occupied by the alleged victim.
            
36

    
    (2)  As a condition of release, the court may order the defendant to participate in an
            
37

    
electronic monitoring program and pay the costs associated with the program.
            
38

    
    (3) (a)  Subsequent to an arrest for domestic violence, an alleged victim may waive in
            
39

    
writing any or all of the requirements described in Subsection (1).  Upon waiver, those
            
40

    
requirements shall not apply to the alleged perpetrator.
            
41

    
    (b)  A court or magistrate may modify the requirements described in Subsections (1)(a)
            
42

    
or (c), in writing or on the record, and only for good cause shown.
            
43

    
    (4) (a)  Whenever a person is released pursuant to Subsection (1), the releasing agency
            
44

    
shall  notify the arresting law enforcement agency of the release, conditions of release, and any
            
45

    
available information concerning the location of the victim.  The arresting law enforcement
            
46

    
agency shall then make reasonable effort to notify the victim of that release.
            
47

    
    (b) (i)  When a person is released pursuant to Subsection (1) based on a written
            
48

49

    
violence network described in Section 

30-6-8

.
            
50

    
    (ii)  When a person is released pursuant to Subsection (1) based upon a court order, the
            
51

    
court shall transmit that order to the statewide domestic violence network described in Section
            
52

    

30-6-8

.
            
53

    
    (c)  This Subsection (4) does not create or increase liability of a law enforcement officer
            
54

    
or agency, and the good faith immunity provided by Section 

77-36-8

 is applicable.
            
55

    
    (5) (a)  If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person has
            
56

    
violated a court order or agreement executed pursuant to Subsection (1) the officer shall,
            
57

    
without a warrant, arrest the alleged violator.
            
58

    
    (b)  Any person who knowingly violates a court order or agreement executed pursuant

            
59


    
to Subsection (1) shall be guilty as follows:
            
60

    
    (i)  if the original arrest was for a felony, an offense under this section is a third degree
            
61

    
felony; or
            
62

    
    (ii)  if the original arrest was for a misdemeanor, an offense under this section is a class
            
63

    
A misdemeanor.
            
64

    
    (c)  City attorneys may prosecute class A misdemeanor violations under this section.
            
65

    
    (6)  An individual who was originally arrested for a felony under this chapter and
            
66

    
released pursuant to this section may subsequently be held without bail if there is substantial
            
67

    
evidence to support a new felony charge against him.
            
68

    
    (7)  At the time an arrest for domestic violence is made, the arresting officer shall
            
69

    
provide [both] the alleged victim [and the alleged perpetrator] with written notice containing
            
70

    
the following information:
            
71

    
    (a)  the requirements described in Subsection (1), and notice that those requirements
            
72

    
shall be ordered by a court or must be agreed to by the alleged perpetrator prior to release;
            
73

    
    (b)  notification of the penalties for violation of the court order or any agreement
            
74

    
executed under Subsection (1);
            
75

    
    (c)  the date and time, absent modification by a court or magistrate, that the
            
76

    
requirements expire;
            
77

    
    (d)  the address of the appropriate court in the district or county in which the alleged
            
78

    
victim resides;
            
79

    
    (e)  the availability and effect of any waiver of the requirements; and
            
80

    
    (f)  information regarding the availability of and procedures for obtaining civil and
            
81

    
criminal protective orders with or without the assistance of an attorney.
            
82

    
    (8)  At the time an arrest for domestic violence is made, the arresting officer shall
            
83

    
provide the alleged perpetrator with written notice containing the following information:
            
84

    
    (a)  the requirements described in Subsection (1) and notice that those requirements
            
85

    
shall be ordered by a court or must be agreed to by the alleged perpetrator prior to release;
            
86

    
    (b)  notification of the penalties for violation of the court or any agreement executed
            
87

    
under Subsection (1); and
            
88

    
    (c)  the date and time absent modification by a court or magistrate that the requirements
            
89

    
expire.

            
90


    
    [(8)] (9)  In addition to the provisions of Subsections (1) through (6), because of the
            
91

    
unique and highly emotional nature of domestic violence crimes, the high recidivism rate of
            
92

    
violent offenders, and the demonstrated increased risk of continued acts of violence subsequent
            
93

    
to the release of an offender who has been arrested for domestic violence, it is the finding of
            
94

    
the Legislature that domestic violence crimes, as defined in Section 

77-36-1

, are crimes for
            
95

    
which bail may be denied if there is substantial evidence to support the charge, and if the court
            
96

    
finds by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged perpetrator would constitute a
            
97

    
substantial danger to an alleged victim of domestic violence if released on bail.  If bail is
            
98

    
denied under this Subsection [(8)] (9), it shall be under the terms and conditions described in
            
99

    
Subsections (1) through (6).
