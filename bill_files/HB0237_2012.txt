allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice
            
793

    
that the person physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited the child, that fact
            
794

797

    
reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the
            
798

    
child's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued
            
799

    
removal.
            
800

    
    (ii)  If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child's
            
801

    
parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with
            
802

    
the child's parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.

            
803


    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (10)(a), and in ordering and

    (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency
            
807

    
situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that
            
808

    
any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
809

    
    (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe
            
810

    
abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make

813

    
offending parent or parents.

820

    
state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
821

    
    (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for
            
822

    
the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if the child were returned home,
            
823

    
the court shall order continued removal regardless of:
            
824

    
    (a)  any error in the initial removal of the child;

the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:
            
893

    
    (a)  establish a primary permanency goal for the minor; and
            
894

    
    (b)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency goal, reunification services
            
895

    
are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsections (20) through (22).

            
896


    
    (3)  Subject to Subsections (6) and (7), if the court determines that reunification
            
897

    
services are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for
            
898

    
reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,

    (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe
            
901

concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.

    (6)  For purposes of Subsection (3), parent-time is in the best interests of a minor unless
            
907

    
the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:
            
908

    
    (a)  protect the physical safety of the minor;

    (b)  protect the life of the minor; or

minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.
            
912

    
    (7)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), a court may not deny parent-time based solely on a

    (a)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or

917

    
permanency goal that shall include:
            
918

925

    
goal.
            
926

    
    (10) (a)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency goal before the

.

929

    
that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.

931

    
permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section
            
932

    

78A-6-314

78A-6-314

, ends.

939

    
parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.
            
940

    
    (b)  In providing the services described in Subsection (11)(a), the minor's health, safety,

and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.
            
942

    
    (12)  The court shall:
            
943

    
    (a)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child

and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;
            
945

    
    (b)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family
            
946

950

    
federal law.

953

    
extended under Subsection 

78A-6-314

(8).
            
954

    
    (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12
            
955

    
months of reunification services.
            
956

    
    (14) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at
            
957

    
any time.

            
958


    
    (b)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined
            
959

    
to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section
            
960

    

78A-6-314

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:

    (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
965

    
described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.

    (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
967

removal of the minor.
            
971

    
    (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted

    (17)  With regard to a minor who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the minor
            
974

    
is initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
975

    
    (a)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
976

    
pursuant to Section 

78A-6-314

; and
            
977

    
    (b)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
978

    
removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts
            
979

    
to comply with the child and family plan.
            
980

    
    (18)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are
            
981

    
ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six
            
982

    
months from the date that reunification services were ordered:
            
983

    
    (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and
            
984

    
    (b)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.
            
985

    
    (19)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section
            
986

    

78A-6-314

, the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the
            
987

    
sibling group together is:
            
988

    
    (a)  practicable; and

            
989


    
    (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.
            
990

    
    (20) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
991

    
permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
992

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.
            
993

    
    (b)  The court may determine that:
            
994

    
    (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,
            
995

    
based on the individual circumstances; and
            
996

    
    (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.
            
997

    
    (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in
            
998

    
making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount
            
999

    
concern.
            
1000

    
    (21)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
1001

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
1002

    
circumstances exist:
            
1003

    
    (a)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
1004

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
1005

    
    (b)  subject to Subsection (22)(a), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such
            
1006

    
magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;
            
1007

    
    (c)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,
            
1008

    
sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:
            
1009

    
    (i)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;
            
1010

    
    (ii)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and
            
1011

    
    (iii)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual
            
1012

    
exploitation;
            
1013

    
    (d)  the parent:
            
1014

    
    (i)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect; [or]
            
1015

    
    (ii)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:
            
1016

    
    (A)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or
            
1017

    
    (B)  child abuse homicide;
            
1018

    
    (iii)  committed sexual abuse against the child; or
            
1019

    
    (iv)  is a registered sex offender;

            
1020


    
    (e)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
1021

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
1022

    
minor;
            
1023

    
    (f)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,
            
1024

    
and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the
            
1025

    
offending parent;
            
1026

    
    (g)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;
            
1027

    
    (h)  the minor is removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions and
            
1028

    
reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;
            
1029

    
    (i)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;
            
1030

    
    (j)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a
            
1031

    
location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation
            
1032

    
was located;
            
1033

    
    (k)  except as provided in Subsection (22)(b), with respect to a parent who is the child's
            
1034

    
birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or was
            
1035

    
exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child's mother while the child
            
1036

    
was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the mother
            
1037

    
agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a
            
1038

    
substance abuse treatment program approved by the department; or
            
1039

    
    (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
1040

    
efforts or services.
            
1041

    
    (22) (a)  The finding under Subsection (21)(b) shall be based on competent evidence
            
1042

    
from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing
            
1043

    
that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately
            
1044

    
caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is made.
            
1045

    
    (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection (21)(k) if the court finds, under
            
1046

    
the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection
            
1047

    
(21)(k) is not warranted.
            
1048

    
    (23)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take
            
1049

    
into consideration:
            
1050

    
    (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child

            
1051


    
and family plan;
            
1052

    
    (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of
            
1053

    
drugs or alcohol;
            
1054

    
    (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family
            
1055

    
member;
            
1056

    
    (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;
            
1057

    
    (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;
            
1058

    
    (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
1059

    
successful; and
            
1060

    
    (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.
            
1061

    
    (24) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections (20) through
            
1062

    
(22), and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which
            
1063

    
the out-of-home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide
            
1064

    
reunification services.
            
1065

    
    (b)  The time limits described in Subsections (2) through (19) are not tolled by the
            
1066

    
parent's absence.
            
1067

    
    (25) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
1068

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.
            
1069

    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (25)(a), the court shall
            
1070

    
consider:
            
1071

    
    (i)  the age of the minor;

    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;
            
1073

    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence;
            
1074

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment;
            
1075

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;
            
1076

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;
            
1077

    
    (vii)  for a minor 10 years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the
            
1078

    
implementation of family reunification services; and
            
1079

    (c)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations
            
1081

    
imposed in Subsections (2) through (19).

    (d)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time
            
1083

    
limitations imposed in Subsections (2) through (19), unless the court determines that continued
            
1084

    
reunification services would be in the minor's best interest.
            
1085

    
    (26)  If, pursuant to Subsections (21)(b) through (l), the court does not order

1099

    
agency or the division for adoption; or
            
1100

    
    (b)  make any other disposition of the child authorized under Section

    (a)  shall determine whether there is a relative who desires to adopt the child; and
            
1106

    
    (b)  may order the division to conduct a reasonable search to determine whether there

    (6)  This section does not guarantee that a relative will be permitted to adopt the child.
            
1115

1118

    
foster parents, in accordance with Section 

78B-6-132
