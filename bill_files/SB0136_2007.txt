143

    
    (v)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(b)(iv), the court may allow a period of up to 72
            
144

    
hours for the posting of the counter bond.
            
145

    
    (vi)  The court shall approve the bond in an amount that is the probable amount of costs
            
146

    
of suit, including attorney fees and actual damages that may result to the plaintiff if the
            
147

    
defendant has improperly withheld possession.
            
148

    
    (vii)  The court shall consider prepaid rent to the owner as a portion of the defendant's
            
149

    (4)  If the defendant demands a hearing under Subsection (2)(c), and if the court rules
            
158

    
after the hearing that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the property, the constable or
            
159

    
sheriff shall promptly return possession of the property to the plaintiff.  If at the hearing the
            
160

    
court allows the defendant to remain in possession and further issues remain to be adjudicated
            
161

    
between the parties, the court shall require the defendant to post a bond as required in
            
162
