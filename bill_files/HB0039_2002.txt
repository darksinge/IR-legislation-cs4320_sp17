Section                 is amended to read                                         .  Offenses for which prosecution may be commenced at any time.

As used in this section                                 a    Active concealment  means conduct of the defendant that is designed to prevent                          discovery of the offense or of the defendant s involvement in the offense.  Mere silence, inaction,                          or nondisclosure does not constitute active concealment.                                b    Final  means                                 i   all appeals have been exhausted                                 ii   no judicial review is pending  and                                   iii   no application for judicial review is pending.

If the defendant has entered into a plea agreement with the prosecution and later                           successfully moves to invalidate his conviction, the period of limitation is suspended from the time                           of the entry of the plea pursuant to the plea agreement until the time at which the conviction is                           determined to be invalid, and that determination becomes final.                                     For purposes of this section,  final  means                                   a   all appeals have been exhausted                                   b   no judicial review is pending  and                                  c   no application for judicial review is pending.                                     When the period of limitation is suspended pursuant to Subsection          , the                           suspension includes any charges to which the defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea                           agreement, charges which were dismissed as a result of a plea agreement, as well as any known                           charges which were not barred at the time of entry of the plea.                                    Notwithstanding any other limitation, a prosecution may be commenced for charges                           described in Subsection     within one year after a plea entered pursuant to a plea agreement has                           been determined to be invalid, and that determination becomes final.
