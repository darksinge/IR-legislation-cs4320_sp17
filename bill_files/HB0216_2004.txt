 Legislative Review Note
    as of  10-6-03  2:17 PM


This bill regulates Internet businesses who provide services to Utah residents.  Case law
surrounding regulation of Internet activities is evolving.  State regulations of Internet activities
have been challenged for violating principles such as the Commerce Clause of the United
States Constitution.  Some courts have indicated that the need for national uniformity might
limit a state's ability to regulate Internet activities.  Other court rulings indicate that regulations
like those contained in this bill could be upheld because the regulations do not impose a greater
burden on out of state Internet businesses than is imposed on in state Internet businesses and
regulate only service that is provided to Utah residents.
