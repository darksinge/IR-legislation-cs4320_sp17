No forfeiture may be imposed under Subsection     c  if, at the time the forfeiture                            action is commenced, the person was in compliance with the commissioner s order, or if the                            violation of the order occurred during the order s suspension.

Exemptions.                                       The commissioner may by rule exempt from any or all of the provisions of this chapter                                  a   any person ,                                  b   a class of persons ,   or                                 c   a market segment  from any or all of the provisions of this chapter.  This .                                     The exemption described in Subsection     shall be given only if and to the extent that                            the commissioner finds the application of the provisions of this chapter to that person or group is                            unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter.

Rates may not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory , nor may an insurer                           charge any rate which, if continued, may have the effect of destroying competition or creating a                           monopoly .                                     a   Rates are not excessive if a reasonable degree of price competition exists at the                            consumer level with respect to the class of business to which they apply.  In determining whether                            a reasonable degree of price competition exists, the commissioner shall consider  all                                   i   relevant tests  including   of workable competition pertaining to                                  A   market structure                                  B   market performance  and                                 C   market conduct  and                                 ii   the practical opportunities  available to consumers in the market to                                  A   acquire pricing and other consumer information  and                                 B   compare and obtain insurance from competing insurers.                                 b   The tests described in Subsection     a  include                                  i   the size and number of insurers actively engaged in the market and class of business                                  ii    their  the market shares of insurers actively engaged in the market and changes in                              market shares                                  iii   the existence of rate differentials in that class of business                                  iv   ease of entry and latent competition of insurers capable of easy entry .                                   v   whether the profitability of companies generally in the market segment is unreasonably                           high                                  vi   availability of consumer information concerning the product and sales outlets or other                           sales mechanisms  and                                 vii   efforts of insurers to provide consumer information.                                  b    c   If reasonable price competition does not exist, rates are excessive if  they                                   i   rates are likely to produce a long term profit that is unreasonably high in relation to the                            riskiness of the class of business ,   or  if                                  ii   expenses are unreasonably high in relation to the services rendered.                                     Rates are inadequate if                                  a   they are clearly insufficient, when combined with the investment income attributable                            to them, to sustain the projected losses and expenses in the class of business to which they apply .                             and                                 b   the use of such rates has or, if continued, will have                                  i   the effect of substantially lessening competition  or                                 ii   the tendency to create a monopoly in any market.                                     a   A rate is unfairly discriminatory  in relation to another rate in the same class if it                           clearly fails  if price differentials fail to equitably reflect the differences in expected losses and                            expenses .  Rates are  after allowing for practical limitations.                                 b   A rate is not unfairly discriminatory  because different premiums result for                           policyholders with similar loss exposures but different expense factors, or similar expense factors                           but different loss exposures, so long as the rates reflect the differences with reasonable accuracy.                            Rates are not unfairly discriminatory if they are  if it is averaged broadly among persons insured                            under a                                  i   group, franchise, or blanket policy  or                                 ii   mass marketed plan.
