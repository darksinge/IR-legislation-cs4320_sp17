63

    
    (i)  the employee sustained a significant impairment or combination of impairments as a

    (ii)  the employee has a permanent, total disability; and

163

    
law judge shall order:
            
164

    
    (i)  the initiation of permanent total disability compensation payments to provide for the
            
165

    
employee's subsistence; and
            
166

    
    (ii)  the payment of any undisputed disability or medical benefits due the employee.
            
167

    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (5)(a), an order for payment of benefits described in
            
168

    
Subsection (5)(b) is considered a final order for purposes of Section 

34A-2-212


.
            
169

    
    (d)  The employer or its insurance carrier shall be given credit for any disability
            
170

    
payments made under Subsection (5)(b) against its ultimate disability compensation liability
            
171

    
under this chapter or Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act.
            
172

    
    (e)  An employer or its insurance carrier may not be ordered to submit a reemployment
            
173

    
plan.  If the employer or its insurance carrier voluntarily submits a plan, the plan is subject to
            
174

    
Subsections (5)(e)(i) through (iii).
            
175

    
    (i)  The plan may include, but not require an employee to pay for:
            
176

    
    (A)  retraining;
            
177

    
    (B)  education;
            
178

    
    (C)  medical and disability compensation benefits;
            
179

    
    (D)  job placement services; or

182

    
for the employee's subsistence during the rehabilitation process.

            
183


    
    (iii)  The employer or its insurance carrier shall diligently pursue the reemployment
            
184

    
plan.  The employer's or insurance carrier's failure to diligently pursue the reemployment plan
            
185

    
is cause for the administrative law judge on the administrative law judge's own motion to make
            
186

    
a final decision of permanent total disability.
            
187

    
    (f)  If a preponderance of the evidence shows that successful rehabilitation is not
            
188

    
possible, the administrative law judge shall order that the employee be paid weekly permanent
            
189

    
total disability compensation benefits.
            
190

    
    (g)  If a preponderance of the evidence shows that pursuant to a reemployment plan, as
            
191

    
prepared by a qualified rehabilitation provider and presented under Subsection (5)(e), an
            
192

    
employee could immediately or without unreasonable delay return to work but for the
            
193

    
following, an administrative law judge shall order that the employee be denied the payment of
            
194

    
weekly permanent total disability compensation benefits:
            
195

    
    (i)  incarceration in a facility operated by or contracting with a federal, state, county, or
            
196

    
municipal government to house a criminal offender in either a secure or nonsecure setting; or
            
197

    
    (ii)  not being legally eligible to be employed because of a reason unrelated to the
            
198

    
impairment or combination of impairments.
            
199

    
    (6) (a)  The period of benefits commences on the date the employee acquired the
            
200

    
permanent, total disability, as determined by a final order of the commission based on the facts
            
201

    
and evidence, and ends:
            
202

    
    (i)  with the death of the employee; or
            
203

    
    (ii)  when the employee is capable of returning to regular, steady work.
            
204

    
    (b)  An employer or its insurance carrier may provide or locate for a permanently totally
            
205

    
disabled employee reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work in a job earning at least
            
206

    
minimum wage, except that the employee may not be required to accept the work to the extent
            
207

    
that it would disqualify the employee from Social Security disability benefits.
            
208

    
    (c)  An employee shall:
            
209

    
    (i)  fully cooperate in the placement and employment process; and
            
210

    
    (ii)  accept the reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work.
            
211

    
    (d)  In a consecutive four-week period when an employee's gross income from the work
            
212

    
provided under Subsection (6)(b) exceeds $500, the employer or insurance carrier may reduce
            
213

    
the employee's permanent total disability compensation by 50% of the employee's income in

            
214


    
excess of $500.
            
215

    
    (e)  If a work opportunity is not provided by the employer or its insurance carrier, an
            
216

    
employee with a permanent, total disability may obtain medically appropriate, part-time work
            
217

    
subject to the offset provisions of Subsection (6)(d).
            
218

    
    (f) (i)  The commission shall establish rules regarding the part-time work and offset.
            
219

    
    (ii)  The adjudication of disputes arising under this Subsection (6) is governed by Part
            
220

    
8, Adjudication.
            
221

    
    (g)  The employer or its insurance carrier has the burden of proof to show that
            
222

    
medically appropriate part-time work is available.
            
223

    
    (h)  The administrative law judge may:
            
224

    
    (i)  excuse an employee from participation in any work:
            
225

    
    (A)  that would require the employee to undertake work exceeding the employee's:
            
226

    
    (I)  medical capacity; or
            
227

    
    (II)  residual functional capacity; or
            
228

    
    (B)  for good cause; or
            
229

    
    (ii)  allow the employer or its insurance carrier to reduce permanent total disability
            
230

    
benefits as provided in Subsection (6)(d) when reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time
            
231

    
work is offered, but the employee fails to fully cooperate.
            
232

    
    (7)  When an employee is rehabilitated or the employee's rehabilitation is possible but
            
233

    
the employee has some loss of bodily function, the award shall be for permanent partial
            
234

    
disability.
            
235

    
    (8)  As determined by an administrative law judge, an employee is not entitled to
            
236

    
disability compensation, unless the employee fully cooperates with any evaluation or
            
237

    
reemployment plan under this chapter or Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act.  The
            
238

    
administrative law judge shall dismiss without prejudice the claim for benefits of an employee
            
239

    
if the administrative law judge finds that the employee fails to fully cooperate, unless the
            
240

    
administrative law judge states specific findings on the record justifying dismissal with
            
241

    
prejudice.
            
242

    
    (9) (a)  The loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of the following constitutes
            
243

    
total and permanent disability that is compensated according to this section:

    (i)  both hands;

248

    
    (v)  both eyes; or
            
249

    
    (vi)  any combination of two body members described in this Subsection (9)(a).
            
250

    
    (b)  A finding of permanent total disability pursuant to Subsection (9)(a) is final.
            
251

    
    (10) (a)  An insurer or self-insured employer may periodically reexamine a permanent
            
252

    
total disability claim, except those based on Subsection (9), for which the insurer or
            
253

    
self-insured employer had or has payment responsibility to determine whether the employee
            
254

    
continues to have a permanent, total disability.
            
255

    
    (b)  Reexamination may be conducted no more than once every three years after an
            
256

    
award is final, unless good cause is shown by the employer or its insurance carrier to allow
            
257

    
more frequent reexaminations.
            
258

    
    (c)  The reexamination may include:
            
259

    
    (i)  the review of medical records;
            
260

    
    (ii)  employee submission to one or more reasonable medical evaluations;
            
261

    
    (iii)  employee submission to one or more reasonable rehabilitation evaluations and
            
262

    
retraining efforts;
            
263

    
    (iv)  employee disclosure of Federal Income Tax Returns;
            
264

    
    (v)  employee certification of compliance with Section 

34A-2-110


; and
            
265

    
    (vi)  employee completion of one or more sworn affidavits or questionnaires approved
            
266

    
by the division.
            
267

    
    (d)  The insurer or self-insured employer shall pay for the cost of a reexamination with
            
268

    
appropriate employee reimbursement pursuant to rule for reasonable travel allowance and per
            
269

    
diem as well as reasonable expert witness fees incurred by the employee in supporting the
            
270

    
employee's claim for permanent total disability benefits at the time of reexamination.
            
271

    
    (e)  If an employee fails to fully cooperate in the reasonable reexamination of a
            
272

    
permanent total disability finding, an administrative law judge may order the suspension of the
            
273

    
employee's permanent total disability benefits until the employee cooperates with the
            
274

    
reexamination.
            
275

    
    (f) (i)  If the reexamination of a permanent total disability finding reveals evidence that

            
276


    
reasonably raises the issue of an employee's continued entitlement to permanent total disability
            
277

    
compensation benefits, an insurer or self-insured employer may petition the Division of
            
278

    
Adjudication for a rehearing on that issue.  The insurer or self-insured employer shall include
            
279

    
with the petition, documentation supporting the insurer's or self-insured employer's belief that
            
280

    
the employee no longer has a permanent, total disability.
            
281

    
    (ii)  If the petition under Subsection (10)(f)(i) demonstrates good cause, as determined
            
282

    
by the Division of Adjudication, an administrative law judge shall adjudicate the issue at a
            
283

    
hearing.
            
284

    
    (iii)  Evidence of an employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time work
            
285

    
may not be the sole basis for termination of an employee's permanent total disability
            
286

    
entitlement, but the evidence of the employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time
            
287

    
work under Subsection (6) may be considered in the reexamination or hearing with other
            
288

    
evidence relating to the employee's status and condition.
            
289

    
    (g)  In accordance with Section 

34A-1-309


, the administrative law judge may award
            
290

    
reasonable attorney fees to an attorney retained by an employee to represent the employee's
            
291

    
interests with respect to reexamination of the permanent total disability finding, except if the
            
292

    
employee does not prevail, the attorney fees shall be set at $1,000.  The attorney fees awarded
            
293

    
shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier in addition to the permanent total
            
294

    
disability compensation benefits due.
            
295

    
    (h)  During the period of reexamination or adjudication, if the employee fully
            
296

    
cooperates, each insurer, self-insured employer, or the Employers' Reinsurance Fund shall
            
297

    
continue to pay the permanent total disability compensation benefits due the employee.
            
298

    
    (11)  If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision to any person
