    (b)  A recorder shall abstract an instrument in the tract index unless:
            
81

    
    (i)  the instrument is required to contain a legal description under Section 

17-21-20


 or

 and does not contain that legal description; or
            
83

84

    
parcel to which the instrument relates cannot be determined.

index that is required by this section despite errors, omissions, or defects in the instrument.
            
96

    
    (f)  The fact that a recorded instrument described in Subsection (3)(e) is included in the
            
97

    
tract index does not cure a failure to give public notice caused by an error, omission, or defect.

    (g)  A document that is indexed in all or part of the indexes required by this section
