be accompanied by:
            
106

    
    (a)  a certificate of a licensed physician or a designated examiner stating that within a

127

    
authority or in a temporary emergency facility as provided in Section 

62A-15-634

128

examination, a local mental health authority or its designee shall report to the court, orally or in

62A-15-625

, and whether treatment
            
132

133

    
the court may, without taking any further action, terminate the proceedings and dismiss the
            
134

    
application.  In any event, if the examiner reports orally, the examiner shall immediately send

the allegations of the application and any reported facts, together with a copy of any official
            
138

    
order of detention, shall be provided by the court to a proposed patient before, or upon,
            
139

140

    
presently in the custody of a local mental health authority whose status is being changed from
            
141

    
voluntary to involuntary, upon the filing of an application for that purpose with the court.  A
            
142

    
copy of that order of detention shall be maintained at the place of detention.
            
143

    
    (5)  Notice of commencement of those proceedings shall be provided by the court as
            
144

    
soon as practicable to the applicant, any legal guardian, any immediate adult family members,
            
145

    
legal counsel for the parties involved, and any other persons whom the proposed patient or the
            
146

    
court shall designate.  That notice shall advise those persons that a hearing may be held within
            
147

    
the time provided by law.  If the patient has refused to permit release of information necessary
            
148

149

    
court.

    (6)  Proceedings for commitment of an individual under the age of 18 years to the

accordance with the provisions of Part 7, Commitment of Persons Under Age 18 to Division of
            
153

154

    
    (7)  The district court may, in its discretion, transfer the case to any other district court
            
155

    
within this state, provided that the transfer will not be adverse to the interest of the proposed
            
156

    
patient.
            
157

    
    (8) (a)  Within 24 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, of the
            
158

    
issuance of a judicial order, or after commitment  of a proposed patient to a local mental health
            
159

    
authority under court order for detention or examination, the court shall appoint two designated
            
160

    
examiners to examine the proposed patient.  If requested by the proposed patient's counsel, the
            
161

    
court shall appoint, as one of the examiners, a reasonably available qualified person designated
            
162

    
by counsel.  The examinations, to be conducted separately, shall be held at the home of the
            
163

    
proposed patient, a hospital or other medical facility, or at any other suitable place that is not
            
164

    
likely to have a harmful effect on the patient's health.
            
165

    
    (b)  The examiner shall inform the patient if not represented by an attorney that, if
            
166

    
desired, the patient does not have to say anything, the nature and reasons for the examination,
            
167

    
that it was ordered by the court, that any information volunteered could form part of the basis
            
168

    
for his or her involuntary commitment, and that findings resulting from the examination will be
            
169

    
made available to the court.
            
170

    
    (c)  A time shall be set for a hearing to be held within 10 calendar days of the
            
171

    
appointment of the designated examiners, unless those examiners or a local mental health
            
172

    
authority or its designee informs the court prior to that hearing date that the patient is not
            
173

    
mentally ill, that the patient has agreed to become a voluntary patient under Section
            
174

    

62A-15-625

, or that treatment programs are available and acceptable without court
            
175

    
proceedings, in which event the court may, without taking any further action, terminate the
            
176

    
proceedings and dismiss the application.
            
177

    
    (9) (a)  Before the hearing, an opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be
            
178

    
afforded to every proposed patient, and if neither the patient nor others provide counsel, the
            
179

    
court shall appoint counsel and allow counsel sufficient time to consult with the patient before
            
180

    
the hearing.  In the case of an indigent patient, the payment of reasonable attorney fees for
            
181

    
counsel, as determined by the court, shall be made by the county in which the patient resides or
            
182

    
was found.

            
183


    
    (b)  The proposed patient, the applicant, and all other persons to whom notice is
            
184

    
required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to
            
185

    
present and cross-examine witnesses.  The court may, in its discretion, receive the testimony of
            
186

    
any other person.  The court may allow a waiver of the patient's right to appear only for good
            
187

    
cause shown, and that cause shall be made a matter of court record.
            
188

    
    (c)  The court is authorized to exclude all persons not necessary for the conduct of the
            
189

    
proceedings and may, upon motion of counsel, require the testimony of each examiner to be
            
190

    
given out of the presence of any other examiners.
            
191

    
    (d)  The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with
            
192

    
orderly procedure, and in a physical setting that is not likely to have a harmful effect on the
            
193

    
mental health of the proposed patient.
            
194

    
    (e)  The court shall consider all relevant historical and material information which is
            
195

    
offered, subject to the rules of evidence, including reliable hearsay under Rule 1102, Utah
            
196

    
Rules of Evidence.
            
197

    
    (f) (i)  A local mental health authority or its designee, or the physician in charge of the
            
198

    
patient's care shall, at the time of the hearing, provide the court with the following information:
            
199

    
    (A)  the detention order;
            
200

    
    (B)  admission notes;
            
201

    
    (C)  the diagnosis;
            
202

    
    (D)  any doctors' orders;
            
203

    
    (E)  progress notes;
            
204

    
    (F)  nursing notes; and
            
205

    
    (G)  medication records pertaining to the current commitment.
            
206

    
    (ii)  That information shall also be supplied to the patient's counsel at the time of the
            
207

    
hearing, and at any time prior to the hearing upon request.
            
208

    
    (10)  The court shall order commitment of an individual who is 18 years of age or older
            
209

    
to a local mental health authority if, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the
            
210

    
information presented in accordance with Subsection (9)(e), the court finds by clear and
            
211

    
convincing evidence that:
            
212

    
    (a)  the proposed patient has a mental illness;
            
213

    
    (b)  because of the proposed patient's mental illness the proposed patient poses a

            
214


    
substantial danger, as defined in Section 

62A-15-602

, [of physical injury] to self or others,
            
215

    
which may include the inability to provide the basic necessities of life such as food, clothing,
            
216

    
and shelter, if allowed to remain at liberty;
            
217

    
    (c)  the patient lacks the ability to engage in a rational decision-making process
            
218

    
regarding the acceptance of mental treatment as demonstrated by evidence of inability to weigh
            
219

    
the possible risks of accepting or rejecting treatment;
            
220

    
    (d)  there is no appropriate less-restrictive alternative to a court order of commitment;
            
221

    
and
            
222

    
    (e)  the local mental health authority can provide the individual with treatment that is
            
223

    
adequate and appropriate to the individual's conditions and needs.  In the absence of the
            
224

    
required findings of the court after the hearing, the court shall forthwith dismiss the
            
225

    
proceedings.
            
226

    
    (11) (a)  The order of commitment shall designate the period for which the individual
            
227

    
shall be treated.  When the individual is not under an order of commitment at the time of the
            
228

    
hearing, that period may not exceed six months without benefit of a review hearing.  Upon
            
229

    
such a review hearing, to be commenced prior to the expiration of the previous order, an order
            
230

    
for commitment may be for an indeterminate period, if the court finds by clear and convincing
            
231

    
evidence that the required conditions in Subsection (10) will last for an indeterminate period.
            
232

    
    (b)  The court shall maintain a current list of all patients under its order of commitment. 
            
233

    
That list shall be reviewed to determine those patients who have been under an order of
            
234

    
commitment for the designated period.  At least two weeks prior to the expiration of the
            
235

    
designated period of any order of commitment still in effect, the court that entered the original
            
236

    
order shall inform the appropriate local mental health authority or its designee.  The local
            
237

    
mental health authority or its designee shall immediately reexamine the reasons upon which the
            
238

    
order of commitment was based.  If the local mental health authority or its designee determines
            
239

    
that the conditions justifying that commitment no longer exist, it shall discharge the patient
            
240

    
from involuntary commitment and immediately report that to the court.  Otherwise, the court
            
241

    
shall immediately appoint two designated examiners and proceed under Subsections (8)
            
242

    
through (10).
            
243

    
    (c)  The local mental health authority or its designee responsible for the care of a patient
            
244

    
under an order of commitment for an indeterminate period, shall at six-month intervals

            
245


    
reexamine the reasons upon which the order of indeterminate commitment was based.  If the
            
246

    
local mental health authority or its designee determines that the conditions justifying that
            
247

    
commitment no longer exist, that local mental health authority or its designee shall discharge
            
248

    
the patient from its custody and immediately report the discharge to the court.  If the local
            
249

    
mental health authority or its designee determines that the conditions justifying that
            
250

    
commitment continue to exist, the local mental health authority or its designee shall send a
            
251

    
written report of those findings to the court.  The patient and his counsel of record shall be
            
252

    
notified in writing that the involuntary commitment will be continued, the reasons for that
            
253

    
decision, and that the patient has the right to a review hearing by making a request to the court. 
            
254

    
Upon receiving the request, the court shall immediately appoint two designated examiners and
            
255

    
proceed under Subsections (8) through (10).
            
256

    
    (12)  In the event that the designated examiners are unable, because a proposed patient
            
257

    
refuses to submit to an examination, to complete that examination on the first attempt, the
            
258

    
court shall fix a reasonable compensation to be paid to those designated examiners for their
            
259

    
services.
            
260

    
    (13)  Any person committed as a result of an original hearing or a person's legally
            
261

    
designated representative who is aggrieved by the findings, conclusions, and order of the court
            
262

    
entered in the original hearing has the right to a new hearing upon a petition filed with the court
            
263

    
within 30 days of the entry of the court order.  The petition must allege error or mistake in the
            
264

    
findings, in which case the court shall appoint three impartial designated examiners previously
            
265

    
unrelated to the case to conduct an additional examination of the patient.  The new hearing
            
266

    
shall, in all other respects, be conducted in the manner otherwise permitted.
            
267

    
    (14)  Costs of all proceedings under this section shall be paid by the county in which the
            
268

    
proposed patient resides or is found.
