Section         a         is amended to read                                      a    .  Preservation of assets.                                     At  Prior to or at the time a criminal information, indictment charging a violation,                           or a petition alleging delinquency is filed, or at any time during the prosecution of the case, a                           prosecutor may, if in the prosecutor s best judgment there is a substantial likelihood that a                          conviction will be obtained and restitution will be ordered in the case, petition the court to                                 a   enter a temporary restraining order  or , an injunction, or both                                 b   require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond ,   or                                c   take any other action to preserve the availability of property which may be                           necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution order  if, in the prosecutor s best judgement, there                          is a substantial likelihood that a conviction will be obtained and restitution will be ordered .                                 a   Upon receiving a petition from a prosecutor under this Subsection    , and after                          notice and a hearing, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution                          of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any action necessary to preserve the availability of                          property which may be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution order.                                  b   An order entered under this Subsection     is effective for up to    days, unless                          extended by the court for good cause shown.                                      Prior to the filing of a criminal information, indictment charging a violation, or a                          petition alleging delinquency, a prosecutor may petition the court to enter a restraining order or                          injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to                          preserve the availability of property which may be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution                          order if, in the prosecutor s best judgement, there is a substantial likelihood that a conviction                          will be obtained and restitution will be ordered.                                     a   Upon receiving a request from a prosecutor under  this  Subsection     ,     ,                          and after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and affording them an                          opportunity to be heard, the court may  enter a restraining order or injunction, require the                          execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any action necessary to preserve the                          availability of property which may be necessary to satisfy an anticipated restitution order after                          notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and affording them an                          opportunity to be heard,  take action as requested by the prosecutor if the court determines                            that                                     i   there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the                           defendant committed it, and that failure to enter the order will likely result in the property                           being sold, distributed, exhibited, destroyed, or removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or                           otherwise be made unavailable for restitution  and                                ii   the need to preserve the availability of the property or prevent its sale, distribution,                           exhibition, destruction, or removal through the entry of the requested order outweighs the                           hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.                                b   In a hearing conducted pursuant to this section, a court may consider reliable                          hearsay as defined in Utah Rules of Evidence, Rule     .                                 b    c   An order for an injunction entered under this  Subsection      section is                           effective for the period of time given in the order.                                    a   Upon receiving a request for a temporary restraining order from a prosecutor                           under  Subsection    , and notwithstanding Subsection     a  i   this section, a court may enter                           a temporary restraining order against an owner with respect to specific property without notice                           or opportunity for a hearing if                                 i   the prosecutor demonstrates that there is a substantial likelihood that the property                           with respect to which the order is sought appears to be necessary to satisfy an anticipated                           restitution order under this chapter  and                                ii    that  provision of notice would jeopardize the availability of the property to satisfy                           any restitution order or judgment.                                b   The temporary order in this Subsection     expires not more than ten days after it is                           entered unless extended for good cause shown or the party against whom it is entered consents                           to an extension.                                    A hearing concerning an order entered under this section shall be held as soon as                           possible, and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.
