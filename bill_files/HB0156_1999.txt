No more than    days after a child enters the temporary custody of the division, the                           child s treatment plan shall be finalized.                                    The division shall use an interdisciplinary team approach in developing each treatment                           plan.  An interdisciplinary team shall include, but is not limited to, representatives from mental                           health, education, and, where appropriate, a representative of law enforcement.                                    The division shall involve all of the following in the development of a child s treatment                              plan                                 a   both of the child s natural parents, unless the whereabouts of a parent are unknown                                 b   the child                                 c   the child s foster parents  and                                d   where appropriate, the child s step parent.                                    A copy of the treatment plan shall be provided to the guardian ad litem, and to the                           child s natural parents and foster parents.                                    Each treatment plan shall specifically provide for the safety of the child, in accordance                           with federal law, and clearly define what actions or precautions will, or may be, necessary to                           provide for the health, safety, protection, and welfare of the child.                                    The plan shall set forth, with specificity, at least the following                                 a   the reason the child entered Division of Child and Family Services custody, and                           documentation of the reasonable efforts made to prevent placement or documentation of the                           emergency situation that existed and that prevented reasonable efforts                                 b   the primary permanency goal for the child and the reason for selection of that goal                                 c   the concurrent permanency goal for the child and the reason for the selection of that                          goal                                  c    d   if the plan is for the child to return to his family, specifically what the parents                           must do in order to enable the child to be returned home, specifically how those requirements may                           be accomplished, and how those requirements will be measured                                  d    e   the specific services needed to reduce the problems that necessitated placement                           in the division s custody, and who will provide for and be responsible for case management                                  e    f   a visitation schedule between the natural parent and the child                                  f    g   the health care to be provided to the child, and the mental health care to be                           provided to address any known or diagnosed mental health needs of the child.  If residential                           treatment, rather than a foster home, is the proposed placement, a specialized assessment of the                           child s health needs shall be conducted, including an assessment of mental illness and behavior and                           conduct disorders  and                                 g    h   social summaries that include case history information pertinent to case planning.                                    a   The treatment plan shall be specific to each child and his family, rather than                           general.  The division shall train its workers to develop treatment plans that comply with federal                              mandates and the specific needs of the particular child and his family                                 b   all treatment plans and expectations shall be individualized and contain specific time                           frames                                 c   treatment plans shall address problems that keep children in placement and keep them                           from achieving permanence in their lives  and                                d   the child s natural parents, foster parents, and where appropriate, step parents, shall be                           kept informed of and supported to participate in important meetings and procedures related to the                           child s placement.                                    With regard to a child who is three years of age or younger, if the goal is not to return                           the child home, the permanency plan for that child shall be adoption unless there are extenuating                           circumstances that justify long term foster care or guardianship.                               Section  .    Section        a         is amended to read                                     a    .  Dispositional hearing    Reunification services    Exceptions.                                    The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section         a        , place the                           child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency, order                           protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or other services.                                    a  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that                           the minor remain in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, it shall first establish                          a primary permanency goal for the minor and determine whether, in view of the primary                          permanency goal, reunification services are appropriate for the child and the child s family,                           pursuant to Subsection    .  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical                           abuse or neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                           efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to attempt to                           rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  In all cases, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall                           be the court s paramount concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be                           made.                                b   i   In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a concurrent                          permanency goal.  The concurrent permanency goal shall include a representative list of the                          conditions under which the primary permanency goal will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent                          permanency goal and an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary                          permanency goal.                                   ii   A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection                                 a            b  within    days if something other than reunification is initially established as a                          child s primary permanency goal.                                iii   The court may amend a child s primary permanency goal before the establishment of                          a final permanency plan under Section         a        .  The court is not limited to the terms of the                          concurrent permanency goal in the event that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.  If, at                          anytime, the court determines that reunification is no longer a child s primary permanency goal,                          the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section         a         within the                          earlier of    days of the court s determination or    months from the original removal of the child.                                 b    c   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order                            that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and his parent for the                            purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time. In providing those                            services, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern, and the                            court shall so order.  The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from                            the date that the child was initially removed from his home.  Nothing in this section may be                            construed to entitle any parent to an entire    months of reunification services.  If reunification                            services have been ordered, the court may terminate those services at any time.  If, at any time,                            continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to be inconsistent with the final                            permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection         a       , then measures shall                            be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan, and to                            complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.                                  c    d   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period                            described in Subsection   b       c  does not interrupt the running of the period.                                  d    e   i   If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be                            conducted by the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time period                            for reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the                            original removal of the child.                                  ii   If reunification services have not been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be                            conducted within    days, in accordance with Section         a        .                                  e    f   With regard to a child who is two years of age or younger at the time the court                            orders reunification services, the court shall order the discontinuance of those services after six                               months if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to comply with the treatment plan.                             The burden is upon the parents, and the division if it supports continued reunification services, to                            show that the parents have made substantial efforts to comply with the plan during the first six                            months of reunification services.                                  f    g   With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have                            been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period of                            six months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate                            reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                                     a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                            permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a                            parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may, under any                            circumstances, determine that efforts to reunify a child with his family are not reasonable or                            appropriate, based on the individual circumstances, and that reunification services should not be                            provided.  In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a child, and in making                             reasonable efforts,  the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern.                                 b   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a parent                            if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following circumstances exist                                  i   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit indicating                            that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                  ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders him                            incapable of utilizing reunification services  that finding shall be based on competent evidence                            from mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent                            is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within    months                                  iii   the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or sexual                            abuse, that following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of his parent, was                            subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the minor is being removed due to                            additional physical or sexual abuse                                  iv   the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has                            committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder or manslaughter                            of a child or child abuse homicide                                  v   the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the                               parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the minor                                  vi   the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the                            parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with                            the offending parent                                  vii   the parent s rights have been terminated with regard to any other child                                  viii   the child has been removed from his home on at least two previous occasions and                            reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times  or                                 ix   the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer  or                                 x   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification efforts                            or services.                                     a   Failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with any previous                            treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs                            or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, whether a parent continues to live with an individual                            who abused the child, any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the child to repeated                            abuse, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be                            successful, shall be considered in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.                                 b   The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in                            reunification with the child, in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.                                     If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a , and the                            whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the                            minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits                            described in Subsection    , however, are not tolled by the parent s absence.                                     If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services                            unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.  In determining                            detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent child bonding, the                            length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of                            detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for minors ten years of age or older, the                            minor s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other                            appropriate factors.  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the    month                            limitation imposed in Subsection    .  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are                            subject to the    month limitation imposed in Subsection    , unless the court determines that                               continued reunification services would be in the child s best interest.                                     If, pursuant to Subsection     b  ii ,  iii ,  iv , v ,  vi ,  vii ,  viii ,  ix , or  x , the court                            does not order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within                                    days, in accordance with Section         a        .                                Section  .    Section        a         is amended to read                                      a    .  Permanency hearing    Final plan    Petition for termination of parental                            rights filed    Hearing on termination of parental rights.                                     a   When reunification services have been ordered in accordance with Section                                 a        , with regard to a child who is in the custody of the Division of Child and Family                            Services, a permanency hearing shall be held by the court no later than    months after the original                            removal of the child.                                 b   When no reunification services were ordered at the dispositional hearing, a permanency                            hearing shall be held within    days from the date of the dispositional hearing.                                     a   If reunification services were ordered by the court in accordance with Section                                 a        , the court shall, at the permanency hearing, determine whether the child may safely be                            returned to the custody of his parent.  If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that                            return of the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child s physical or emotional                            well being, the child may not be returned to the custody of his parent.  The failure of a parent or                            guardian to participate in, comply with, in whole or in part, or to meet the goals of a court                            approved treatment plan constitutes prima facie evidence that return of the child to that parent                            would create a substantial risk of detriment.                                 b   In making a determination under this Subsection    , the court shall review the report                            prepared by the Division of Child and Family Services, a report prepared by the child s guardian                            ad litem, any report prepared by a foster care citizen review board pursuant to Section         g        ,                            any evidence regarding the efforts or progress demonstrated by the parent, and the extent to which                            the parent cooperated and availed himself of services provided.                                     a  With regard to a case where reunification services were ordered by the court, if a                            child is not returned to his parent or guardian at the permanency hearing, the court shall order                            termination of reunification services to the parent, and make a final determination regarding                            whether termination of parental rights, adoption, guardianship, or long term foster care is the most                            appropriate final plan for the child, taking into account the child s primary permanency goal                              established by the court pursuant to Section         a       .  If the child clearly desires contact with the                            parent, the court shall take the child s desire into consideration in determining the final plan.   In                           addition, the court shall establish a concurrent plan that identifies the second most appropriate final                           plan for the child.  The court may not extend reunification services beyond    months from the                            date the child was initially removed from his home, in accordance with the provisions of Section                                 a        , except that the court may extend reunification services for no more than    days if it                            finds that there has been substantial compliance with the treatment plan, that reunification is                            probable within that    day period, and that the extension is in the best interest of the child.  In no                            event may any reunification services extend beyond    months from the date the child was initially                            removed from his home.  Delay or failure of a parent to establish paternity or seek custody does                            not provide a basis for the court to extend services for that parent beyond that    month period.                                 b   The court may, in its discretion, enter any additional order that it determines to be in                            the best interest of the child, so long as that order does not conflict with the requirements and                            provisions of Subsection     a .  The court may order the division to provide protective supervision                            or other services to a child and the child s family after the division s custody of a child has been                            terminated.                                     If the final plan for the child is to proceed toward termination of parental rights, the                            petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed, and a pretrial held, within    calendar days                            after the permanency hearing.                                     Any party to an action may, at any time, petition the court for an expedited permanency                            hearing on the basis that continuation of reunification efforts are inconsistent with the permanency                            needs of the child.  If the court so determines, it shall order, in accordance with federal law, that                            the child be placed in accordance with the permanency plan, and that whatever steps are necessary                            to finalize the permanent placement of the child be completed as quickly as possible.                                     Nothing in this section may be construed to                                  a   entitle any parent to reunification services for any specified period of time                                  b   limit a court s ability to terminate reunification services at any time prior to a                            permanency hearing  or                                 c   limit or prohibit the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights by any party,                            or a hearing on termination of parental rights, at any time prior to a permanency hearing.  If a                            petition for termination of parental rights is filed prior to the date scheduled for a permanency                               hearing, the court may schedule the hearing on termination of parental rights in lieu of the                            permanency hearing  combine the permanency hearing and the hearing on termination of parental                            rights  or schedule the hearings separately.  If the court schedules the hearing on termination of                            parental rights in lieu of the permanency hearing, any reunification services shall be terminated in                            accordance with the time lines described in Section         a         and a decision on the petition for                            termination of parental rights shall be made within    months from the date of the child s removal.
