    (1)  The Legislature finds that the rights and interests of all parties affected by an

adoption proceeding must be considered and balanced in determining what constitutional
            
108

    
protections and processes are necessary and appropriate.
            
109

    
    (2)  The Legislature finds that:

    (a)  the state has a compelling interest in providing stable and permanent homes for
            
111

    
adoptive children in a prompt manner, in preventing the disruption of adoptive placements, and
            
112

    
in holding parents accountable for meeting the needs of children;
            
113

    
    (b)  an unmarried mother, faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions

protection only when he demonstrates a timely and full commitment to the responsibilities of
            
122

    
parenthood, both during pregnancy and upon the child's birth.  The state has a compelling
            
123

    
interest in requiring unmarried biological fathers to demonstrate that commitment by providing
            
124

    
appropriate medical care and financial support and by establishing legal paternity, in
            
125

    
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.

78-30-1.1

(5) and] Sections 78-30-4.12 through

78-30-4.21

, the Legislature prescribes the  conditions for determining whether an unmarried
            
128

    
biological father's action is sufficiently prompt and substantial to require constitutional
            
129

    
protection.
            
130

    
    (b)  If an unmarried biological father fails to grasp the opportunities to establish a
            
131

    
relationship with his child that are available to him, his biological parental interest may be lost
            
132

    
entirely, or greatly diminished in constitutional significance by his failure to timely exercise it,
            
133

    
or by his failure to strictly comply with the available legal steps to substantiate it.
            
134

    
    (c)  A certain degree of finality is necessary in order to facilitate the state's compelling
            
135

    
interest.  The Legislature finds that the interests of the state, the mother, the child, and the
            
136

    
adoptive parents described in this section outweigh the interest of an unmarried biological
            
137

    
father who does not timely grasp the opportunity to establish and demonstrate a relationship
            
138

    
with his child in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
            
139

    
    (d)  An unmarried biological father has the primary responsibility to protect his rights.
            
140

    
    (e)  An unmarried biological father is presumed to know that the child may be adopted
            
141

    
without his consent unless he strictly complies with the provisions of this chapter, manifests a
            
142

    
prompt and full commitment to his parental responsibilities, and establishes paternity.
            
143

    
    (4)  The Legislature finds that an unmarried mother has a right of privacy with regard to
            
144

    
her pregnancy and adoption plan, and therefore has no legal obligation to disclose the identity
            
145

    
of an unmarried biological father prior to or during an adoption proceeding, and has no
            
146

    
obligation to volunteer information to the court with respect to the father.
            
147

    
    Section 4.

    (b)  both parents or the surviving parent of an adoptee who was conceived or born

within a marriage;
            
155

    
    (c)  the mother of an adoptee born outside of marriage;
            
156

    
    (d)  any biological parent who has been adjudicated to be the child's biological father by
            
157

    
a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the mother's execution of consent to adoption or her
            
158

    
relinquishment of the child for adoption;
            
159

    
    (e)  consistent with Subsection (3), any biological parent who has executed and filed a

    (2) (a)  The consent of a person described in Subsections (1)(b) through (g) is not
            
169

170

    
    (b)  The consent of a person described in Subsections (1)(b) through (f) is not required
            
171

    
if the person's parental rights relating to the adoptee have been terminated.
            
172

    
    (3)  For purposes of Subsection (1)(e), a voluntary declaration of paternity is considered
            
173

    
filed when it is entered into a database that:
            
174

    
    (a)  can be accessed by the Department of Health; and
            
175

    
    (b)  is designated by the state registrar of vital statistics as the official database for
            
176

    
voluntary declarations of paternity.
            
177

    
    (4)  Except as provided in Subsections (5)(a) and (10), and consistent with Subsection
            
178

    
(8), with regard to a child who is placed with adoptive parents more than six months after birth,

    (a) (i)  developed a substantial relationship with the child by:
            
181

    
    (A)  visiting the child monthly, unless the unmarried biological father was physically or

financially unable to visit the child on a monthly basis; or

            
183


    
    (B)  engaging in regular communication with the child or with the person or authorized
            
184

    
agency that has lawful custody of the child;
            
185

    
    (ii)  took some measure of responsibility for the child and the child's future; and
            
186

    
    (iii)  demonstrated a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by financial

    (6)  Except as provided in Subsections (8) and (10), with regard to a child who is six

207

208

    
    (a)  initiates proceedings to establish paternity under Title 78, Chapter 45g, Utah
            
209

    
Uniform Parentage Act;

    (ii)  he was prevented from paying the expenses by the person or authorized agency

.
            
238

    
    (9)  Unless the adoptee is conceived or born within a marriage, the petitioner in an

    (a)  that a diligent search has been made of the registry of notices from unmarried
            
242

    
biological fathers described in Subsection (6)(c); and
            
243

    
    (b) (i)  that no filing has been found pertaining to the father of the child in question; or

    (10)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections (4) and (6), the consent of an
            
246

    
unmarried biological father, with respect to an adoptee who is under the age of 18, is required
            
247

    
if:
            
248

    
    (a) (i)  the unmarried biological father did not know, and through the exercise of
            
249

    
reasonable diligence could not have known, that the child or the child's mother were present in
            
250

    
the state of Utah at any time during the period of time beginning at the conception of the child
            
251

    
and ending at the time the mother executed a consent to adoption or relinquishment of the child
            
252

    
for adoption; and
            
253

    
    (ii)  before the mother executed a consent to adoption or relinquishment of the child for
            
254

    
adoption, the unmarried biological father fully complied with the requirements to establish
            
255

    
parental rights in the child, and to preserve the right to notice of a proceeding in connection
            
256

    
with the adoption of the child, imposed by:
            
257

    
    (A)  the last state where the unmarried biological father knew, or through the exercise

262

    
diligence should have known, that the child or the child's mother were present in the state of
            
263

    
Utah at any time during the period of time beginning at the conception of the child and ending

adoption; and
            
266

    
    (ii)  the unmarried biological father complied with the requirements of Subsection (4)

    (A)  20 days after the day that the unmarried biological father knew, and through the
            
269

    
exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that the child or the child's mother were
            
270

    
present in the state of Utah; or

272

    
child for adoption.
            
273

    
    (11)  An unmarried biological father who does not fully and strictly comply with the
            
274

    
requirements of this section is considered to have waived and surrendered any right in relation
            
275

    
to the child, including the right to:

            
276


    
    (a)  notice of any judicial proceeding in connection with the adoption of the child; and
            
277

278

    
    Section 5.  
Section  
78-30-4.15

 is amended to read:
            
279

    
     78-30-4.15.  Responsibility of each party for own actions -- Fraud or
            
280

    
 misrepresentation.
            
281

    
    (1)  Each parent of a child conceived or born outside of marriage is responsible for his
            
282

    
or her own actions and is not excused from strict compliance with the provisions of this 
            
283

    
chapter based upon any action, statement, or omission of the other parent or third parties.
            
284

    
    (2)  Any person injured by fraudulent representations or actions in connection with an
            
285

    
adoption is entitled to pursue civil or criminal penalties in accordance with existing law.  A
            
286

    
fraudulent representation is not a defense to strict compliance with the requirements of this
            
287

    
chapter, and is not a basis for dismissal of a petition for adoption, vacation of an adoption
            
288

    
decree, or an automatic grant of custody to the offended party.  Custody determinations shall be
            
289

    
based on the best interest of the child, in accordance with the provisions of Section 

78-30-4.16

.
            
290

    
    (3)  The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or
            
291

    
misrepresentation in adoption proceedings, and has provided a method for absolute protection
            
292

    
of an unmarried biological father's rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  In
            
293

    
balancing the rights and interests of the state, and of all parties affected by fraud, specifically
            
294

    
the child, the adoptive parents, and the unmarried biological father, the Legislature has
            
295

    
determined that the unmarried biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate
            
296

    
the effects of fraud and that, therefore, the burden of fraud shall be borne by him.
            
297

    
    [(4)  The Legislature finds that an unmarried biological father who resides in another
            
298

    
state may not, in every circumstance, be reasonably presumed to know of, and strictly comply
            
299

    
with, the requirements of this chapter.  Therefore when all of the following requirements have
            
300

    
been met, that unmarried biological father may contest an adoption, prior to finalization of the
            
301

    
decree of adoption, and assert his interest in the child; the court may then, in its discretion,
            
302

    
proceed with an evidentiary hearing under Subsection 

78-30-4.16

(2):]
            
303

    
    [(a)  the unmarried biological father resides and has resided in another state where the
            
304

    
unmarried mother was also located or resided;]
            
305

    
    [(b)  the mother left that state without notifying or informing the unmarried biological
            
306

    
father that she could be located in the state of Utah;]

            
307


    
    [(c)  the unmarried biological father has, through every reasonable means, attempted to
            
308

    
locate the mother but does not know or have reason to know that the mother is residing in the
            
309

    
state of Utah; and]
            
310

    
    [(d)  the unmarried biological father has complied with the most stringent and complete
            
311

    
requirements of the state where the mother previously resided or was located, in order to
            
312

    
protect and preserve his parental interest and right in the child in cases of adoption.]
