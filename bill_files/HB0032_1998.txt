 Legislative Review Note
    as of  12-22-97  12:48 PM


This bill raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns:

    This bill is patterned after disclosure laws enacted in other states.  The disclosure law of
one state, Massachusetts, has been challenged in court on the grounds that it:  (1) is preempted by
federal law; (2) results in the taking of a trade secret without just compensation in violation of state
and federal constitutions; and (3) imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. 
This bill, if challenged on similar grounds, would likely be upheld.
    The preemption challenge has been litigated and rejected in the Massachusetts Federal
District Court and  the First Circuit Court of Appeals.  Phillip Morris, Inc. v. Massachusetts, 1997
U.S. Dist. Lexis 2091 (Mass. D. C. 1997), aff'd, 122 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 1997).  While this ruling
may not be conclusively binding on a Utah Federal District Court or the Tenth Circuit Court of
Appeals if this bill were challenged on preemption grounds, it is directly on point and creates

- 7 -

favorable precedence.
    The trade secret and interstate commerce challenges to Massachusetts' disclosure law have
not been fully resolved, although the district court has issued an order preventing the enforcement
of the law until full resolution occurs.  Even without the benefit of a court decision directly on
point, it seems likely that this bill would successfully withstand a challenge on either ground if an
action were brought.
    First, the bill would likely withstand a trade secret challenge because disclosure is limited
to a nicotine yield rating and five known tobacco ingredients.  More importantly, no disclosure is
required for any unknown tobacco ingredient, which a manufacturer may have a financial interest
in keeping secret from competitors, or for any formula, pattern, method, technique, or process for
producing a cigarette or tobacco product.  See generally, Carson Products Company v. Califano,
594 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1979); Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides v. Browner, 941
F. Supp. 197 (D.D.C. 1996); Mobay Chemical Corp. v. Costle, 517 F. Supp. 254 (W.D. Pa. 1981).
    Second, the bill would likely withstand an interstate commerce challenge because the
regulation of tobacco products comes within the State's general health and safety powers, the bill
is not a protectionist measure aimed at discriminating against interstate commerce, and disclosure,
by itself, is not a unique or unreasonably heavy burden on interstate commerce.  See generally
Manufacturers Ass'n of Tri-County v. Knepper, 623 F. Supp. 1066 (M.D. Pa. 1985), aff'd in part
and rev'd on other grounds, 801 F.2d 130 (3d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 815 (1987); Ohio
Manufacturers Ass'n v. City of Akron, 628 F. Supp. 623 (N.D. Ohio 1986) rev'd on other grounds,
801 F.2d 824 (6th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 801 (1987);  Ferndale Laboratories, Inc. v.
Cavendish, 79 F.3d 488 (6th Cir. 1996); Mon-Shor Management, Inc. v. Family Media, Inc., 584
F. Supp. 186, 189-92 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).
