    Section 6.  
Section

415

    
     78A-6-312.  Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.
            
416

    
    (1)  The court may:
            
417

    
    (a)  make any of the dispositions described in Section 

78A-6-117

;
            
418

    
    (b)  place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any:
            
419

    
    (i)  individual; or
            
420

    
    (ii)  public or private entity or agency; or
            
421

    
    (c)  order:
            
422

    
    (i)  protective supervision;
            
423

    
    (ii)  family preservation;

425

    
    (iv)  other services.
            
426

    
    (2) (a) (i)  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing,
            
427

    
and that the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:
            
428

    
    (A)  establish a primary permanency goal for the minor; and
            
429

    
    (B)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency goal, reunification services
            
430

    
are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsection (3).

            
431


    
    (ii)  Subject to Subsection (2)(b), if the court determines that reunification services are
            
432

    
appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for reasonable
            
433

    
parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed, unless
            
434

    
parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.
            
435

    
    (iii) (A)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment,
            
436

    
severe abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to
            
437

    
make "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or
            
438

    
to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.
            
439

    
    (B)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount
            
440

    
concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.
            
441

    
    (b) (i)  For purposes of Subsection (2)(a)(ii), parent-time is in the best interests of a
            
442

    
minor unless the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:
            
443

    
    (A)  protect the physical safety of the minor;
            
444

    
    (B)  protect the life of the minor; or
            
445

    
    (C)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the
            
446

    
minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.
            
447

    
    (ii)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(a)(ii), a court may not deny parent-time based
            
448

    
solely on a parent's failure to:
            
449

    
    (A)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or
            
450

    
    (B)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.
            
451

    
    (c) (i)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a concurrent
            
452

    
permanency goal that shall include:
            
453

    
    (A)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal
            
454

    
will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal; and
            
455

    
    (B)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency
            
456

    
goal.
            
457

    
    (ii)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection
            
458

    

78A-6-314

(1)(b) within 30 days if something other than reunification is initially established as
            
459

    
a minor's primary permanency goal.
            
460

    
    (iii) (A)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency goal before the
            
461

    
establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 

78A-6-314

.

            
462


    
    (B)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event
            
463

    
that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.
            
464

    
    (C)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor's
            
465

    
primary permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with
            
466

    
Section 

78A-6-314

 on or before the earlier of: 
            
467

    
    (I)  30 days from the day on which the court makes the determination described in this
            
468

    
Subsection (2)(c)(iii)(C); or
            
469

    
    (II)  12 months from the day on which the minor was first removed from the minor's
            
470

    
home.
            
471

    
    (d) (i) (A)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall
            
472

    
order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor's
            
473

    
parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.
            
474

    
    (B)  In providing the services described in Subsection (2)(d)(i)(A), the minor's health,
            
475

    
safety, and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.
            
476

    
    (ii)  The court shall:
            
477

    
    (A)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child
            
478

    
and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;
            
479

    
    (B)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family
            
480

    
plan in accordance with Subsection 

62A-4a-205

(6)(e); and
            
481

    
    (C)  identify on the record the responsibilities described in Subsection (2)(d)(ii)(B), for
            
482

    
the purpose of assisting in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable
            
483

    
efforts, in accordance with state and federal law.
            
484

    
    (iii) (A)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the
            
485

    
date that the minor was initially removed from the minor's home.
            
486

    
    (B)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12
            
487

    
months of reunification services.
            
488

    
    (iv)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at any
            
489

    
time.
            
490

    
    (v)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined
            
491

    
to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section
            
492

    

78A-6-314

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:

            
493


    
    (A)  place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan; and
            
494

    
    (B)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the
            
495

    
minor.
            
496

    
    (e)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
497

    
described in Subsection (2)(d) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
498

    
    (f) (i)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted by
            
499

    
the court in accordance with Section 

78A-6-314

 at the expiration of the time period for
            
500

    
reunification services.
            
501

    
    (ii)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original
            
502

    
removal of the minor.
            
503

    
    (iii)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
504

    
within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78A-6-314

.
            
505

    
    (g)  With regard to a minor who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the minor is
            
506

    
initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
507

    
    (i)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
508

    
pursuant to Section 

78A-6-314

; and
            
509

    
    (ii)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
510

    
removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts
            
511

    
to comply with the child and family plan.
            
512

    
    (h)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are
            
513

    
ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six
            
514

    
months from the date that reunification services were ordered:
            
515

    
    (i)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and
            
516

    
    (ii)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.
            
517

    
    (i)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section 

78A-6-314

,
            
518

    
the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the sibling group
            
519

    
together is:
            
520

    
    (i)  practicable; and
            
521

    
    (ii)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.
            
522

    
    (3) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
523

    
permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a

            
524


    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.
            
525

    
    (b)  The court may determine that:
            
526

    
    (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,
            
527

    
based on the individual circumstances; and
            
528

    
    (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.
            
529

    
    (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in
            
530

    
making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount
            
531

    
concern.
            
532

    
    (d) (i)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
533

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
534

    
circumstances exist:
            
535

    
    (A)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
536

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
537

    
    (B)  subject to Subsection (3)(d)(ii), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such
            
538

    
magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;
            
539

    
    (C)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,
            
540

    
sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:
            
541

    
    (I)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;
            
542

    
    (II)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and
            
543

    
    (III)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual
            
544

    
exploitation;
            
545

    
    (D)  the parent:
            
546

    
    (I)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect; or
            
547

    
    (II)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:
            
548

    
    (Aa)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or
            
549

    
    (Bb)  child abuse homicide;
            
550

    
    (E)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
551

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
552

    
minor;
            
553

    
    (F)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,
            
554

    
and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the

            
555


    
offending parent;
            
556

    
    (G)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;
            
557

    
    (H)  the minor is removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions
            
558

    
and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;
            
559

    
    (I)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;
            
560

    
    (J)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a
            
561

    
location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation
            
562

    
was located; or
            
563

    
    (K)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
564

    
efforts or services.
            
565

    
    (ii)  The finding under Subsection (3)(d)(i)(B) shall be based on competent evidence
            
566

    
from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing
            
567

    
that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately
            
568

    
caring for the minor within 12 months from the day on which the court finding is made.
            
569

    
    (4)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take
            
570

    
into consideration:
            
571

    
    (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child
            
572

    
and family plan;
            
573

    
    (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of
            
574

    
drugs or alcohol;
            
575

    
    (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family
            
576

    
member;
            
577

    
    (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;
            
578

    
    (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;
            
579

    
    (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
580

    
successful; and
            
581

    
    (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.
            
582

    
    (5) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), and the
            
583

    
whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the
            
584

    
minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.
            
585

    
    (b)  The time limits described in Subsection (2) are not tolled by the parent's absence.

            
586


    
    (6) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
587

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor. 
            
588

    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (6)(a), the court shall
            
589

    
consider:
            
590

    
    (i)  the age of the minor;
            
591

    
    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;
            
592

    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence;
            
593

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment;
            
594

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;
            
595

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;
            
596

    
    (vii)  for a minor ten years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the
            
597

    
implementation of family reunification services; and
            
598

    
    (viii)  any other appropriate factors.
            
599

    (1) (a)  When reunification services have been ordered in accordance with Section

78A-6-312

, with regard to a minor who is in the custody of the Division of Child and Family

Services, a permanency hearing shall be held by the court no later than 12 months after the
            
613

    
original removal of the minor.
            
614

    
    (b)  If reunification services were not ordered at the dispositional hearing, a permanency

618

    
(3), whether the minor may safely be returned to the custody of the minor's parent.
            
619

    
    (b)  If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that return of the minor
            
620

    
would create a substantial risk of detriment to the minor's physical or emotional well-being, the
            
621

    
minor may not be returned to the custody of the minor's parent.
            
622

    
    (c)  Prima facie evidence that return of the minor to a parent or guardian would create a
            
623

    
substantial risk of detriment to the minor is established if the parent or guardian fails to:
            
624

    
    (i)  participate in a court approved child and family plan;

    (iii)  meet the goals of a court approved child and family plan.
            
627

    
    (3)  In making a determination under Subsection (2)(a), the court shall review and
            
628

    
consider:
            
629

    
    (a)  the report prepared by the Division of Child and Family Services;

635

    
provided.
            
636

    
    (4) (a)  With regard to a case where reunification services were ordered by the court, if
            
637

    
a minor is not returned to the minor's parent or guardian at the permanency hearing, the court
            
638

    
shall:
            
639

    
    (i)  order termination of reunification services to the parent;
            
640

    
    (ii)  make a final determination regarding whether termination of parental rights,
            
641

    
adoption, or permanent custody and guardianship is the most appropriate final plan for the
            
642

    
minor, taking into account the minor's primary permanency goal established by the court
            
643

    
pursuant to Section 

78A-6-312

; and
            
644

    
    (iii)  establish a concurrent plan that identifies the second most appropriate final plan
            
645

    
for the minor.
            
646

    
    (b)  If the Division of Child and Family Services documents to the court that there is a
            
647

    
compelling reason that adoption, reunification, guardianship, and a placement described in

            
648


    
Subsection 

78A-6-306

(6)(e) are not in the minor's best interest, the court may order another
            
649

    
planned permanent living arrangement, in accordance with federal law.
            
650

    
    (c)  If the minor clearly desires contact with the parent, the court shall take the minor's
            
651

    
desire into consideration in determining the final plan.
            
652

    
    (d)  Consistent with Subsection (4)(e), the court may not extend reunification services
            
653

    
beyond 12 months from the date the minor was initially removed from the minor's home, in
            
654

    
accordance with the provisions of Section 

78A-6-312

, except that the court may extend
            
655

    
reunification services for no more than 90 days if the court finds that:
            
656

    
    (i)  there has been substantial compliance with the child and family plan;
            
657

    
    (ii)  reunification is probable within that 90-day period; and
            
658

    
    (iii)  the extension is in the best interest of the minor.
            
659

    
    (e) (i)  In no event may any reunification services extend beyond 15 months from the
            
660

    
date the minor was initially removed from the minor's home.
            
661

    
    (ii)  Delay or failure of a parent to establish paternity or seek custody does not provide a
            
662

    
basis for the court to extend services for that parent beyond that 12-month period.
            
663

    
    (f)  The court may, in its discretion:
            
664

    
    (i)  enter any additional order that it determines to be in the best interest of the minor,
            
665

    
so long as that order does not conflict with the requirements and provisions of Subsections
            
666

    
(4)(a) through (e); or
            
667

    
    (ii)  order the division to provide protective supervision or other services to a minor and
            
668

    
the minor's family after the division's custody of a minor has been terminated.
            
669

    
    (5)  If the final plan for the minor is to proceed toward termination of parental rights,
            
670

    
the petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed, and a pretrial held, within 45
            
671

    
calendar days after the permanency hearing.
            
672

    
    (6) (a)  Any party to an action may, at any time, petition the court for an expedited
            
673

    
permanency hearing on the basis that continuation of reunification efforts are inconsistent with
            
674

    
the permanency needs of the minor.
            
675

    
    (b)  If the court so determines, it shall order, in accordance with federal law, that:
            
676

    
    (i)  the minor be placed in accordance with the permanency plan; and
            
677

    
    (ii)  whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the minor be
            
678

    
completed as quickly as possible.

            
679


    
    (7)  Nothing in this section may be construed to:

    (a)  entitle any parent to reunification services for any specified period of time;
            
681

    
    (b)  limit a court's ability to terminate reunification services at any time prior to a
            
682

    (c)  limit or prohibit the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights by any
            
684

    
party, or a hearing on termination of parental rights, at any time prior to a permanency hearing.
            
685

    
    (8) (a)  Subject to Subsection (8)(b), if a petition for termination of parental rights is
            
686

    
filed prior to the date scheduled for a permanency hearing, the court may consolidate the
            
687

    
hearing on termination of parental rights with the permanency hearing.
            
688

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (8)(a), if the court consolidates the hearing on
            
689

    
termination of parental rights with the permanency hearing:
            
690

    
    (i)  the court shall first make a finding regarding whether reasonable efforts have been
            
691

    
made by the Division of Child and Family Services to finalize the permanency goal for the
            
692

    
minor; and
            
693

    
    (ii)  any reunification services shall be terminated in accordance with the time lines

described in Section

696

    
months from the day on which the minor is removed from the minor's home.
            
697

    
    (9)  If a court determines that a child will not be returned to a parent of the child, the
            
698

    
court shall consider appropriate placement options inside and outside of the state.
