Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
29

    
    WHEREAS, by 2040, the population of the state that is 85 years of age or older and
            
30

    
most likely to need caregiving assistance is projected to reach 128,771;
            
31

    
    WHEREAS, almost all older adults who need assistance with activities of daily living
            
32

    
want to remain in their homes and communities;
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, providing services and support to older adults in their homes and
            
34

    
communities is generally much less expensive than nursing home care;
            
35

    
    WHEREAS, older adults who receive services from caregivers in their homes are much
            
36

    
less likely to need public assistance;
            
37

    
    WHEREAS, almost three-fourths of older people living in the community who receive
            
38

    
personal assistance rely exclusively on unpaid caregivers for help;
            
39

    
    WHEREAS, an estimated 382,000 adults in the state provide care to adult relatives or
            
40

    
friends, which equates to an estimated 365 million hours a year and an estimated value of $4.2
            
41

    
billion each year;
            
42

    
    WHEREAS, nationally, 70% of people with Alzheimer's Disease or a related disorder
            
43

    
live at home and need assistance with activities of daily living; and
            
44

    
    WHEREAS, to successfully address the surging population of older adults who have
            
45

    
significant needs for long-term services and support, the state should develop methods to both
            
46

    
encourage and support families to assist their aging relatives and develop ways to recruit and
            
47

    
retain a qualified, responsive in-home care workforce:
            
48

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
49

    
expresses support for the dedicated work of family caregivers statewide and recognizes
            
50

    
caregiving for older, vulnerable adults as a vital and needed profession today and in the future.
            
51

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature expresses support for innovative
            
52

    
and creative means to support family caregivers to continue providing needed in-home support
            
53

    
for older, vulnerable, or adults with a disability.
            
54

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature expresses support for state policies
            
55

    
and programs that address the needs of older, vulnerable, or adults with a disability and their
            
56

    
caregivers, as well as agencies that provide additional information and education on supporting
            
57

    
older, vulnerable adults, or adults with a disability, in their homes through both family
            
58

    
caregivers and paid professional caregivers.

            
59


    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature encourages the review of state
            
60

    
policies and supports current state programs that address the needs of older adults and their

caregivers.
