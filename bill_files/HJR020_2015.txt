In its discretion and on such32     conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the court may stay the execution33     of, or any proceedings to enforce, a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new34     trial or to alter or amend a judgment made pursuant to Rule 59, or of a motion for relief from a35     judgment or order made pursuant to Rule 60, or of a motion for judgment in accordance with a36     motion for a directed verdict made pursuant to Rule 50, or of a motion for amendment to the37     findings or for additional findings made pursuant to Rule 52(b).38          (c)  Injunction pending appeal.  When an appeal is taken from an interlocutory order or39     final judgment granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its discretion may40     suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such41     conditions as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party.42          (d)  Stay upon appeal.  When an appeal is taken, the appellant by giving a supersedeas43     bond may obtain a stay, unless such a stay is otherwise prohibited by law or these rules.  The44     bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal.  The stay is effective when45     the supersedeas bond is approved by the court.46          (e) [(1)]  Stay in favor of the state, or agency thereof.  When an appeal is taken by the47     United States, the state of Utah, or an officer or agency of either, or by direction of any48     department of either, and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond,49     obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant.50          [(e) (2) For purposes of this rule, a municipality shall not be considered a state agency51     exempt from the requirement of posting a bond, obligation, or other security when appealing a52     judgment for any amounts in excess of $5,000,000.  To stay the enforcement of any judgment53     over $5,000,000, the municipality shall be required to post security with the appellate court in54     the amount by which the judgment exceeds the sum of $5,000,000 and for any interest that may55     accrue during the appeal.]56          (f)  Stay in quo warranto proceedings.  Where the defendant is adjudged guilty of57     usurping, intruding into or unlawfully holding public office, civil or military, within this state,58     the execution of the judgment shall not be stayed on an appeal.59          (g)  Power of appellate court not limited.  The provisions in this rule do not limit any60     power of an appellate court or of a judge or justice thereof to stay proceedings or to suspend,61     modify, restore, or grant an injunction, or extraordinary relief or to make any order appropriate62     to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered.63          (h)  Stay of judgment upon multiple claims.  When a court has ordered a final judgment64     on some but not all of the claims presented in the action under the conditions stated in Rule65     54(b), the court may stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent66     judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the67     benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.68          (i)  Form of supersedeas bond; deposit in lieu of bond; waiver of bond; jurisdiction over69     sureties to be set forth in undertaking.70          (i) (1)  A supersedeas bond given under Subdivision (d) may be either a commercial71     bond having a surety authorized to transact insurance business under Title 31A, or a personal72     bond having one or more sureties who are residents of Utah having a collective net worth of at73     least twice the amount of the bond, exclusive of property exempt from execution.  Sureties on74     personal bonds shall make and file an affidavit setting forth in reasonable detail the assets and75     liabilities of the surety.76          (i) (2)  Upon motion and good cause shown, the court may permit a deposit of money in77     court or other security to be given in lieu of giving a supersedeas bond under Subdivision (d).78          (i) (3)  The parties may by written stipulation waive the requirement of giving a79     supersedeas bond under Subdivision (d) or agree to an alternate form of security.80          (i) (4)  A supersedeas bond given pursuant to Subdivision (d) shall provide that each81     surety submits to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as82     the surety's agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety's liability on the bond may be83     served, and that the surety's liability may be enforced on motion and upon such notice as the84     court may require without the necessity of an independent action.85          (j)  Amount of supersedeas bond.86          (j) (1)  Except as provided in subsection (j)(2), a court shall set the supersedeas bond in87     an amount that adequately protects the judgment creditor against loss or damage occasioned by88     the appeal and assures payment in the event the judgment is affirmed.  In setting the amount,89     the court may consider any relevant factor, including:90          (j) (1) (A)  the judgment debtor's ability to pay the judgment;91          (j) (1) (B)  the existence and value of security;92          (j) (1) (C)  the judgment debtor's opportunity to dissipate assets;93          (j) (1) (D)  the judgment debtor's likelihood of success on appeal; and94          (j) (1) (E)  the respective harm to the parties from setting a higher or lower amount.95          (j) (2)  Notwithstanding subsection (j)(1):96          (j) (2) (A)  the presumptive amount of a bond for compensatory damages is the amount97     of the compensatory damages plus costs and attorney fees, as applicable, plus 3 years of98     interest at the applicable interest rate;99          (j) (2) (B)  the bond for compensatory damages shall not exceed $25 million in an100     action by plaintiffs certified as a class under Rule 23 or in an action by multiple plaintiffs in101     which compensatory damages are not proved for each plaintiff individually; and102          (j) (2) (C)  no bond shall be required for punitive damages.103          (j) (3)  If the court permits a bond that is less than the presumptive amount of104     compensatory damages, the court may also enter such orders as are necessary to protect the105     judgment creditor during the appeal.106          (j) (4)  If the court finds that the judgment debtor has violated an order or has otherwise107     dissipated assets, the court may set the bond under subsection (j)(1) without regard to the limits108     in subsection (j)(2).109          (k)  Objecting to sufficiency or amount of security.  Any party whose judgment is110     stayed or sought to be stayed pursuant to Subdivision (d) may object to the sufficiency of the111     sureties on the supersedeas bond or the amount thereof, or to the sufficiency or amount of other112     security given to stay the judgment by filing and giving notice of such objection.  The party so113     objecting shall be entitled to a hearing thereon upon five days notice or such shorter time as the114     court may order.  The burden of justifying the sufficiency of the sureties or other security and115     the amount of the bond or other security, shall be borne by the party seeking the stay, unless the116     objecting party seeks a bond greater than the presumed limits of this rule.  The fact that a117     supersedeas bond, its surety or other security is generally permitted under this rule shall not be118     conclusive as to its sufficiency or amount.119          Section 2.  Effective date.120          This resolution takes effect upon approval by a constitutional majority vote of all121     members of the Senate and House of Representatives.Legislative Review Note     as of   2-4-15  10:07 AMOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
