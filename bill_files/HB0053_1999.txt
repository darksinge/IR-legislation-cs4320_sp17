Counsel may advise the person, in                           confidence, either upon the request of the person or upon counsel s own initiative, with respect to                           any question asked of the person.   The person or counsel may object on the record to any question,                           in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for the objection.  An objection                            may properly be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that the person                            is entitled to refuse to answer the question on grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or                            privilege, including the privilege against self incrimination.  If the person refuses to answer any                            question, the attorney general may petition the district court for an order compelling  such  the                            person to answer the question.                                 g   If any person compelled to appear under a demand for oral testimony or other                            information pursuant to this section refuses to answer any questions or produce information on                            grounds of the privilege against self incrimination, the testimony of  such  that person may be                            compelled as in criminal cases.                                 h   Any person appearing for oral examination pursuant to a demand served under this                            section is entitled to the same fees and mileage which are paid to witnesses in the district courts                            of the state of Utah.  Witness fees and expenses shall be tendered and paid as in any civil action.                                     The providing of any testimony, documents, or objects in response to a civil                            investigative demand issued pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be considered part of an                            official proceeding as defined in Section                 .                                     a   If a person  fails to comply with the demand served upon him under this section,                            the attorney general may file in the district court of the county in which the person resides, is                            found, or does business, a petition for an order compelling compliance with the demand.  Notice                            of hearing of the petition and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the person, who may                            appear in opposition to the petition.  If the court finds that the demand is proper, that there is                            reasonable cause to believe there has been a violation of this act, and that the information sought                               or document or object demanded is relevant to the violation, it shall order the person to comply                            with the demand, subject to  such  modifications  as  the court may prescribe.                                 b   i   At any time before the return date specified in a demand or within    days after the                            demand has been served, whichever period is shorter, the person who has been served may file a                            petition for an order modifying or setting aside the demand.  This petition shall be filed in the                            district court in the county of the person s residence, principal office, or place of business, or in the                            district court in Salt Lake County.  The petition shall specify each ground upon which the                            petitioner relies in seeking the relief sought.  The petition may be based upon any failure of the                            demand to comply with the provisions of this section or upon any constitutional or other legal right                            or privilege of the petitioner.  The petitioner shall serve notice of hearing of the petition and a copy                            of the petition upon the attorney general.  The attorney general may submit an answer to the                            petition within    days after receipt of the petition.                                 ii   After hearing on the petition described in Subsection     b  i , and for good cause                            shown, the court may make any further order in the proceedings that justice requires to protect the                            person from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden, or expense.  At any                            hearing pursuant to this section it is the attorney general s burden to establish that the demand is                            proper, that there is reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of this act, and that                            the information sought or document or object demanded is relevant to the violation.                                     a   Any procedure, testimony taken, or material produced under this section shall be                            kept confidential by the attorney general unless confidentiality is waived in writing by the person                            who has testified, or produced documents or objects.                                 b   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the attorney general may disclose                            testimony or documents obtained under this section, without either the consent of the person from                            whom it was received or the person being investigated, to                                  i   any grand jury  and                                 ii   officers and employees of federal or state law enforcement agencies, provided the                            person from whom the information, documents, or objects were obtained is notified    days prior                            to disclosure, and the federal or state law enforcement agency certifies that the information will                            be                                  A   maintained in confidence, as required by Subsection     a   and                                 B   used only for official law enforcement purposes.                                        Use of a civil investigative demand under this action precludes the invocation by the                            attorney general of Section                .
