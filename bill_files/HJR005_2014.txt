25

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
26

    
    WHEREAS, the 11-member Uniform Building Code Commission (UBCC) is
            
27

    
appointed by the governor and comprised of architects, engineers, contractors, building and fire

            
28


    
officials, and members of the public who are considered experts in their fields;
            
29

    
    WHEREAS, in addition to the UBCC there are also seven advisory committees,
            
30

    
comprised of 32 members, who report to the UBCC;
            
31

    
    WHEREAS, these advisory committees are also comprised of architects, engineers,
            
32

    
contractors, building and fire officials, and members of the public;
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, in 2012, the UBCC and its seven advisory committees held 63 meetings to
            
34

    
review the 2012 codes and amendments;
            
35

    
    WHEREAS, the aggressive meeting schedule required dedication and commitment
            
36

    
from all parties involved;
            
37

    
    WHEREAS, other than UBCC members, who receive a modest stipend, the time spent
            
38

    
is completed at committee members' own expense or the expense of the business or jurisdiction
            
39

    
for which each member works;
            
40

    
    WHEREAS, this dedication demonstrates the commitment of all parties involved to
            
41

    
providing the state of Utah with the most up-to-date codes, which have been thoroughly
            
42

    
reviewed and vetted;
            
43

    
    WHEREAS, it would benefit all parties involved to take advantage of the knowledge
            
44

    
and expertise these committee members have to offer;
            
45

    
    WHEREAS, the UBCC is recognized in Utah Code Section 

15-A-1-203


 as the only
            
46

    
entity to advise the Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL) with respect
            
47

    
to DOPL's responsibilities in administering the construction codes for the state of Utah;
            
48

    
    WHEREAS, the state statute delegates construction code interpretation and opinions to
            
49

    
the UBCC;
            
50

    
    WHEREAS, it would seem appropriate that, if not required by law, any action to
            
51

    
change the construction code should be submitted to the commission for its opinion;
            
52

    
    WHEREAS, once vetted, the commission's opinion is then submitted to the Business
            
53

    
and Labor Interim Committee for a ruling as to whether the proposed code change should be
            
54

    
prepared for potential legislative action; and
            
55

    
    WHEREAS, following this process will establish and ensure that life, safety, good
            
56

    
construction practice, public welfare, and a common sense of order is followed when
            
57

    
construction code changes are proposed through legislation:
            
58

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah

            
59


    
recognizes the Uniform Building Code Commission as the only entity to advise the Division of

61

    
administering the construction codes for the state of Utah.
            
62

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah recognizes that
            
63

    
any action to change the state construction code should be submitted to the Uniform Building
            
64

    
Code Commission for its opinion.
            
65

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Uniform
            
66

    
Building Code Commission and the Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing.
