 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-17-12  5:34 PM

As required by legislative rules and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General
Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its
own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill.  The note is based on an analysis of
relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill.  The note is not written for
the purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide
information relevant to legislators' consideration of this bill.  The note is not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a law in the
context of a specific case.


This bill expands sales and use tax payment, collection, and remittance obligations to include 

out of state sellers who have a certain ownership or other relationship with an in state seller. 
These relationships include an out of state seller who has a substantial ownership interest in an
in state business, or a seller who makes sales to in state purchasers by mail, telephone, the
Internet, or other media, and has a contractual relationship with an in state seller to perform
installation, maintenance, or repair services for those in state purchasers. 

Because this bill imposes obligations on out of state sellers, the bill raises issues under the
Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Constitution of the Unites States
grants Congress the authority to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the
several States."  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8.  Case law has interpreted the Commerce Clause as
having a dormant aspect, which "prohibits certain state actions that interfere with interstate
commerce."  Quill Corp. v. North Dakota By and Through Heitkamp, 504 U.S. 298, 309 (1992)
(quoting South Caroling State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303 U.S. 177, 185
(1938)). 

In evaluating a state statute under a dormant Commerce Clause challenge, the Supreme Court
of the United States has held that a state may not require an out-of state seller to collect and
remit a use tax unless the seller has "substantial nexus" with the taxing state.  Quill, 504 U.S. at
311.  The Court has found that "a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail
or common carrier lacks the 'substantial nexus' required by the Commerce Clause."  The Quill
case thus established a bright-line rule that some physical presence is required in a state before
the state may impose sales and use tax collection obligations on a seller.  Quill, 504 U.S. at 315
("[w]hether or not a State may compel a vendor to collect a sales or use tax may turn on the
presence in the taxing State of a small sales force, plant, or office.")  In Scripto v. Carson, the
Supreme Court of the United States found that independent contractors soliciting business
within a state was sufficient presence for the state to impose use tax collection duties.  Scripto
v. Carson, 362 U.S. 207, 211 (1960).     

This bill raises the issue of the application of the Quill case and its "substantial nexus" standard
to an area of rapidly changing, evolving technology.  Cases are currently moving through the
courts that provide the courts with an opportunity to more clearly define and articulate the legal
contours of what constitutes "substantial nexus" with a taxing state.  It is impossible to predict
the outcome of these cases and what changes, if any, they might have on the standards set forth
in Quill.  In addition, the Court in Quill noted that this issue is "one that Congress may be
better qualified to resolve" and also "has the ultimate power to resolve."  Quill, 504 U.S. at
318. Thus, it is also possible that Congress may act on this interstate commerce issue.       

However, because current dormant Commerce Clause case law under Quill requires physical
presence to satisfy "substantial nexus," there is a high probability that if challenged, a court
would hold that this bill, which establishes nexus on the basis of an ownership or other
relationship between an out of state seller and an in state seller, violates the dormant
Commerce Clause.
