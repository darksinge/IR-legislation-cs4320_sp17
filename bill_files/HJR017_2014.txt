    4.  no facility debt in Iron County
            
50

    
    5. $18 million for 37 years in Kane County

64-13e-103


(6); and
            
57

    
    WHEREAS, contracting with the Utah Department of Corrections for additional prison
            
58

59


    
and Iron County's efforts to have sufficient capacity to house its prison populations:
            
60

61
