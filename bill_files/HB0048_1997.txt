This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                        , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section           is amended to read                        .  Capital felony    Sentencing proceeding.                   When a defendant has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a capital felony, there shall          be further proceedings before the court or jury on the issue of sentence.  In the case of a plea of          guilty to a capital felony, the sentencing proceedings shall be conducted by the court which          accepted the plea or by a jury upon request of the defendant. When a defendant has been found          guilty of a capital felony, the proceedings shall be conducted before the court or jury which found          the defendant guilty, provided the defendant may waive hearing before the jury, in which event          the hearing shall be before the court.  If, however, circumstances make it impossible or impractical          to reconvene the same jury for the sentencing proceedings, the court may dismiss that jury and          convene a new jury for such proceedings.  If a retrial of the sentencing proceedings is necessary          as a consequence of a remand from an appellate court, the sentencing authority shall be determined          as provided in Subsection    .                    a   In capital sentencing proceedings, evidence may be presented on               i   the nature and circumstances of the crime               ii   the defendant s character, background, history, mental and physical condition               iii   the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim s family and community without         comparison to other persons or victims  and              iv   any other facts in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty that the court considers         relevant to the sentence.              b   Any evidence the court considers to have probative force may be received regardless         of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.  The state s attorney and the defendant          shall be permitted to present argument for or against the sentence of death.                   Aggravating circumstances shall include those outlined in Section         .           Mitigating circumstances shall include                a   the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity                b   the homicide was committed while the defendant was under the influence of  extreme           mental or emotional disturbance                c   the defendant acted under  extreme  duress or under the  substantial  domination of          another person                d   at the time of the homicide, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the          wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of law was           substantially  impaired as a result of mental disease, intoxication, or influence of drugs                e   the youth of the defendant at the time of the crime                f   the defendant was an accomplice in the homicide committed by another person and           his  the defendant s participation was relatively minor  and               g   any other fact in mitigation of the penalty.                   The court or jury, as the case may be, shall retire to consider the penalty.   In  Except          as provided in Subsection         .    , in all proceedings before a jury, under this section, it          shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon a unanimous verdict for death and that          the penalty of either life in prison or  with regard to sentences to be imposed on or after April   ,              ,  life in prison without parole, shall be imposed if a unanimous verdict for death is not found.            The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the aggravating and          mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that total aggravation                 outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the         imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.  If the jury reports         unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall discharge the jury and shall         impose the sentence of death.  If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict imposing the         sentence of death,  with regard to sentences to be imposed on or after April   ,     , the court         shall instruct  except as provided in Subsection         .    , the jury  to  shall then determine          by a unanimous vote  whether the penalty of life in prison without parole shall be imposed.  The         penalty of life in prison without parole shall only be imposed if the jury is clearly convinced that         the sentence of life in prison without parole is appropriate.  If the jury reports agreement by ten          jurors or more to impose the sentence of life in prison without parole, the court shall discharge the          jury and shall impose the sentence of life in prison without parole.  If  the jury is unable to reach          a verdict  ten jurors or more do not agree upon a sentence of life in prison without parole, the court          shall discharge the jury and impose the sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of          parole.  If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, the court shall determine          the appropriate penalty according to the standards of this subsection.                   Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate court,          if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence of death          and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent necessary to          correct the error or errors.  No error in the sentencing proceedings shall result in the reversal of the          conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing proceedings, all exhibits and          a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial and sentencing          proceedings shall be admissible in the new sentencing proceedings, and if the sentencing          proceeding was before a                a   jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding                b   judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding  or               c   judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new sentencing          proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing proceeding.                   In the event the death penalty is held to be unconstitutional by the Utah Supreme Court          or the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously          sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause  such  the person to be brought before the court,          and the court shall sentence the person to life in prison, if the death penalty is held unconstitutional                 prior to April   ,     , or life in prison without parole if the death penalty is held unconstitutional         on or after April   ,     , and any person who is thereafter convicted of a capital felony shall be         sentenced to life  in prison or life in prison without parole.
