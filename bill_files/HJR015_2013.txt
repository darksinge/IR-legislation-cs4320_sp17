 LONG TITLE
            
9

    
 General Description:
            
10

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature declares and asserts the jurisdictional right of the
            
11

    
state of Utah and its political subdivisions to respond to and take action when
            
12

    
conditions on federally managed land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely
            
13

    
affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people.
            
14

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
15

    
    This resolution:
            
16

    
    .    declares and asserts the jurisdictional right of the state of Utah and its political
            
17

    
subdivisions to respond to and take action when conditions on federally managed
            
18

    
land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely affect, the health, safety, or
            
19

    
welfare of the people without the intrusion and interference of the federal
            
20

    
government on its efforts to respond to the needs of its citizens; and
            
21

    
    .    urges other states to declare and assert their rights, and the rights of their political
            
22

    
subdivisions, to respond to and take action when conditions on federally managed
            
23

    
land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely affect, the health, safety, or
            
24

    
welfare of the people without the intrusion and interference of the federal
            
25

    
government on the states' efforts to respond to the needs of their citizens.
            
26

    
 Special Clauses:
            
27

    
    None

            
28


    

            
29

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
30

    
    WHEREAS, in its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act decision, released June
            
31

    
2012, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the position of the states as "separate and
            
32

    
independent sovereigns";
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, the court made it clear that the federal government "must show that a
            
34

    
constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions";
            
35

    
    WHEREAS, in contrast, the Supreme Court further explained that "the same does not
            
36

    
apply to the States, because the Constitution is not the source of their power .  .  . The States
            
37

    
thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government .  .  . even though
            
38

    
the Constitution's text does not authorize any government to do so";
            
39

    
    WHEREAS, the Supreme Court added, "Our cases refer to this general power of
            
40

    
governing, possessed by the States but not by the federal government, as the 'police power.'  . . .
            
41

    
Because the police power is controlled by 50 different states instead of one national sovereign,
            
42

    
the facets of governing that touch on citizens' daily lives are normally administered by smaller
            
43

    
governments closer to the governed.  The Framers thus ensured that powers which 'in the
            
44

    
ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people' were held
            
45

    
by governments more local and more accountable than a distant bureaucracy";
            
46

    
    WHEREAS, the Supreme Court also highlighted a vital role of states' authority in
            
47

    
relation to the federal government, stating, "The independent power of the States also serves as
            
48

    
a check on the power of the Federal Government: 'By denying any one government complete
            
49

    
jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual
            
50

    
from arbitrary power . . . In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives
            
51

    
by adopting 'the simple expedient of not yielding' to federal blandishments when they do not
            
52

    
want to embrace the federal policies as their own";
            
53

    
    WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, concluding this line of logic, declared, "The States are
            
54

    
separate and independent sovereigns.  Sometimes they have to act like it";
            
55

    
    WHEREAS, in 1917, the Court, in Utah Power and Light v. United States, held that
            
56

    
"The power of the United States to protect its property by its own legislation from private
            
57

    
trespass and waste does not, and cannot, imply a general police power over the vacant public
            
58

    
lands within a State.  The section in the Constitution relating to the admission of new States,

            
59


    
and the concomitant disposition of the public lands, excludes, by its express terms, any
            
60

    
construction by which the United States may claim any additional governmental or police
            
61

    
powers within the States in which such public land is situated";
            
62

    
    WHEREAS, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17, of the United States Constitution states
            
63

    
that the federal government will "exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over
            
64

    
such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the
            
65

    
Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to
            
66

    
exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State
            
67

    
in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and
            
68

    
other needful Buildings";
            
69

    
    WHEREAS, the domain of exclusive jurisdiction by the federal government is limited
            
70

    
to the District of Columbia and other Places purchased by the Consent of the State Legislatures
            
71

    
for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings
            
72

    
incidental to the powers expressly granted within the Constitution;
            
73

    
    WHEREAS, "other needful Buildings" did not include vast acres of undeveloped land;
            
74

    
    WHEREAS, although Section 3 of the Utah Enabling Act states, in part, "That the
            
75

    
people inhabiting said proposed State do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right
            
76

    
and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof," the state of
            
77

    
Utah did not disclaim its jurisdiction;
            
78

    
    WHEREAS, during the Eisenhower Administration, the United States government
            
79

    
published a report entitled "Report of the Interdepartmental Committee for the Study of
            
80

    
Jurisdiction Over Federal Areas Within the States" in which four basic areas of federal
            
81

    
jurisdiction were identified:
            
82

    
    1.  Exclusive Legislative Jurisdiction: This term is applied when the federal government
            
83

    
possesses, by whichever method acquired, all of the authority of the State, and in which the
            
84

    
State concerned has not reserved to itself the right to exercise any of the authority concurrently
            
85

    
with the United States except to serve civil or criminal process in the area for activities that
            
86

    
occurred outside the area;
            
87

    
    2.  Concurrent Legislative Jurisdiction: This term is applied in those instances wherein
            
88

    
by granting to the United States authority -- which would otherwise amount to exclusive
            
89

    
legislative jurisdiction over an area -- the State concerned has reserved to itself the right to

            
90


    
exercise, concurrently with the United States, all of the same authority;
            
91

    
    3.  Partial Legislative Jurisdiction: This term is applied in those instances wherein a
            
92

    
state has granted authority to the federal government to legislate over an area of the state but 
            
93

    
the state has reserved to itself the right to exercise, by itself or concurrently with the United
            
94

    
States, other authority constituting more than merely the right to serve civil or criminal process
            
95

    
in the area, or the right to tax private property;
            
96

    
    4.  Proprietorial Interest Only: This term is applied to those instances wherein the
            
97

    
federal government has acquired some right or title to an area in a state, but has not obtained
            
98

    
any measure of the State's authority over the area.  In applying this definition, recognition
            
99

    
should be given to the fact that the United States, by virtue of its functions and authority under
            
100

    
various provisions of the Constitution, has many powers and immunities not possessed by
            
101

    
ordinary landholders with respect to areas in which it acquires an interest, and of the further
            
102

    
fact that all its properties and functions are held or performed in a governmental, rather than a
            
103

    
proprietary, capacity;
            
104

    
    WHEREAS, the report also stated, "It scarcely needs to be said that unless there has
            
105

    
been a transfer of jurisdiction pursuant to clause 17 by a Federal acquisition of land with State
            
106

    
consent, or by cession from the State to the Federal Government, or unless the Federal
            
107

    
Government has reserved jurisdiction upon admission of the State, the Federal Government
            
108

    
possesses no legislative jurisdiction over any area within a State, such jurisdiction being for
            
109

    
exercise by the State, subject to non-interference by the State with Federal functions. . .  The
            
110

    
consent requirement of Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, was intended by the framers of the
            
111

    
Constitution to preserve the State's jurisdictional integrity against federal encroachment.  The
            
112

    
Federal Government cannot, by unilateral action on its part, acquire legislative jurisdiction over
            
113

    
any area within the exterior boundaries of a State";
            
114

    
    WHEREAS, an Inventory Report On Jurisdictional Status of Federal Areas Within the
            
115

    
States, compiled by the United States General Services Administration, categorizes all United
            
116

    
States Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land in the state of Utah
            
117

    
as #4, Proprietorial Interest Only;
            
118

    
    WHEREAS, the USFS and the BLM have caused a public nuisance and safety issue for
            
119

    
the people of the state of Utah and Utah's political subdivisions by not removing the condition,
            
120

    
persistently in the National Forest and BLM system lands, of imminent fire and not mitigating

            
121


    
the effects of recent fires;
            
122

    
    WHEREAS, Utah's 2012 Shingle Creek Fire was human caused on USFS land;
            
123

    
    WHEREAS, the fire was one-third contained by the operation of one bulldozer;
            
124

    
    WHEREAS, four bulldozers were ready for use by 6 p.m. on the day of the fire, but
            
125

    
since the fire was on USFS land, only one bulldozer was allowed to operate until 10 p.m. and
            
126

    
was only allowed to operate one blade wide and to dig no deeper than two inches;
            
127

    
    WHEREAS, as a result, the fire burned more than 8,000 acres, damaged and altered the
            
128

    
local watershed, created future risks of debris and mudslides, and will require costly repairs;
            
129

    
    WHEREAS, Utah's 2012 Seeley Fire, which was started by lightning, eventually
            
130

    
destroyed over 48,000 acres, or 76 square miles;
            
131

    
    WHEREAS, debris flow and sediment from the Seeley Fire will be a major issue in the
            
132

    
surrounding watershed for the next two to five years, impacting local municipalities, power
            
133

    
plants, local businesses, homes, roads, bridges, and farms;
            
134

    
    WHEREAS, in one instance, the USFS chose to bulldoze a portion of private land,
            
135

    
claiming it was the best place to fight the wildfire;
            
136

    
    WHEREAS, these are just two examples of conditions at the community level that have
            
137

    
been made worse by the federal government's mismanagement of federal lands;
            
138

    
    WHEREAS, the jurisdictional right of states and their political subdivisions to mitigate
            
139

    
potential risks to the health, safety, or welfare of the state or a political subdivision should not
            
140

    
be fettered by the federal bureaucracy; and
            
141

    
    WHEREAS, states should assert their rights to mitigate potential risks to the health,
            
142

    
safety, or welfare of the state or a political subdivision and not allow their authority to be
            
143

    
eroded by federal government claims of authority:
            
144

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
145

    
declare and assert its jurisdictional right, and the right of its political subdivisions, to respond
            
146

    
to and take action when conditions on federally managed land in the state adversely affect, or
            
147

    
may adversely affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people without the intrusion and
            
148

    
interference of the federal government on its efforts to respond to the needs of their citizens.
            
149

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature urges the states to declare and
            
150

    
assert their jurisdictional rights, and the rights of their political subdivisions, to respond to and
            
151

    
take action when conditions on federally managed land in the states adversely affect, or may

            
152


    
adversely affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people without the intrusion and
            
153

    
interference of the federal government on efforts to respond to the needs of their citizens.
            
154

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the president of
            
155

    
the United States, the majority leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United
            
156

    
States House of Representatives, the United States Forest Service, the commissions of each
            
157

    
county in the state of Utah, the Council of State Governments, the National Conference of State
            
158

    
Legislatures, and the members of Utah's congressional delegation.
