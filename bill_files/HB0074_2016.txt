An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable,280     binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.281          (5)  Incapacity of the principal of a power of attorney that is not durable does not revoke282     or terminate the power of attorney as to an agent or other person that, without actual knowledge283     of the incapacity, acts in good faith under the power of attorney.  An act so performed, unless284     otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in285     interest.286          (6)  The execution of a power of attorney does not revoke a power of attorney287     previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent power of attorney provides that the288     previous power of attorney is revoked or that all other powers of attorney are revoked.289          Section 12.  Section 75-9-111 is enacted to read:290          75-9-111. Coagents and successor agents.291          (1)  A principal may designate two or more persons to act as coagents.  Unless the292     power of attorney otherwise provides, each coagent may exercise its authority independently.293          (2)  A principal may designate one or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns,294     dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve.  A principal may295     grant authority to designate one or more successor agents to an agent or other person296     designated by name, office, or function.  Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, a297     successor agent:298          (a)  has the same authority as that granted to the original agent; and299          (b)  may not act until all predecessor agents have resigned, died, become incapacitated,300     are no longer qualified to serve, or have declined to serve.301          (3)  Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney and Subsection (4), an agent302     that does not participate in or conceal a breach of fiduciary duty committed by another agent,303     including a predecessor agent, is not liable for the actions of the other agent.304          (4)  An agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary305     duty by another agent shall notify the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated, take any306     action reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to safeguard the principal's best interest.  An307     agent that fails to notify the principal or take action as required by this subsection is liable for308     the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided if the agent had notified the309     principal or taken action.310          Section 13.  Section 75-9-112 is enacted to read:311          75-9-112. Reimbursement and compensation of agent.312          Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, an agent is entitled to reimbursement313     of expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of the principal and to compensation that is314     reasonable under the circumstances.315          Section 14.
