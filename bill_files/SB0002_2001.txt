 This act authorizes issuance of state of Utah general obligation bonds and bond anticipation
            

    
 notes by the State Bonding Commission for highways.  This act defines the process and
            

    
 requirements for issuing the bonds and notes and specifies the use of the proceeds.  This act
            

    
 imposes a statewide property tax and abates it.  This act creates a sinking fund to pay debt
            

    
 service on the bonds.  This act authorizes the issuance of other debt obligations by the State
            

    
 Building Ownership Authority.  This act authorizes other capital facility expenditures.  This
            

    
 act modifies previously adopted intent language.  This act exempts the bonds and notes
            

    
 authorized by this section from the statutory debt limit.  This act provides for related
            

    
 matters and makes technical corrections.
