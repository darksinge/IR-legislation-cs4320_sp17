    (13)  If the records committee fails to issue a decision within [35] 57 calendar days of
            
129

    
the filing of the notice of appeal, that failure shall be considered the equivalent of an order

131

    
petitioner considers the appeal denied.
            
132

    
    (14) (a) Unless a notice of intent to appeal is filed under Subsection (14)(b), each party

135

    
notice of intent to appeal the order of the records committee.
            
136

    
    (c)  If the records committee orders the governmental entity to produce a record and no
            
137

    
appeal is filed, or if, as a result of the appeal, the governmental entity is required to produce a
            
138

    
record, the governmental entity shall:
            
139

    
    (i)  produce the record; and
            
140

    
    (ii)  file a notice of compliance with the records committee. 
            
141

    
    (d) (i)  If the governmental entity that is ordered to produce a record fails to file a notice
            
142

    
of compliance or a notice of intent to appeal, the records committee may do either or both of
            
143

    
the following:
            
144

    
    (A)  impose a civil penalty of up to $500 for each day of continuing noncompliance; or

150

    
circumstances of the violation, including whether the failure to comply was due to neglect or
            
151

    
was willful or intentional.
