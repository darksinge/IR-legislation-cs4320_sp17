The existence and scope of such a usage must beproved as facts.

Ausage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement isto occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.(5)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (6), the express terms of an agreementand any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must beconstrued whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction isunreasonable:(a)  express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage oftrade;(b)  course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and(c)  course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.(6)  Subject to Section

539

    
information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with
            
540

    
the routines.  Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to

communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or
            
542

    
the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be

     70A-1a-302.  Variation by agreement.
            
633

    
    (1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2) or elsewhere in this title, the effect

    (2)  The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care prescribed by this
            
636

    
title may not be disclaimed by agreement.  The parties, by agreement, may determine the
            
637

    
standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards
            
638

    
are not manifestly unreasonable.  Whenever this title requires an action to be taken within a
            
639

    
reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.
            
640

    
    (3)  The presence in certain provisions of this title of the phrase "unless otherwise
            
641

643

    
    Section 24.  
Section  
70A-1a-303

 is enacted to read:
            
644

    
     70A-1a-303.   Course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade.
            
645

    
    (1)  A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a

            
646


    
particular transaction that exists if:
            
647

    
    (a)  the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated
            
648

    
occasions for performance by a party; and
            
649

    
    (b)  the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity
            
650

    
for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.
            
651

    
    (2)  A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions
            
652

    
between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a
            
653

    
common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.
            
654

    
    (3)  A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of
            
655

    
observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed
            
656

    
with respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage must be
            
657

    
proved as facts.  If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar
            
658

    
record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.
            
659

    
    (4)  A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade
            
660

    
in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is
            
661

    
relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to
            
662

    
specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  A
            
663

    
usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is
            
664

    
to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.
            
665

    
    (5)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (6), the express terms of an agreement
            
666

    
and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be
            
667

    
construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction is
            
668

    
unreasonable:
            
669

    
    (a)  express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of
            
670

    
trade;
            
671

    
    (b)  course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and
            
672

    
    (c)  course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.
            
673

    
    (6)  Subject to Section 

70A-2-209

, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver

            
674


    
or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.
            
675

    
    (7)  Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless
            
676

    
that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair
            
677

    
surprise to the other party.

    (1)  The remedies provided by this title must be liberally administered to the end that
            
685

    
the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed
            
686

    
but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as
            
687

    
specifically provided in this title or by other rule of law.
            
688

    
    (2)  Any right or obligation declared by this title is enforceable by action unless the

provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.

without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record.

    A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of
            
697

    
insurance, official weigher's or inspector's certificate, consular invoice, or any other document
            
698

    
authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its
            
699

    
own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.

    Section 29.

    (1)  A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or
            
703

    
assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby
            
704

    
prejudice the rights reserved.  Such words as "without prejudice," "under protest," or the like
            
705

    
are sufficient.
            
706

    
    (2)  Subsection (1) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.
            
707

    
    Section 30.  
Section  
70A-1a-309

710

    
payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when the party
            
711

    
"considers itself insecure," or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so
            
712

    
only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is
            
713

    
impaired.  The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power
            
714

    
has been exercised.

    Section 31.
