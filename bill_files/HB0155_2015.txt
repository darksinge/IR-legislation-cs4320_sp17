No notice is required in connection with accounts or other liabilities of the196     institution that will be paid in full or be fully assumed by another depository institution or trust197     company.  The notice shall specify a filing date for claims against the institution not less than198     60 days after the date of mailing.  Claimants whose claims against the institution have been199     assumed by another depository institution or trust company pursuant to a merger or purchase200     and assumption agreement with the commissioner, or a federal deposit insurance agency201     appointed as receiver or liquidator of the institution, shall be notified of the assumption of their202     claims and the name and address of the assuming party within 60 days after the claim is203     assumed.  Unless a purchase and assumption or merger agreement requires otherwise, the204     assuming party shall give all required notices.  Notice shall be mailed to the address appearing205     in the books and records of the institution.206          (ii)  Inadvertent or unintentional failure to mail a notice to any person entitled to written207     notice under this paragraph does not impose any liability on the commissioner or any receiver208     or liquidator appointed by him beyond the amount the claimant would be entitled to receive if209     the claim had been timely filed and allowed.  The commissioner or any receiver or liquidator210     appointed by him are not liable for failure to mail notice unless the claimant establishes that it211     had no knowledge of the commissioner taking possession of the institution until after all212     opportunity had passed for obtaining payment through filing a claim with the commissioner,213     receiver, or liquidator.214          (c)  Upon good cause shown, the court having supervisory jurisdiction may extend the215     time in which the commissioner may serve any notice required by this chapter.216          (d)  The commissioner has the sole power to adjudicate any claim against the217     institution, its property or other assets, tangible or intangible, and to settle or compromise218     claims within the priorities set forth in Section 7-2-15.  Any action of the commissioner is219     subject to judicial review as provided in Subsection (9).220          (e)  A receiver or liquidator of the institution appointed by the commissioner has all the221     duties, powers, authority, and responsibilities of the commissioner under this section.  All222     claims against the institution shall be filed with the receiver or liquidator within the applicable223     time specified in this section and the receiver or liquidator shall adjudicate the claims as224     provided in Subsection (2)(d).225          (f)  The procedure established in this section is the sole remedy of claimants against an226     institution or its assets in the possession of the commissioner.227          (3)  With respect to a claim which appears in the books and records of an institution or228     other person in the possession of the commissioner as a secured claim, which, for purposes of229     this section is a claim that constitutes an enforceable, perfected lien, evidenced in writing, on230     the assets or other property of the institution:231          (a)  The commissioner shall allow or disallow each secured claim filed on or before the232     filing date within 30 days after receipt of the claim and shall notify each secured claimant by233     certified mail or in person of the basis for, and any conditions imposed on, the allowance or234     disallowance.235          (b)  For all allowed secured claims, the commissioner shall be bound by the terms,236     covenants, and conditions relating to the assets or other property subject to the claim, as set237     forth in the note, bond, or other security agreement which evidences the secured claim, unless238     the commissioner has given notice to the claimant of his intent to abandon the assets or other239     property subject to the secured claim at the time the commissioner gave the notice described in240     Subsection (3)(a).241          (c)  No petition for lifting the stay provided by Section 7-2-7 may be filed with respect242     to a secured claim before the claim has been filed and allowed or disallowed by the243     commissioner in accordance with Subsection (3)(a).244          (4)  With respect to all other claims other than secured claims:245          (a)  Each claim filed on or before the filing date shall be allowed or disallowed within246     180 days after the final publication of notice.247          (b)  If notice of disallowance is not served upon the claimant by the commissioner248     within 210 days after the date of final publication of notice, the claim is considered disallowed.249          (c)  The rights of claimants and the amount of a claim shall be determined as of the date250     the commissioner took possession of the institution under this chapter.  Claims based on251     contractual obligations of the institution in existence on the date of possession may be allowed252     unless the obligation of the institution is dependent on events occurring after the date of253     possession, or the amount or worth of the claim cannot be determined before any distribution254     of assets of the institution is made to claimants having the same priority under Section 7-2-15.255          (d) (i)  An unliquidated claim against the institution, including claims based on alleged256     torts for which the institution would have been liable on the date the commissioner took257     possession of the institution and any claims for a right to an equitable remedy for breach of258     performance by the institution, may be filed in an estimated amount.  The commissioner may259     disallow or allow the claim in an amount determined by the commissioner, settle the claim in260     an amount approved by the court, or, in his discretion, refer the claim to the court designated by261     Section 7-2-2 for determination in accordance with procedures designated by the court.  If the262     institution held on the date of possession by the commissioner a policy of insurance that would263     apply to the liability asserted by the claimant, the commissioner, or any receiver appointed by264     him may assign to the claimant all rights of the institution under  the insurance policy in full265     satisfaction of the claim.266          (ii)  If the commissioner finds there are or may be issues of fact or law as to the validity267     of a claim, liquidated or unliquidated, or its proper allowance or disallowance under the268     provisions of this chapter, he may appoint a hearing examiner to conduct a hearing and to269     prepare and submit recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law for final270     consideration by the commissioner.  The hearing shall be conducted as provided in rules or271     regulations issued by the commissioner.  The decision of the commissioner shall be based on272     the record before the hearing examiner and information the commissioner considers relevant273     and shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Subsection (9).274          (e)  A claim may be disallowed if it is based on actions or documents intended to275     deceive the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him.276          (f)  The commissioner may defer payment of any claim filed on behalf of a person who277     was at any time in control of the institution within the meaning of Section 7-1-103, pending the278     final determination of all claims of the institution against that person.279          (g)  The commissioner or any receiver appointed by him may disallow a claim that280     seeks a dollar amount if it is determined by the court having jurisdiction under Section 7-2-2281     that the commissioner or receiver or conservator will not have any assets with which to pay the282     claim under the priorities established by Section 7-2-15.283          (h)  The commissioner may adopt rules to establish such alternative dispute resolution284     processes as may be appropriate for the resolution of claims filed against an institution under285     this chapter.286          (i)  In establishing alternative dispute resolution processes, the commissioner shall287     strive for procedures that are expeditious, fair, independent, and low cost.  The commissioner288     shall seek to develop incentives for claimants to participate in the alternative dispute resolution289     process.290          (j)  The commissioner may establish both binding and nonbinding processes, which291     may be conducted by any government or private party, but all parties, including the claimant292     and the commissioner or any receiver appointed by him, must agree to the use of the process in293     a particular case.294          (5)  Claims filed after the filing date are disallowed, unless:295          (a)  the claimant who did not file his claim timely demonstrates that he did not have296     notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in time to file a timely proof of claim; and297          (b)  proof of the claim was filed prior to the last distribution of assets.  For the purpose298     of this subsection only, late filed claims may be allowed if proof was filed before the final299     distribution of assets of the institution to claimants of the same priority and are payable only300     out of the remaining assets of the institution.301          (c)  A late filed claim may be disallowed under any other provision of this section.302          (6)  Debts owing to the United States or to any state or its subdivisions as a penalty or303     forfeiture are not allowed, except for the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act,304     transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose.305          (7)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection 7-2-15(1)(a), interest accruing on any306     claim after the commissioner has taken possession of an institution or other person under this307     chapter may be disallowed.308          (8) (a)  A claim against an institution or its assets based on a contract or agreement may309     be disallowed unless the agreement:310          [(a)] (i) is in writing;311          [(b)] (ii) is otherwise a valid and enforceable contract; and312          [(c)] (iii) has continuously, from the time of its execution, been an official record of the313     institution.314          (b)  The requirements of this Subsection (8) do not apply to claims for goods sold or315     services rendered to an institution in the ordinary course of business by trade creditors who do316     not customarily use written agreements or other documents.317          (9) (a)  Objection to any claim allowed or disallowed may be made by any depositor or318     other claimant by filing a written objection with the commissioner within 30 days after service319     of the notice of allowance or disallowance.  The commissioner shall present the objection to320     the court for hearing and determination upon written notice to the claimant and to the filing321     party.  The notice shall set forth the time and place of hearing.  After the 30-day period, no322     objection may be filed.  This Subsection (9) does not apply to secured claims allowed under323     Subsection (3).324          (b)  The hearing shall be based on the record before the commissioner and any325     additional evidence the court allowed to provide the parties due process of law.326          (c)  The court may not reverse or otherwise modify the determination of the327     commissioner with respect to the claim unless it finds the determination of the commissioner to328     be arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.  The burden of proof is on the party329     objecting to the determination of the commissioner.330          (d)  An appeal from any final judgment of the court with respect to a claim may be331     taken as provided by law by the claimant, the commissioner, or any person having standing to332     object to the allowance or disallowance of the claim.333          (10)  If a claim against the institution has been asserted in any judicial, administrative,334     or other proceeding pending at the time the commissioner took possession of the institution335     under this chapter or under Chapter 19, Acquisition of Failing Depository Institutions or336     Holding Companies, the claimant shall file copies of all documents of record in the pending337     proceeding with the commissioner within the time for filing claims as provided in Subsection338     (2).  Such a claim shall be allowed or disallowed within 90 days of the receipt of the complete339     record of the proceedings.  No application to lift the stay of a pending proceeding shall be filed340     until the claim has been allowed or disallowed. The commissioner may petition the court341     designated by Section 7-2-2 to lift the stay to determine whether the claim should be allowed or342     disallowed.343          (11)  All claims allowed by the commissioner and not disallowed or otherwise modified344     by the court under Subsection (9), if not paid within 30 days after allowance, shall be345     evidenced by a certificate payable only out of the assets of the institution in the possession of346     the commissioner, subject to the priorities set forth in Section 7-2-15. This provision does not347     apply to a secured claim allowed by the commissioner under Subsection (3)(a).348          Section 2.  Section 7-17-9 is amended to read:349          7-17-9.

Use in the loan documents359     of such words as "trust" or "pledge" alone does not establish the intent of the parties; and360          (c)  There is no federal law or regulation prohibiting the payment of interest on or361     otherwise compensating the borrower for the use of the funds in such an account.362          (2)  No action seeking payment of interest on or other compensation for the use of the363     funds in any reserve account for any period prior to July 1, 1979, shall be brought after June 30,364     1981.

The542     description may be by reference to a program of the issuer which is established by the official543     or official body.544          (4)  The system shall define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered545     public obligation is effective with respect to the issuer, and by which payment of principal and546     any interest shall be made.

A copy of such official actions verified by571     an authorized officer is admissible before any court of record, administrative body, or572     arbitration panel without further authentication.573          (8)  Nothing in this act precludes conversion from one form of registered public574     obligation provided by this act to a form of obligation not provided by this act if interest on the575     converted obligation continues to be exempt from income taxation under the Code.576          (9)  Rights provided by other laws with respect to obligations in forms not provided by577     this act shall, to the extent not inconsistent with this act, apply with respect to registered public578     obligations issued in forms authorized by this act.579          Section 8.

Section 31A-22-408 is amended to read:1406          31A-22-408. Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance.1407          (1)  This section is known as the "Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance."  It1408     does not apply to group life insurance.1409          (2)  In the case of policies issued on or after July 1, 1961, no policy of life insurance,1410     except as stated in Subsection (8), may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it1411     contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the1412     opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering1413     policyholder as are the minimum requirements hereinafter specified, and are essentially in1414     compliance with Subsection (8):1415          (a)  That, in the event of default in any premium payment, after premiums have been1416     paid for at least one full year the company will grant, upon proper request not later than 60 days1417     after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated1418     in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as is specified in this section.  In1419     lieu of that stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the company may substitute, upon proper1420     request not later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially1421     equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer1422     period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment1423     benefits.1424          (b)  That, upon surrender of the policy within 60 days after the due date of any premium1425     payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of1426     ordinary insurance or five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay,1427     in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as is1428     specified in this section.1429          (c)  That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in1430     the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not1431     later than 60 days after the due date of the premium in default.1432          (d)  That, if the policy shall have been paid by the completion of all premium payments1433     or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after1434     the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in1435     the case of industrial insurance, the company will pay upon surrender of the policy within 301436     days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value in the amount specified in this section.1437          (e)  In the case of policies which cause, on a basis guaranteed in the policy, unscheduled1438     changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or1439     premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate,1440     and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits1441     available under the policy.  In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table1442     and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture1443     benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first 201444     policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to1445     be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to1446     the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy.1447          (f)  A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits1448     available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or1449     pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered; an explanation of the1450     manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by1451     the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the1452     company on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and1453     benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation1454     has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is1455     delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and1456     paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the1457     last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.1458          (g)  Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the1459     plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.1460          (h)  The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender1461     value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy with the1462     consent of the commissioner; provided, however, that the policy shall remain in full force and1463     effect until the insurer has made the payment.1464          (3) (a)  Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a1465     premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by Subsection (2),1466     shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of1467     the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any1468     existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of:1469          [(a)] (i)  the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in Subsections (5)1470     and (6), corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such1471     anniversary[,]; and1472          [(b)] (ii)  the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.1473          (b)  Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of1474     Subsection (6)(d) as defined therein, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity1475     benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or1476     supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in [the first paragraph of1477     this subsection] Subsection (3)(a) shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash1478     surrender value as defined in [such paragraph] Subsection (3)(a) for an otherwise similar policy1479     issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash1480     surrender value as defined in [such paragraph] Subsection (3)(a) for a policy which provides1481     only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.1482          (c)  Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of1483     Subsection (6)(d) as defined therein, which defines a primary insured and provides term1484     insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age 71,1485     the cash surrender value referred to in [the first paragraph of this subsection] Subsection (3)(a)1486     shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in [such1487     paragraph] Subsection (3)(a) for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without1488     such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in [such1489     paragraph] Subsection (3)(a) for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided1490     by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.1491          (d)  Any cash surrender value available within 30 days after any policy anniversary1492     under any policy paid-up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued1493     under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by Subsection (2) shall be an1494     amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits1495     provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any1496     indebtedness to the company on the policy.1497          (4)  Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default1498     in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of1499     such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the1500     policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by1501     this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a1502     specified period.1503          (5) (a) (i)  This Subsection (5)[(a)] does not apply to policies issued on or after the1504     operative date of Subsection (6)(d) as defined therein.1505          (ii)  Except as provided in Subsection (5)(c), the adjusted premiums for any policy shall1506     be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective1507     premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged1508     because of impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the1509     policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:1510          [(i)] (A)  the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the1511     policy;1512          [(ii)] (B)  2% of the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of1513     the equivalent uniform amount if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;1514          [(iii)] (C)  40% of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; and1515          [(iv)] (D)  25% of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted1516     premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with1517     uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of1518     insurance, whichever is less.1519          (iii)  Provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in Subsections1520     (5)(a)[(iii)](ii)(C) and [(iv)] (D), no adjusted premium shall be considered to exceed 4% of the1521     amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.  The date of issue of a policy for1522     the purpose of this [section] Subsection (5) shall be the date as of which the rated age of the1523     insured is determined.1524          (b)  In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of1525     the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of this [section] Subsection1526     (5) shall be considered to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar1527     policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and1528     for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under1529     which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy;1530     provided, however, that in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued1531     on the life of a child under age 10, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though1532     the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age 10 were the1533     amount provided by such policy at age 10.1534          (c) (i)  The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider1535     or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to the sum of:1536          [(i)] (A)  the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age1537     without such term insurance benefits, increased[,]; and1538          (B)  during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable,1539     [by (ii)] the adjusted premiums for such term insurance[, the].1540          (ii)  The foregoing items [(i) and (ii) of this] (A) and (B) of Subsection (5)(c)(i) being1541     calculated separately and as specified in Subsections (5)(a) and (b) except that, for the purposes1542     of [(ii), (iii), and (iv)] (B), (C), and (D) of Subsection (5)(a)(ii), the amount of insurance or1543     equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in calculation of the adjusted premiums referred1544     to in [(ii)] (B) of [this] Subsection (5)(c)(i) shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding1545     amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted1546     premiums in [(i)] (A) of this Subsection (5)(c)(i).1547          (d)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (6), all adjusted premiums and present1548     values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the1549     basis of the Commissioner's 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any1550     category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values1551     may be calculated according to an age not more than three years younger than the actual age of1552     the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the1553     basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.  All calculations shall be made on the1554     basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding 3-1/2% per annum, specified in the policy for1555     calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.  Provided, however, that1556     in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure1557     endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be1558     not more than 130% of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table.  Provided,1559     further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted1560     premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified1561     by the company and approved by the commissioner.1562          (6) (a)  This Subsection (6)(a) does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the1563     operative date of Subsection (6)(d) as defined therein.  In the case of ordinary policies issued1564     on or after the operative date of Subsection (6)(a) as defined in Subsection (6)(b), all adjusted1565     premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the1566     Commissioner's 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest as specified in1567     the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided1568     that such rate of interest may not exceed 3-1/2% per annum for policies issued before June 1,1569     1973, 4% per annum for policies issued on or after May 31, 1973, and before April 2, 1980,1570     and the rate of interest may not exceed 5-1/2% per annum for policies issued after April 2,1571     1980, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of1572     interest not exceeding 6-1/2% per annum may be used, and provided that for any category of1573     ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be1574     calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the1575     insured.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance1576     with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of1577     mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1958 Extended1578     Term Insurance Table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the1579     calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table1580     of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.1581          (b)  Any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to1582     comply with the provisions of Subsection (6)(a) after a specified date before January 1, 1966. 1583     After filing such notice, then upon such specified date, which is the operative date of1584     Subsection (6)(a) for such company, this Subsection (6)(a) shall become operative with respect1585     to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such company.  If a company makes no such1586     election, the operative date of Subsection (6)(a) for such company is January 1, 1966.1587          (c) (i)  This Subsection (6)(c) does not apply to industrial policies issued after the1588     operative date of Subsection (6)(d) as defined therein.  In the case of industrial policies issued1589     on or after the operative date of this Subsection (6)(c) as defined herein, all adjusted premiums1590     and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the1591     Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in1592     the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided1593     that such rate of interest may not exceed 3-1/2% per annum for policies issued before June 1,1594     1973, 4% per annum for policies issued after May 31, 1973, and before April 2, 1980, and1595     5-1/2% per annum for policies issued after April 2, 1980, except that for any single premium1596     whole life or endowment insurance policy issued after April 2, 1980, a rate of interest not1597     exceeding 6-1/2% per annum may be used.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present1598     value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a1599     nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the1600     Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.  Provided, further, that for1601     insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and1602     present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the1603     company and approved by the commissioner.1604          (ii)  Any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to1605     comply with the provisions of this Subsection (6)(c) after a specified date before January 1,1606     1968.  After filing such notice, then upon that specified date, which is the operative date of this1607     Subsection (6)(c) for such company, this Subsection (6)(c) shall become operative with respect1608     to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such company.  If a company makes no such1609     election, the operative date of this Subsection (6)(c) for such company shall be January 1, 1968.1610          (d) (i)  This Subsection (6)(d) applies to all policies issued on or after the operative date1611     of this Subsection (6)(d) as defined herein.  Except as provided in Subsection (6)(d)(vii), the1612     adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such1613     uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year,1614     excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also1615     excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a1616     statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up1617     nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of policy, of all adjusted1618     premiums shall be equal to the sum of:1619          (A)  the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;1620          (B)  1% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the1621     average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years; and1622          (C)  125% of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined.  Provided,1623     however, that in applying the percentage specified in (C), no nonforfeiture net level premium1624     shall be considered to exceed 4% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform1625     in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy1626     years.  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this Subsection (6)(d) shall be the date as1627     of which the rated age of the insured is determined.1628          (ii)  The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date1629     of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the1630     present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the1631     date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls1632     due.1633          (iii)  In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled1634     changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or1635     premiums other than change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall1636     initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from1637     those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy.  At the time of any such change in the1638     benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums, and1639     present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not1640     change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.1641          (iv)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (6)(d)(vii), the recalculated future1642     adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective1643     future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts specified in1644     the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover1645     impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or1646     policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash1647     surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of1648     change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall1649     be equal to the excess of:1650          (A)  the sum of:1651          (I)  the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the1652     policy; and1653          (II)  the additional expense allowance, if any[,]; over1654          (B)  the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture1655     benefit under the policy.1656          (v)  The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined1657     benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:1658          (A)  1% of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning1659     of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of1660     insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years subsequent to1661     the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date1662     of issue of the policy; and1663          (B)  125% of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.1664          (vi)  The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to[ the result1665     obtained by dividing (A) by (B) where]:1666          (A)  [equals] the sum of:1667          (I)  the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present1668     value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or1669     subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the1670     change not occurred; and1671          (II)  the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the1672     policy; [and] divided by1673          (B)  [equals] the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each1674     anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.1675          (vii)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection (6)(d) to the contrary, in1676     the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of1677     insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an1678     otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts1679     of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be1680     calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the1681     standard basis.1682          (viii)  All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall:1683          (A)  for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of:1684          [(A)] (I)  the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table; or1685          [(B)] (II)  at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life1686     insurance, the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select1687     Mortality Factors; [shall]1688          (B)  for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the1689     Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and [shall]1690          (C)  for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a1691     rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in [this] Subsection1692     (6)(d)(x), for policies issued in that calendar year.  [Provided, however, that:]1693          (ix)  Notwithstanding Subsection (6)(d)(viii):1694          [(I)] (A)  At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a1695     particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the1696     nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in [this] Subsection (6)(d)(x), for policies issued in the1697     immediately preceding calendar year.1698          [(II)] (B)  Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend1699     additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by Subsection (2), shall1700     be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the1701     amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.1702          [(III)] (C)  A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up1703     nonforfeiture benefit, including paid-up additions under the policy, on the basis of an interest1704     rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.1705          [(IV)] (D)  In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with1706     accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality1707     assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1980 Extended Term1708     Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioner's 19611709     Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance.1710          [(V)] (E)  For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such1711     adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the1712     aforementioned tables.1713          [(VI)] (F)  Any ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National1714     Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rules adopted by the1715     commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard, may be substituted1716     for the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year1717     Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioner's 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table.1718          [(VII)] (G)  Any industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National1719     Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rules adopted by the1720     commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted1721     for the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.1722          [(ix)] (x)  The nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular1723     calendar year shall be equal to 125% of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for1724     such policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1%.1725          [(x)] (xi)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this title to the contrary, any refiling1726     of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy1727     form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute1728     nonforfeiture values does not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.1729          [(xi)] (xii)  After the effective date of this Subsection (6)(d), any company may, at any1730     time before January 1, 1989, file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to1731     comply with the provisions of this subsection with regard to any number of plans of insurance1732     after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which specified date shall be the operative date of1733     this Subsection (6)(d) for the plan or plans, but if a company elects to make the provisions of1734     this subsection operative before January 1, 1989, for fewer than all plans, the company shall1735     comply with rules adopted by the commissioner.  There is no limit to the number of times this1736     election may be made.  If the company makes no such election, the operative date of this1737     subsection for such company shall be January 1, 1989.1738          (7)  In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium1739     determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on1740     the estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such1741     nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in Subsection (2),1742     (3), (4), (5), (6)(a), (6)(b), (6)(c), or (6)(d) herein, then:1743          (a)  the insurer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the1744     benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as1745     the minimum benefits otherwise required by Subsection (2), (3), (4), (5), (6)(a), (6)(b), (6)(c),1746     or (6)(d);1747          (b)  the plan of life insurance shall satisfy the commissioner that the benefits and the1748     pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or1749     insureds; and1750          (c)  the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan1751     may not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a1752     method consistent with the principles of this Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as1753     determined by rules adopted by the commissioner.1754          (8) (a) (i)  Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available1755     under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the1756     policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of1757     fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary.1758          (ii)  All values referred to in Subsections (3), (4), (5), and (6) [of this section] may be1759     calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of1760     death.1761          (iii)  The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, may not1762     be less than the amounts used to provide such additions.1763          (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (3), additional benefits specified in1764     Subsection (8)(c) and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in1765     ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no1766     such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.1767          (c)  Additional benefits referred to in Subsection (8)(b) include benefits payable:1768          [(a)] (i)  in the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means[,];1769          [(b)] (ii)  in the event of total and permanent disability[,];1770          [(c)] (iii)  as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits[,];1771          [(d)] (iv)  as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy1772     provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply[,];1773          [(e)] (v)  as term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a1774     policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is1775     26, if uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of1776     the death of a parent of the child[,]; and1777          [(f)] (vi)  as other policy benefits additional to life insurance endowment benefits[, and1778     premiums for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender1779     values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall1780     be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits].1781          (9) (a)  This Subsection (9), in addition to all other applicable subsections of this1782     section, applies to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1985.  Any cash surrender value1783     available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy1784     anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than 2/10 of 1% of either the1785     amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of1786     insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from the sum of:1787          [(a)] (i)  the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified[,]; and1788          [(b)] (ii)  the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any1789     indebtedness to the company under the policy.1790          (b)  The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary of the1791     future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any1792     existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there1793     had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter1794     defined, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such1795     anniversary.  Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life1796     insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in Subsection (3) or (5),1797     whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in Subsection (3) or (5),1798     whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.1799          (c)  The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a1800     percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in Subsection (5) or (6)(d),1801     whichever is applicable.

The beneficiary's bank need not determine6670     whether the name and number refer to the same person.6671          [(4)] (b)  If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the6672     name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the6673     person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the6674     originator of the funds transfer.

Proof of notice may be made by any6690     admissible evidence.  The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof it if proves that the6691     originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to6692     which the notice relates.6693          [(8)] (6)  In a case governed by Subsection (2)(a), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully6694     pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from6695     the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the6696     law governing mistake and rescission as follows:6697          (a)  If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in Subsection [(5)] (3),6698     the originator has the right to recover.6699          (b)  If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the6700     originator's bank has the right to recover.6701          Section 110.
