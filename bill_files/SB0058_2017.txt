Section 7-2-12 is amended to read:76          7-2-12. Powers of commissioner in possession -- Sale of assets -- Postpossession77     financing -- New deposit instruments -- Executory contracts -- Transfer of property --78     Avoidance of transfers -- Avoidable preferences -- Setoff.79          (1)  Upon taking possession of the institution, the commissioner may do all things80     necessary to preserve its assets and business, and shall rehabilitate, reorganize, or liquidate the81     affairs of the institution in a manner he determines to be in the best interests of the institution's82     depositors and creditors.  Any such determination by the commissioner may not be overruled83     by a reviewing court unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, fraudulent, or contrary to law. 84     In the event of a liquidation, he shall collect all debts due and claims belonging to it, and may85     compromise all bad or doubtful debts.  He may sell, upon terms he may determine, any or all of86     the property of the institution for cash or other consideration.  The commissioner shall give87     such notice as the court may direct to the institution of the time and place of hearing upon an88     application to the court for approval of the sale.  The commissioner shall execute and deliver to89     the purchaser of any property of the institution sold by him those deeds or instruments90     necessary to evidence the passing of title.91          (2)  With approval of the court and upon terms and with priority determined by the92     court, the commissioner may borrow money and issue evidence of indebtedness.  To secure93     repayment of the indebtedness, he may mortgage, pledge, transfer in trust, or hypothecate any94     or all of the property of the institution superior to any charge on the property for expenses of95     the proceeding as provided in Section 7-2-14.  These loans may be obtained for the purpose of96     facilitating liquidation, protecting or preserving the assets in the charge of the commissioner,97     expediting the making of distributions to depositors and other claimants, aiding in the98     reopening or reorganization of the institution or its merger or consolidation with another99     institution, or the sale of all of its assets.  Neither the commissioner nor any special deputy or100     other person lawfully in charge of the affairs of the institution is under any personal obligation101     to repay those loans.  The commissioner may take any action necessary or proper to102     consummate the loan and to provide for its repayment and to give bond when required for the103     faithful performance of all undertakings in connection with it.  The commissioner or special104     deputy shall make application to the court for approval of any loan proposed under this section. 105     Notice of hearing upon the application shall be given as the court directs.  At the hearing upon106     the application any stockholder or shareholder of the institution or any depositor or other107     creditor of the institution may appear and be heard on the application.  Prior to the obtaining of108     a court order, the commissioner or special deputy in charge of the affairs of the institution may109     make application or negotiate for the loan or loans subject to the obtaining of the court order.110          (3)  With the approval of the court pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation111     under Section 7-2-18, the commissioner may provide for depositors to receive new deposit112     instruments from a depository institution that purchases or receives some or all of the assets of113     the institution in the possession of the commissioner.  All new deposit instruments issued by114     the acquiring depository institution may, in accordance with the terms of the plan of115     reorganization or liquidation, be subject to different amounts, terms, and interest rates than the116     original deposit instruments of the institution in the possession of the commissioner.  All117     deposit instruments issued by the acquiring institution shall be considered new deposit118     obligations of the acquiring institution.  The original deposit instruments issued by the119     institution in the possession of the commissioner are not liabilities of the acquiring institution,120     unless assumed by the acquiring institution.  Unpaid claims of depositors against the institution121     in the possession of the commissioner continue, and may be provided for in the plan of122     reorganization or liquidation.123          (4)  The commissioner, after taking possession of any institution or other person subject124     to the jurisdiction of the department, may terminate any executory contract, including standby125     letters of credit, unexpired leases and unexpired employment contracts, to which the institution126     or other person is a party.  If the termination of an executory contract or unexpired lease127     constitutes a breach of the contract or lease, the date of the breach is the date on which the128     commissioner took possession of the institution.  Claims for damages for breach of an129     executory contract shall be filed within 30 days of receipt of notice of the termination, and if130     allowed, shall be paid in the same manner as all other allowable claims of the same priority out131     of the assets of the institution available to pay claims.132          (5)  With approval of the court and upon a showing by the commissioner that it is in the133     best interests of the depositors and creditors, the commissioner may transfer property on134     account of an indebtedness incurred by the institution prior to the date of the taking.135          (6) (a)  The commissioner may avoid any transfer of any interest of the institution in136     property or any obligation incurred by the institution that is void or voidable by a creditor under137     Title 25, Chapter 6, Uniform [Fraudulent Transfer] Voidable Transactions Act.138          (b)  The commissioner may avoid any transfer of any interest in real property of the139     institution that is void as against or voidable by a subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a140     valuable consideration of the same real property or any portion thereof who has duly recorded141     his conveyance at the time possession of the institution is taken, whether or not such a142     purchaser exists.143          (c)  The commissioner may avoid any transfer of any interest in property of the144     institution or any obligation incurred by the institution that is invalid or void as against, or is145     voidable by a creditor that extends credit to the institution at the time possession of the146     institution is taken by the commissioner, and that obtains, at such time and with respect to such147     credit, a judgment lien or a lien by attachment, levy, execution, garnishment, or other judicial148     lien on the property involved, whether or not such a creditor exists.149          (d)  The right of the commissioner under Subsections (6)(b) and (c) to avoid any150     transfer of any interest in property of the institution shall be unaffected by and without regard151     to any knowledge of the commissioner or of any creditor of the institution.152          (e)  "Transfer" means every mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary153     or involuntary, or disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property,154     including retention of title as a security interest.155          (f)  The commissioner may avoid and recover any payment or other transfer of any156     interest in property of the institution to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an157     antecedent debt owed by the institution before the transfer was made if the creditor at the time158     of such transfer had reasonable cause to believe that the institution was insolvent, and if the159     payment or other transfer will allow the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than160     he would be entitled to under the provisions of Section 7-2-15.  For the purposes of this161     subsection:162          (i)  antecedent debt does not include earned wages and salaries and other operating163     expenses incurred and paid in the normal course of business;164          (ii)  a transfer of any interest in real property is deemed to have been made or suffered165     when it became so far perfected that a subsequent good faith purchaser of the property from the166     institution for a valuable consideration could not acquire an interest superior to the transferee;167     and168          (iii)  a transfer of property other than real property is deemed to have been made or169     suffered when it became so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract could not acquire a170     lien by attachment, levy, execution, garnishment, or other judicial lien superior to the interest171     of the transferee.172          (g)  For purposes of this section, "date of possession" means the earlier of the date the173     commissioner takes possession of a financial institution under Title 7, Chapter 2, Possession of174     Depository Institution by Commissioner, or the date when the commissioner enters an order175     suspending payments to depositors and other creditors under Section 7-2-19.176          (7) (a)  With or without the prior approval of the court, the commissioner or any federal177     deposit insurance agency appointed by him as receiver or liquidator of a depository institution178     closed by the commissioner under the provisions of this chapter may setoff against the deposits179     or other liabilities of the institution any debts or other obligations of the depositor or claimant180     due and owing to the institution.  The amount of any setoff against the liabilities of the181     institution shall be no greater than the amount the depositor or claimant would receive pursuant182     to Section 7-2-15 after final liquidation of the institution.  When the liquidation value of a183     depositor's or claimant's claim against the institution will or may be less than the full amount of184     the claim, setoff may be made prior to final liquidation if the commissioner or any receiver or185     liquidator appointed by him can reasonably estimate the liquidation value of the claim, and the186     court, after notice and opportunity for hearing, approves the estimate for purposes of making187     the setoff.  If the right of setoff is exercised, the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator188     appointed by him shall give written notice to the depositor or claimant of the amount setoff.189          (b)  The existence and amount of a debtor or creditor relationship or both, between the190     institution and its depositor or claimant and the right to the proceeds in a deposit account shall191     be determined solely by the books and records of the institution.192          (c)  Any contract purporting to affect the right of setoff shall be in writing and signed by193     the depositor-debtor and an authorized officer of the institution and be maintained as a part of194     the records of the institution.195          (d)  Any claim that a deposit account is a special account not subject to setoff because it196     was maintained for a specific purpose or to satisfy a particular obligation other than satisfaction197     of or as security for an indebtedness to the institution or that the right to the deposit actually198     belongs to a third party does not affect the right to setoff of the commissioner or any receiver or199     liquidator appointed by him unless the special nature of the account is clearly shown in the200     books and records of the institution.201          (e)  In the absence of any other instrument in writing, the terms and provisions of the202     signature card applicable to a particular account in effect at the time the commissioner takes203     possession of the institution shall be determinative of the right of setoff by the commissioner or204     any receiver or liquidator appointed by him.205          (f)  Knowledge of the institution or of any director, officer, or employee of the206     institution that the nature of the account is other than as shown in the books and records of the207     institution does not affect the right of setoff by the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator208     appointed by him.209          (g)  The liability of the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him for210     exercising a right of setoff other than as authorized by this section shall be only to a person211     who establishes by the procedure set forth in Section 7-2-6 that his interest in the account is212     superior to that of the person whose debt to the institution was setoff against the account.  The213     amount of any such liability shall be no greater than the amount of the setoff and neither the214     commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him shall be liable for any action taken215     under this section unless the action taken is determined by the court to be arbitrary or216     capricious.217          Section 2.

Asset protection trust.635          (1)  As used in this section:636          (a)  "Creditor" means:637          (i)  a creditor or other claimant of the settlor existing when the trust is created; or638          (ii)  a person who subsequently becomes a creditor, including, whether or not reduced639     to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,640     undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured:641          (A)  one holding or seeking to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body642     having adjudicative authority; or643          (B)  one with a right to payment.644          (b)  "Property" means real property, personal property, and interests in real or personal645     property.646          (c)  "Settlor" means a person who transfers property in trust.647          (d)  "Transfer" means any form of transfer of property, including gratuitous transfers,648     whether by deed, conveyance, or assignment.649          (e)  "Trust" has the same meaning as in Section 75-1-201.650          (2)  "Paid and delivered" to the settlor, as beneficiary, does not include the settlor's use651     or occupancy of real property or tangible personal property owned by the trust if the use or652     occupancy is in accordance with the trustee's discretionary authority under the trust instrument.653          (3)  If the settlor of an irrevocable trust is also a beneficiary of the trust, and if the654     requirements of Subsection (5) are satisfied, a creditor of the settlor may not:655          (a)  satisfy a claim or liability of the settlor in either law or equity out of the settlor's656     transfer to the trust or the settlor's beneficial interest in the trust;657          (b)  force or require the trustee to make a distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary; or658          (c)  require the trustee to pay any distribution directly to the creditor, or otherwise659     attach the distribution before it has been paid or delivered by the trustee to the settlor, as660     beneficiary.661          (4)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), nothing in this section prohibits a creditor from662     satisfying a claim or liability from the distribution once it has been paid or delivered by the663     trustee to the settlor, as beneficiary.664          (5)  In order for Subsection (3) to apply, the conditions in this Subsection (5) shall be665     satisfied.  Where this Subsection (5) requires that a provision be included in the trust666     instrument, no particular language need be used in the trust instrument if the meaning of the667     trust provision otherwise complies with this Subsection (5).668          (a)  The trust instrument shall provide that the trust is governed by Utah law and is669     established pursuant to this section.670          (b)  The trust instrument shall require that at all times at least one trustee shall be a671     Utah resident or Utah trust company, as the term "trust company" is defined in Section 7-5-1.672          (c)  The trust instrument shall provide that neither the interest of the settlor, as673     beneficiary, nor the income or principal of the trust may be voluntarily or involuntarily674     transferred by the settlor, as beneficiary.  The provision shall be considered to be a restriction675     on the transfer of the settlor's beneficial interest in the trust that is enforceable under applicable676     nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of Section 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.677          (d)  The settlor may not have the ability under the trust instrument to revoke, amend, or678     terminate all or any part of the trust, or to withdraw property from the trust, without the consent679     of a person who has a substantial beneficial interest in the trust, which interest would be680     adversely affected by the exercise of the power held by the settlor.681          (e)  The trust instrument may not provide for any mandatory distributions of either682     income or principal to the settlor, as beneficiary, except as provided in Subsection (7)(f).683          (f)  The settlor may not benefit from, direct a distribution of, or use trust property684     except as stated in the trust instrument.  An agreement or understanding, express or implied,685     between the settlor and the trustee that attempts to grant or permit the retention of greater rights686     or authority than is stated in the trust instrument is void.687          (g)  The trust instrument shall require that, at least 30 days before making any688     distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary, the trustee notify in writing every person who has a689     child support judgment or order against the settlor.  The trust instrument shall require that the690     notice state the date the distribution will be made and the amount of the distribution.691          (h)  At the time that the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not be in692     default of making a payment due under any child support judgment or order.693          (i)  A transfer of assets to the trust may not render the settlor insolvent.694          (j)  At the time the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not intend to695     hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor by transferring the assets to the trust.  A settlor's696     expressed intention to protect trust assets from the settlor's potential future creditors is not697     evidence of an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor.698          (k)  At the time that the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not be699     contemplating filing for relief under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.700          (l)  Assets transferred to the trust may not be derived from unlawful activities.701          (m)  At the time the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor shall sign a sworn702     affidavit stating that:703          (i)  the settlor has full right, title, and authority to transfer the assets to the trust;704          (ii)  the transfer of the assets to the trust will not render the settlor insolvent;705          (iii)  the settlor does not intend to hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor by706     transferring the assets to the trust;707          (iv)  there are no pending or threatened court actions against the settlor, except for those708     court actions identified by the settlor on an attachment to the affidavit;709          (v)  the settlor is not involved in any administrative proceedings, except those710     administrative proceedings identified on an attachment to the affidavit;711          (vi)  at the time of the transfer of the assets to the trust, the settlor is not in default of a712     child support obligation;713          (vii)  the settlor does not contemplate filing for relief under the provisions of the714     Bankruptcy Code; and715          (viii)  the assets being transferred to the trust were not derived from unlawful activities.716          (6)  Failure to satisfy the requirements of Subsection (5) shall result in the717     consequences described in this Subsection (6).718          (a)  If any requirement of Subsections (5)(a) through (g) is not satisfied, none of the719     property held in the trust will at any time have the benefit of the protections described in720     Subsection (3).721          (b)  If the trustee does not send the notice required under Subsection (5)(g), the court722     may authorize any person with a child support judgment or order against the settlor to whom723     notice was not sent to attach the distribution or future distributions, but the person may not:724          (i)  satisfy a claim or liability in either law or equity out of the settlor's transfer to the725     trust or the settlor's beneficial interest in the trust; or726          (ii)  force or require the trustee to make a distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary.727          (c)  If any requirement set forth in Subsections (5)(h) through (m) is not satisfied, the728     property transferred to the trust that does not satisfy the requirement may not have the benefit729     of the protections described in Subsection (3).730          (7)  The provisions of Subsection (3) may apply to a trust even if:731          (a)  the settlor serves as a cotrustee or as an advisor to the trustee, provided that the732     settlor may not participate in the determination as to whether a discretionary distribution will733     be made;734          (b)  the settlor has the authority under the terms of the trust instrument to appoint735     nonsubordinate advisors or trust protectors who can remove and appoint trustees and who can736     direct, consent to, or disapprove distributions;737          (c)  the settlor has the power under the terms of the trust instrument to serve as an738     investment director or to appoint an investment director under Section 75-7-906;739          (d)  the trust instrument gives the settlor the power to veto a distribution from the trust;740          (e)  the trust instrument gives the settlor a testamentary nongeneral power of741     appointment or similar power;742          (f)  the trust instrument gives the settlor the right to receive the following types of743     distributions:744          (i)  income, principal, or both in the discretion of a person, including a trustee, other745     than the settlor;746          (ii)  principal, subject to an ascertainable standard set forth in the trust;747          (iii)  income or principal from a charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable748     remainder unitrust, as defined in 26 U.S.C. 664;749          (iv)  a percentage of the value of the trust each year as determined under the trust750     instrument, but not exceeding the amount that may be defined as income under 26 U.S.C.751     643(b);752          (v)  the transferor's potential or actual use of real property held under a qualified753     personal residence trust, or potential or actual possession of a qualified annuity interest, within754     the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 2702 and the accompanying regulations; and755          (vi)  income or principal from a grantor retained annuity trust or grantor retained756     unitrust that is allowed under 26 U.S.C. 2702; or757          (g)  the trust instrument authorizes the settlor to use real or personal property owned by758     the trust.759          (8)  If a trust instrument contains the provisions described in Subsections (5)(a) through760     (g), the transfer restrictions prevent a creditor or other person from asserting any cause of761     action or claim for relief against a trustee of the trust or against others involved in the762     counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of the trust for conspiracy to commit763     fraudulent conveyance, aiding and abetting a fraudulent conveyance, participation in the trust764     transaction, or similar cause of action or claim for relief.  For purposes of this subsection,765     counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of the trust includes the preparation and766     funding of a limited partnership, a limited liability company, or other entity if interests in the767     entity are subsequently transferred to the trust.  The creditor and other person prevented from768     asserting a cause of action or claim for relief may assert a cause of action against, and are769     limited to recourse against, only:770          (a)  the trust and the trust assets; and771          (b)  the settlor, to the extent otherwise allowed in this section.772          (9)  A cause of action or claim for relief regarding a fraudulent transfer of a settlor's773     assets under Subsection (5)(j) is extinguished unless the action under Subsection (5)(j) is774     brought by a creditor of the settlor who was a creditor of the settlor before the assets referred to775     in Subsection (5)(j) were transferred to the trust and the action under Subsection (5)(j) is776     brought within the earlier of:777          (a)  the later of:778          (i)  two years after the transfer is made; or779          (ii)  one year after the transfer is or reasonably could have been discovered by the780     creditor if the creditor:781          (A)  can demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the creditor asserted a782     specific claim against the settlor before the transfer; or783          (B)  files another action, other than an action under Subsection (5)(j), against the settlor784     that asserts a claim based on an act or omission of the settlor that occurred before the transfer,785     and the action described in this Subsection (9) is filed within two years after the transfer.786          (b) (i)  with respect to a creditor known to the settlor, 120 days after the date on which787     notice of the transfer is mailed to the creditor, which notice shall state the name and address of788     the settlor, the name and address of the trustee, and also describe the assets that were789     transferred, but does not need to state the value of those assets if the assets are other than cash,790     and which shall inform the creditor that he is required to present his claim to both the settlor791     and the trustee within 120 days from the mailing of the notice or be forever barred; or792          (ii)  with respect to a creditor not known to the settlor, 120 days after the date on which793     notice of the transfer is first published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in794     which the settlor then resides, which notice shall state the name and address of the settlor, the795     name and address of the trustee, and also describe the assets that were transferred, but does not796     need to state the value of those assets if the assets are other than cash.797          (10)  The notice required in Subsection (9)(b) shall be published in accordance with the798     provisions of Section 45-1-101 for three consecutive weeks and inform creditors that they are799     required to present claims within 120 days from the first publication of the notice or be forever800     barred.801          (11) (a)  A trust is subject to this section if it is governed by Utah law, as provided in802     Section 75-7-107, and if it otherwise meets the requirements of this section.803          (b)  A court of this state has exclusive jurisdiction over an action or claim for relief that804     is based on a transfer of property to a trust that is the subject of this section.805          Section 23.
