guidelines established by the Utah Sentencing Commission pursuant to496     Subsection 63M-7-404(4), unless the judge determines that:497          (A)  the defendant needs substance abuse or mental health treatment, as determined by a498     validated risk and needs screening and assessment, that warrants treatment services that are499     immediately available in the community; or500

Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health for treatment at the Utah State Hospital as508     a condition of probation or stay of sentence, only after the superintendent of the Utah State509
