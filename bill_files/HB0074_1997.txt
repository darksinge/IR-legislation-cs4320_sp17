This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                  A      , as renumbered and amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                      A      , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                      A      , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                      A      , as last amended by Chapters     and    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section    A       is amended to read                  A      .  Purpose of part.                   The purpose of this part is to provide a method whereby county service areas may be          created.                   County service areas shall be initially created in unincorporated geographical areas in          the various counties  which will  to enable those areas to receive special types of service not          common to the entire county and establish a system for the payment of the costs entailed.                   The Legislature finds that the necessity for establishing these county service areas is          a result of the growth in unincorporated areas of some counties.  As a result of the large population          growth and intensive residential, commercial, and industrial development in unincorporated areas,          extended governmental services are needed.                   The Legislature recognizes the duty of counties as instruments of state government to           meet adequately the needs of unincorporated areas, and also recognizes that unincorporated areas         should pay for the extended services provided.                  The Legislature recognizes that the services provided by a county service area may also         be extended to incorporated areas of the county at the request of the municipality and pursuant to         procedures set forth in this part.             Section  .  Section    A       is amended to read                 A      .
