Section  
30-3-10

 is amended to read:
            
25

    
     30-3-10.  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce -- Custody
            
26

    
 consideration.
            
27

    
    (1)  If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is
            
28

    
declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the
            
29

    
minor children as it considers appropriate.

            
30


    
    (a)  In determining any form of custody, including a change in custody, the court shall
            
31

    
consider the best interests of the child without preference for either the mother or father solely
            
32

    
because of the biological sex of the parent and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the
            
33

    
following:
            
34

    
    (i)  the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties;
            
35

    
    (ii)  which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including
            
36

    
allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent;
            
37

    
    (iii)  the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth, quality,
            
38

    
and nature of the relationship between a parent and child; and
            
39

    
    (iv)  those factors outlined in Section 

30-3-10.2

.
            
40

    
    (b) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody, as defined in
            
41

    
Section 

30-3-10.1

, is in the best interest of the child, except in cases where there is:
            
42

    
    (i)  domestic violence in the home or in the presence of the child;
            
43

    
    (ii)  special physical or mental needs of a parent or child, making joint legal custody
            
44

    
unreasonable;
            
45

    
    (iii)  physical distance between the residences of the parents, making joint decision
            
46

    
making impractical in certain circumstances; or
            
47

    
    (iv)  any other factor the court considers relevant including those listed in this section
            
48

    
and Section 

30-3-10.2

.
            
49

    
    (c)  The person who desires joint legal custody shall file a proposed parenting plan in
            
50

    
accordance with Sections 

30-3-10.8

 and 

30-3-10.9

.  A presumption for joint legal custody may
            
51

    
be rebutted by a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is not in the best interest of
            
52

    
the child.
            
53

    
    (d)  The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact
            
54

    
determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the
            
55

    
children be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.
            
56

    
    (e)  The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children's
            
57

    
desires regarding future custody or parent-time schedules, but the expressed desires are not

            
58


    
controlling and the court may determine the children's custody or parent-time otherwise.  The
            
59

    
desires of a child [16] 14 years of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single
            
60

    
controlling factor.
            
61

    
    (f)  If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection
            
62

    
(1)(e), they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be
            
63

    
obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only
            
64

    
method to ascertain the child's desires regarding custody.
            
65

    
    (2)  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds
            
66

    
relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing
            
67

    
the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds
            
68

    
appropriate.
            
69

    
    (3)  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court shall
            
70

    
take that evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other
            
71

    
parent.
            
72

    
    (4) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), a court may not discriminate against a
            
73

    
parent due to a disability, as defined in Section 

57-21-2

, in awarding custody or determining
            
74

    
whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.
            
75

    
    (b)  If a court takes a parent's disability into account in awarding custody or determining
            
76

    
whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody,
            
77

    
the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising from the
            
78

    
disability by showing that:
            
79

    
    (i)  the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent's ability to
            
80

    
provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue; or
            
81

    
    (ii)  the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources
            
82

    
available to supplement the parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of
            
83

    
the child at issue.
            
84

    
    (c)  Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under
            
85

    
Title 78B, Chapter 6, Part 1, Utah Adoption Act.

            
86


    
    (5)  This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint
            
87

    
physical custody or sole physical custody, but allows the court and the family the widest
            
88

    
discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.
