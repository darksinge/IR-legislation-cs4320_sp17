It is the intent of the Legislature that Courts  implement the recommendation noted in the Annual  Accounts Receivable Report and approved by the  Advisory Board to the Office of State Debt Collection.   Courts will work with the Office of State Debt Collection  to develop a plan of action whereby delinquent accounts  can be transferred to the Office of State Debt Collection  or its designee when an account is    to    days  delinquent. Because of the Courts primary focus on  adjudication and limited collection resources, the  Legislature questions whether delinquent accounts can be  collected timely if left with the Courts.  The Office of  State Debt Collection will be responsible to provide  information as to the status of the transferred accounts so  that appropriate judicial action can take place as required.                      It is the intent of the Legislature that the Judicial  Council coordinate a study of justice court issues and  propose necessary legislation for the      General  Session.

The group should consider the future  role of justice courts in the judicial system, and propose  any legislative changes necessary to promote stability in  planning and revenue, equitable revenue distribution,  judicial independence and exclusive jurisdiction.

The purpose of this program    should be to expand inmate employment in construction related  fields in order to provide training for the inmate and a cost savings  to the State.  The program should be able to identify specific areas  for application to state owned projects, with emphasis on  correctional facilities.  The program plan should identify specific  project savings with any offsetting costs necessary to achieve those  savings.  The facility budgets for FY      should be prepared to  include those components specific to inmate labor, with   identification of the components and the anticipated savings.                      It is the intent of the Legislature that the Division of Facilities  Construction and Management  DFCM , in conjunction with the  Executive Director of the Department of Administrative Services,  proceed with a fundamental redesign of all work processes,  policies, and procedures.  The ultimate goals and objectives of this  effort should be to generate project savings that will reflect in lower  bids, fewer change orders, minimal draws on reserve accounts,  accelerated project completions, and a quality finished project. This  should also include a review of alternative methods to deliver  services and recover costs contained in this appropriation.  DFCM  and the Building Board shall also evaluate statutory requirements  affecting its delivery of services and propose legislation to address  them in the      legislative session.  To the extent necessary to  address the time period for this review and implementation of  alternatives, DFCM is authorized to expend up to     ,    from  the Project Reserve Fund. This will be done with the concurrence of  the Building Board and the Executive Director of the Department of  Administrative Services and subject to annual review by the Capital  Facilities and Administrative Services Appropriations  Subcommittee.  ITEM          To Department of Administrative Services   Division of Facilities               Construction and Management   Facilities Management          From General Fund                 ,   ,               From Dedicated Credits Revenue                  ,               Schedule of Programs               Capitol Hill               ,   ,                   Governor s Mansion            ,                   Preventive Maintenance            ,                           It is the intent of the Legislature that the Division of Facilities  Construction and Management pursue other methods of funding for  the preventive maintenance personnel.  ITEM          To Department of Administrative Services   Office of Debt Collection          From General Fund                   ,               From Dedicated Credits Revenue                   ,               Schedule of Programs               Statewide Debt Coordination             ,                           It is the intent of the Legislature that funds for the Office of  Debt Collection be nonlapsing.                       It is the intent of the Legislature that the Office of Debt Collection may use up to     ,    of revenue collected from  delinquent accounts to match funding from the Division of Finance  for procurement of Advantage  .  to implement the Advanced  Receivable subsystem of FINET.  The Dedicated Credits from the  Office of Debt Collection should be expended prior to any General  Fund expenditures.  Any General Fund remaining should be used  for the warrant reconciliation system if necessary.                       It is the intent of the Legislature that after administrative costs  and disbursements to required restrictive accounts, all collections of  accounts receivable by the State Office of Debt Collection shall be  allocated to the revenue types that generated the receivable.                      It is the intent of the Legislature that all state agencies, except  institutions of higher education, are to work with the Office of State  Debt Collection to aggressively collect, accurately account for, and  report all state receivables.  To effectively accomplish this, state  agencies are to be brought onto the state s advanced accounts  receivable system during FY      unless the advisory board to the  Office of State Debt Collection authorizes the use of in house    systems already in place.  These systems must provide proper  accounting and reporting of receivables and facilitate timely  collection of monies due the state.                      To insure consistency and help eliminate duplication of  resources in the reporting and collecting of state receivables, the  State Office of Debt Collection and its advisory board shall have  the opportunity to review and comment on state agency budget  requests for collection and receivable systems and functions.                       It is the intent of the Legislature that the Office of State Debt  Collection be authorized to establish by rule that reasonable cost of  collection be passed on to the debtor including legal and  administrative costs unless inappropriate or prohibited by law.                      It is the intent of the Legislature that Courts implement the  recommendation noted in the Annual Accounts Receivable Report  and approved by the Advisory Board to the Office of State Debt  Collection.  Courts will work with the Office of State Debt  Collection to develop a plan of action whereby delinquent accounts  can be transferred to the Office of State Debt Collection or its  designee.  The time of transfer will be negotiated with the Courts  based on a time determined to be in the state s best interest but not  later than    days past the payment demand date.  Because of the  Courts primary focus of adjudication and limited collection  resources, the Legislature questions whether delinquent accounts  can be collected timely if left with the Courts.  The Office of State  Debt Collection will be responsible to provide timely information  as to the status of the transferred accounts so that appropriate  judicial action can take place as required.                      To provide the Tax Commission with additional resources to  maximize the collection of delinquent accounts that are greater than     months old, the Tax Commission shall be included in the state s  RFP process to solicit out source collection services.  Procedures  shall be structured in such a way to allow the Tax Commission to  work directly with the out source vendors on the collection of    delinquent taxes.  It is the intent of the Legislature that the Tax  Commission work toward out sourcing all accounts over    months  old that are not in litigation, under a payment agreement, assigned  to a collector for active collection or whose out sourcing would be  in violation of state or federal law.  The Tax Commission shall  report the results of out sourcing efforts to the Office of Debt  Collection.                      It is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies provide to  the Office of State Debt Collection current annotated law, either  State or Federal, that prohibits the agency from complying with  rules established by the Office of State Debt Collection for  delinquent accounts receivable write off.  In absence of such law it  is the intent of the Legislature that state agencies will comply with  rules established for write off.  It is further the intent of the  Legislature that accounts receivable, when written off, be pursued  for collection by the Office of State Debt Collection or its  designee s  until all remedies for collection have been exhausted.                      It is the intent of the Legislature that the Office of State Debt  Collection designate by rule the policies and procedures to be  followed by the Office of State Debt Collection in administering  adjudicative proceedings as outlined in Title   , chapter   b,  Administrative Procedures Act.  The Office of State Debt  Collection will provide requested administrative hearings for state  agencies transferring accounts to the Office of State Debt  Collection or its designee when the State agency has no  administrative hearing process.  Accounts transferred from state  agencies that have established administrative hearing processes will  be referred back to the sending agency for handling.

The list is not intended to be comprehensive as                the Division is mandated to assign a charge for all services                performed and there is potentially an unlimited number of                      procedures that could be provided.  If unlisted services are                      performed, charges consistent with the private sector will be                assigned.  For FY     , an increase of   percent is projected based                on the Medical Inflation Rate for FY      for physician                      services determined by the Utah Department of Health,                      Division of Health Care Financing.
