 LONG TITLE
            
10

    
 General Description:
            
11

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature urges the United States House of
            
12

    
Representatives to pass H.R. 3179, the Marketplace Equity Act of 2011, and urges the
            
13

    
United States Senate to pass S. 1832, the Marketplace Fairness Act.
            
14

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
15

    
    This resolution:
            
16

    
    .    urges the United States House of Representatives to pass H.R. 3179, the
            
17

    
Marketplace Equity Act of 2011, and urges the United States Senate to pass S.
            
18

    
1832, the Marketplace Fairness Act, without delay; and
            
19

    
    .    declares that, through passage of these pieces of legislation, the United States
            
20

    
Congress will help level the playing field between traditional brick and mortar
            
21

    
retailers and Internet-based retailers.
            
22

    
 Special Clauses:
            
23

    
    None
            
24

    

            
25

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
26

    
    WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States established in its 1992, Quill v.
            
27

    
North Dakota decision that states cannot, of their own accord, require out-of-state retailers to

            
28


    
collect sales taxes;
            
29

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court also declared in the same ruling that
            
30

    
Congress could exercise its authority under the Commerce Clause of the United States
            
31

    
Constitution to decide "whether, when, and to what extent" the states may require sales tax
            
32

    
collection on remote sales;
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, Utah municipalities receive a majority of operating revenue from sales
            
34

    
taxes collected by brick and mortar businesses, online vendors with a nexus in the state, and
            
35

    
use taxes collected by the Utah State Tax Commission on purchases made online through
            
36

    
vendors without a brick and mortar location in the state;
            
37

    
    WHEREAS, remittance of use taxes not collected by the vendor from online purchases
            
38

    
puts an undue burden and widely unknown obligation on consumers;
            
39

    
    WHEREAS, the state of Utah has taken all necessary steps to prepare for collecting
            
40

    
online sales taxes by making remittance of sales taxes as simple as possible for online vendors;
            
41

    
    WHEREAS, the traditional legal measures of a physical presence or a nexus create an
            
42

    
unlevel playing field between Internet-based retailers and Utah-based retailers, who are rooted
            
43

    
and invested in the community;
            
44

    
    WHEREAS, the unlevel playing field and tax collection loophole given to online-only
            
45

    
retailers starves local economies of precious resources for providing services such as schools,
            
46

    
public safety, and infrastructure; and
            
47

    
    WHEREAS, local brick and mortar retailers serve as a foundation of our economy and
            
48

    
are permanent, engaged members of the community who employ our citizens, support
            
49

    
neighborhood charities and organizations, and contribute to cities:
            
50

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
51

    
urges the United States House of Representatives to pass H.R. 3179, the Marketplace Equity
            
52

    
Act of 2011, and urges the United States Senate to pass S. 1832, the Marketplace Fairness Act,
            
53

    
without delay. 
            
54

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah declares that,
            
55

    
through passage of these pieces of legislation, the United States Congress will help level the
            
56

    
playing field between traditional brick and mortar retailers and Internet-based retailers.
            
57

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Speaker of
            
58

    
the United States House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the United States Senate,

            
59


    
the Utah State Tax Commission, the Utah Department of Commerce, and to the members of
            
60

    
Utah's congressional delegation.
