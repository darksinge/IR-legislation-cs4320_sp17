109

    
    (2)  A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, other

111

    
    (3) (a)  An agency is bound by any obligation it affirmatively assumes in an
            
112

    
environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an
            
113

    
environmental covenant.

            
114


    
    (b)  Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations
            
115

    
the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations,
            
116

    
rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided
            
117

    
in the covenant.

120

    
    (a)  An interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental
            
121

    
covenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant.
            
122

    
    (b)  This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that
            
123

    
interest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant.
            
124

    
    (c) (i)  A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant
            
125

    
covering real property or in a separate record.
            
126

    
    (ii)  If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common
            
127

    
interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board
            
128

    
of the owners' association.
            
129

    
    (d)  An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental
            
130

    
covenant affects the priority of that person's interest but does not by itself impose any
            
131

    
affirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant.
