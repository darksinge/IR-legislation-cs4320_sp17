    Section 1.  
Section  
10-1-302

 is amended to read:
            
60

    
     10-1-302.  Purpose and intent.
            
61

    
    The Legislature finds that:
            
62

    
    (1)  the energy industry has previously been highly regulated and monopolistic;
            
63

    
    (2)  municipalities have historically raised town or city, respectively, general fund
            
64

    
revenues by collecting franchise and business license revenues from the energy industry;
            
65

    
    (3)  substantial restructuring of the energy industry has created an opportunity for
            
66

    
increased competition within the energy industry;
            
67

    
    (4)  the restructuring of the energy industry has diminished the effectiveness and
            
68

    
fairness of the revenues collected by municipalities;
            
69

    
    (5)  to provide for a stable revenue source for municipalities and to create a more
            
70

    
competitive environment for the energy industry, it is necessary to enact taxing authority for
            
71

    
municipalities that accomplishes those goals; and
            
72

    
    (6)  this part does not alter or affect the municipalities' authority to grant or regulate
            
73

    
franchises, or to control municipal streets, highways, or other property.
            
74
