    (Aa)  include a third transition team, appointed by the local school board of the

            
152


    
municipality's school district, to represent that school district; and

    (Bb)  require allocation of the existing district's assets and liabilities among the new
            
154

    
district, the remaining district, and the municipality's school district.

162

calculates the five-year projected average annual cost, including overhead, of governmental
            
165

    
services in the proposed new school district including:

quality of school district services being provided to the existing school district at the time of
