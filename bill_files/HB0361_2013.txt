call is to protect the victim and enforce the law.
            
30

    
    (2) (a)  In addition to the arrest powers described in Section 

77-7-2

, when a peace

32

    
domestic violence has been committed, the peace officer shall arrest without a warrant or shall
            
33

    
issue a citation to any person that the peace officer has probable cause to believe has committed

37

    
recently caused serious bodily injury or used a dangerous weapon in the domestic violence

enforcement.

            
59
