The modified net premiums650     for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for651     such benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such modified net652     premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of such benefits provided for by653     the policy and the excess of Subsection (1)(a) over Subsection (1)(b), as follows:654          (a)  A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of such655     benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of656     issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of657     such policy on which a premium falls due; provided, however, that such net level annual658     premium may not exceed the net level annual premium on the 19 year premium whole life plan659     for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy.660          (b)  A net one year term premium for such benefits provided for in the first policy year.661          (2) (a)  Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1997, for662     which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for663     which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which664     provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an665     amount greater than such excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioner's reserve666     valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date667     defined [herein] in this Subsection (2) as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any668     endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than such excess669     premium shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 31A-17-511, be the greater of the670     reserve as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in Subsection (1) and the reserve671     as of such policy anniversary calculated as described in that subsection, but with:672          [(a)] (i)  the value defined in Subsection (1)(a) being reduced by 15% of the amount of673     such excess first year premium;674          [(b)  all] (ii)  the present values of benefits and premiums being determined without675     reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date;676          [(c)] (iii)  the policy being assumed to mature on such date as an endowment; and677          [(d)] (iv)  the cash surrender value provided on such date being considered as an678     endowment benefit.679          (b)  In making the [above] comparison described in Subsection (2)(a), the mortality and680     interest bases stated in Sections 31A-17-504 and 31A-17-506 shall be used.681          (3)  Reserves according to the commissioner's reserve valuation method for:682          (a)  life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the683     payment of varying premiums;684          (b)  group annuity and pure endowment contracts  purchased under a retirement plan or685     plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a686     partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan687     providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under Section 408,688     Internal Revenue Code;689          (c)  accident and health and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and690          (d)  [all] other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance691     policies and benefits provided by [all] other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be692     calculated by a method consistent with the principles of Subsections (1) and (2).693          Section 9.

Section 31A-17-510 is amended to read:704          31A-17-510. Optional reserve calculation.705          (1)  Reserves for [all] policies and contracts issued [prior to] before January 1, 1994,706     may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce707     greater aggregate reserves for [all] such policies and contracts than the minimum reserves708     required by the laws in effect immediately [prior to] before that date.  Reserves for any709     category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the commissioner, issued on or710     after January 1, 1994, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any711     standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for such category than those calculated712     according to the minimum standard [herein] provided in this part, but the rate or rates of713     interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, may714     not be [higher] greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any715     nonforfeiture benefits provided [therein] in the policy or contract.716          (2)  Any such company which at any time shall have adopted any standard of valuation717     producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard718     [herein] provided in this part may, with the approval of the commissioner, adopt any lower719     standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum [herein] provided[; provided, however,]720     in this part, except that, for the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves721     previously determined by [a qualified] the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the722     opinion required by Section [31A-17-502] 31A-17-503 may not be considered to be the723     adoption of a higher standard of valuation.724          Section 11.

The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest737     referred to in this section are those standards stated in Sections 31A-17-504 and 31A-17-506.738          (2)  Provided that for any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1997, for739     which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which740     no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for such excess and which741     provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination [thereof] of an742     endowment benefit and cash surrender value in an amount greater than such excess premium,743     [the foregoing provisions of] this section shall be applied as if the method actually used in744     calculating the reserve for such policy were the method described in Section 31A-17-507,745     ignoring Subsection 31A-17-507(2). The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a746     policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with Section747     31A-17-507, including Subsection 31A-17-507(2), and the minimum reserve calculated in748     accordance with this section.749          Section 12.

if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and1082     benefits shown in the policy is not stated [therein] in the policy, a statement that such method1083     of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the1084     policy is delivered;

All calculations shall be made on the1181     basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding 3-1/2% per annum, specified in the policy for1182     calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.  Provided, however, that1183     in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure1184     endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be1185     not more than 130% of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table.  Provided,1186     further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted1187     premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified1188     by the company and approved by the commissioner.1189          (6) (a)  This Subsection (6)(a) does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the1190     operative date of Subsection (6)(d) as defined [therein] in Subsection (6)(d).

Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any1203     paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture1204     benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the1205     Commissioner's 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table. Provided, further, that for insurance1206     issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present1207     values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the company and1208     approved by the commissioner.1209          (b)  Any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to1210     comply with the provisions of Subsection (6)(a) after a specified date before January 1, 1966. 1211     After filing such notice, then upon such specified date, which is the operative date of1212     Subsection (6)(a) for such company, this Subsection (6)(a) shall become operative with respect1213     to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such company.

In the case of1217     industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this Subsection (6)(c) as defined1218     [herein] in this Subsection (6)(c), all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this1219     section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioner's 1961 Standard Industrial1220     Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender1221     values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest may not exceed1222     3-1/2% per annum for policies issued before June 1, 1973, 4% per annum for policies issued1223     after May 31, 1973, and before April 2, 1980, and 5-1/2% per annum for policies issued after1224     April 2, 1980, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy1225     issued after April 2, 1980, a rate of interest not exceeding 6-1/2% per annum may be used. 1226     Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with1227     accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality1228     assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner's 1961 Industrial Extended1229     Term Insurance Table.  Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the1230     calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table1231     of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.1232          (ii)  Any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to1233     comply with the provisions of this Subsection (6)(c) after a specified date before January 1,1234     1968.  After filing such notice, then upon that specified date, which is the operative date of this1235     Subsection (6)(c) for such company, this Subsection (6)(c) shall become operative with respect1236     to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such company.  If a company makes no such1237     election, the operative date of this Subsection (6)(c) for such company shall be January 1, 1968.1238          (d) (i)  This Subsection (6)(d) applies to all policies issued on or after the operative date1239     of this Subsection (6)(d) as defined [herein] in this Subsection (6)(d).

Provided,1251     however,] in Subsection (6)(d)(iii), except that in applying the percentage specified in this1252     Subsection (6)(d)(i)(C), no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be considered to exceed 4%1253     of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount1254     of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years.1255          (ii)  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this Subsection (6)(d) shall be the1256     date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.1257          [(ii)] (iii)  The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the1258     date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the1259     present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the1260     date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls1261     due.1262          [(iii)] (iv)  In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy1263     unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in1264     benefits or premiums other than change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present1265     values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not1266     change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy.  At the time of any such change1267     in the benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums,1268     and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums1269     do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.1270          [(iv)] (v)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (6)(d)[(vii)](viii), the1271     recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of1272     the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts1273     specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to1274     cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge1275     or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the1276     cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of1277     change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall1278     be equal to the excess of:1279          (A)  the sum of:1280          (I)  the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the1281     policy;

If the company makes no such election, the operative date of this1393     subsection for such company shall be January 1, 1989.1394          (7)  In the case of any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium1395     determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on1396     the estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance which is of such1397     nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in Subsection (2),1398     (3), (4), (5), (6)(a), (6)(b), (6)(c), or (6)(d) [herein], then:1399          (a)  the insurer shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the1400     benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as1401     the minimum benefits otherwise required by Subsection (2), (3), (4), (5), (6)(a), (6)(b), (6)(c),1402     or (6)(d);1403          (b)  the plan of life insurance shall satisfy the commissioner that the benefits and the1404     pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or1405     insureds; and1406          (c)  the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan1407     may not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a1408     method consistent with the principles of this Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as1409     determined by rules adopted by the commissioner.1410          (8) (a) (i)  Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available1411     under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the1412     policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of1413     fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary.1414          (ii)  All values referred to in Subsections (3), (4), (5), and (6) may be calculated upon1415     the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death.1416          (iii)  The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, may not1417     be less than the amounts used to provide such additions.1418          (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (3), additional benefits specified in1419     Subsection (8)(c) and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in1420     ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no1421     such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.1422          (c)  Additional benefits referred to in Subsection (8)(b) include benefits payable:1423          (i)  in the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;1424          (ii)  in the event of total and permanent disability;1425          (iii)  as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;1426          (iv)  as term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to1427     which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;1428          (v)  as term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a1429     policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is1430     26, if uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of1431     the death of a parent of the child; and1432          (vi)  as other policy benefits additional to life insurance endowment benefits.1433          (9) (a)  This Subsection (9), in addition to all other applicable subsections of this1434     section, applies to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1985.  Any cash surrender value1435     available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy1436     anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than 2/10 of 1% of either the1437     amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of1438     insurance at the beginning of each of the first 10 policy years, from the sum of:1439          (i)  the greater of zero and the basic cash value [hereinafter] specified in Subsection1440     (9)(b); and1441          (ii)  the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any1442     indebtedness to the company under the policy.1443          (b)  The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary of the1444     future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any1445     existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there1446     had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as [hereinafter]1447     defined in Subsection (9)(c), corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and1448     after such anniversary.  Provided, however, that the effects on the basic cash value of1449     supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in1450     Subsection (3) or (5), whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in1451     Subsection (3) or (5), whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that1452     subsection.1453          (c)  The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a1454     percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in Subsection (5) or (6)(d),1455     whichever is applicable.  Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this1456     paragraph, such percentage:1457          (i)  shall be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy1458     anniversary and the later of:1459          (A)  the fifth policy anniversary; and1460          (B)  the first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash1461     surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any1462     indebtedness, of at least 2/10 of 1% of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be1463     uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first 101464     policy years; and1465          (ii)  shall be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries1466     specified in Subsection (9)(a) may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.1467          (d)  Provided, that no basic cash value may be less than the value which would be1468     obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in Subsection (5) or Subsection1469     (6)(d), whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation1470     of the basic value.1471          (e)  All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this Subsection (9) shall for1472     a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in1473     demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this nonforfeiture law. 1474     The cash surrender values referred to in this Subsection (9) shall include any endowment1475     benefits provided for by the policy.1476          (f)  Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium1477     payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit1478     available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in1479     manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum1480     amounts in Subsections (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8).  The amounts of any cash surrender1481     values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits1482     such as those listed as Subsection (8)(c) shall conform with the principles of this Subsection1483     (9).1484          (10) (a)  This section does not apply to any of the following:1485          (i)  reinsurance;1486          (ii)  group insurance;1487          (iii)  pure endowment;1488          (iv)  an annuity or reversionary annuity contract;1489          (v)  a term policy of uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or1490     endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of 20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which1491     uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;1492          (vi)  a term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or1493     endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in Subsections1494     (5) and (6), is less than the adjusted premium so calculated, on a term policy of uniform1495     amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment1496     benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance, and for a term of1497     20 years or less expiring before age 71, for which uniform premiums are payable during the1498     entire term of the policy;1499          (vii)  a policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for1500     which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at1501     the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in Subsections (3), (4), (5), and (6)1502     exceeds 2-1/2% of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year; or1503          (viii)  a policy which shall be delivered outside this state through an agent or other1504     representative of the company issuing the policy.1505          (b)  For purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age of expiry for a1506     joint term insurance policy shall be the age of expiry of the oldest life.1507          (11)  The commissioner may adopt rules interpreting, describing, and clarifying the1508     application of this nonforfeiture law to any form of life insurance for which the interpretation,1509     description, or clarification is considered necessary by the commissioner, including unusual1510     and new forms of life insurance.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
