 Procedures.

            
400


    
    (1) (a)  If the division has reason to believe that an applicant for a license or a mobility
            
401

    
vehicle permit is an impaired person, the division may require one or both of the following:
            
402

403

    
submittal by the health care professional of a signed medical report indicating the results of the
            
404

    
physical examination;
            
405

    
    (ii)  a follow-up medical review of the applicant by a health care professional and
            
406

    
completion of a medical report at intervals established by the division under standards
            
407

    
recommended by the board.
            
408

    
    (b)  The format of the medical report required under Subsection (1)(a) shall be devised
            
409

    
by the division with the advice of the board and shall elicit the necessary medical information
            
410

    
to determine whether it would be a public safety hazard to permit the applicant to drive a motor
            
411

    
vehicle or mobility vehicle on the highways.
            
412

    
    (2) (a)  The division may grant a restricted license to an impaired person who is
            
413

    
otherwise qualified to obtain a license.
            
414

    
    (b)  The division may grant a restricted mobility vehicle permit to an impaired person
            
415

    
who is otherwise qualified to obtain a mobility vehicle permit.
            
416

    
    [(b)] (c)  The license or mobility vehicle permit continues in effect until its expiration

opinion of the division does not affect the applicant's ability to exercise reasonable and
            
422

    
ordinary control at all times in driving a motor vehicle upon the highway, does not prevent

granting a license or mobility vehicle permit to the applicant.
            
424

    
    (3) (a)  If an examination is required under this section, the division is not bound by the
            
425

    
recommendation of the examining health care professional but shall give fair consideration to
            
426

    
the recommendation in acting upon the application.  The criterion is whether upon all the
            
427

    
evidence it is safe to permit the applicant to drive a motor vehicle or mobility vehicle.
            
428

    
    (b)  In deciding whether to grant or deny a license or mobility vehicle permit, the
            
429

    
division may be guided by the opinion of experts in the fields of diagnosing and treating
            
430

    
mental, physical, or emotional disabilities and may take into consideration any other factors

            
431


    
that bear on the issue of public safety.
            
432

    
    (4)  Information provided under this section relating to physical, mental, or emotional
            
433

    
impairment is classified under Title 63G, Chapter 2, Government Records Access and

Management Act.
            
435
