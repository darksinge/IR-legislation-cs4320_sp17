1     COHABITANT ABUSE ACT AMENDMENTS




2    1998 GENERAL SESSION


3    STATE OF UTAH


4     Sponsor: Patricia B. Larson


5    AN ACT RELATING TO THE COHABITANT ABUSE ACT; CHANGING THE TERM

6    "PRIMARY" AGGRESSOR TO "PREDOMINANT" AGGRESSOR.

7    This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated 1953 as follows:

8    AMENDS:

9         77-36-2.2, as enacted by Chapter 300, Laws of Utah 1995

10    Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

11        Section 1.  Section  77-36-2.2 is amended to read:

12         77-36-2.2.  Powers and duties of law enforcement officers to arrest.  

13        (1)  The primary duty of  law enforcement officers responding to a domestic violence call

14    is to protect the victim and enforce the law.

15        (2) (a)  In addition to the arrest powers described in Section 77-7-2, when a peace officer

16    responds to a domestic violence call and has probable cause to believe that an act of domestic

17    violence has been committed, the peace officer shall arrest without a warrant or issue a citation to

18    any person that he has probable cause to believe has committed an act of domestic violence.

19        (b)  If the peace officer has probable cause to believe that there will be continued violence

20    against the alleged victim, or if there is evidence that the perpetrator has either recently caused

21    serious bodily injury or used a dangerous weapon in the domestic violence offense, the officer

22    shall arrest and take the alleged perpetrator into custody, and may not utilize the option of issuing

23    a citation under this section.  For purposes of this section "serious bodily injury" and "dangerous

24    weapon" mean the same as those terms are defined in Section 76-1-601.

25        (c)  If a peace officer does not immediately exercise arrest powers or initiate criminal

26    proceedings by citation or otherwise, he shall notify the victim of his or her right to initiate a

27    criminal proceeding and of the importance of preserving evidence, in accordance with the


1    requirements of Section 77-36-2.1.

2        (3)  If a law enforcement officer receives complaints of domestic violence from two or

3    more opposing persons, the officer shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine who the

4    [primary] predominant aggressor was.  If the officer determines that one person was the [primary]

5    predominant physical aggressor, the officer need not arrest the other person alleged to have

6    committed domestic violence.  In determining who the [primary] predominant aggressor  was, the

7    officer shall consider:

8        (a)  any prior complaints of domestic violence;

9        (b)  the relative severity of injuries inflicted on each person;

10        (c)  the likelihood of  future injury to each of the parties; and

11        (d)  whether one of the parties acted in self defense.  

12        (4)  A law enforcement officer  may not threaten, suggest, or otherwise indicate the

13    possible arrest of all parties in order to discourage any party's request for intervention by law

14    enforcement.

15        (5) (a)  A law enforcement officer who does not make an arrest after investigating a

16    complaint of domestic violence, or who arrests two or more parties, shall submit a detailed, written

17    report specifying the grounds for not arresting or for arresting both parties.

18        (b)  A law enforcement officer who does not make an arrest shall notify the victim of his

19    or her right to initiate a criminal proceeding and of the importance of preserving evidence.

20        (6) (a)  A law enforcement officer responding to a complaint of domestic violence shall

21    prepare an incident report that includes the officer's disposition of the case.

22        (b)  That report shall be made available to the victim, upon request, at no cost.

23        (c)  The law enforcement agency shall forward a copy of the incident report to the

24    appropriate prosecuting attorney within five days after the complaint of domestic violence

25    occurred.

26        (7)  Each law enforcement agency shall, as soon as practicable, make a written record and

27    maintain records of all incidents of domestic violence reported to it, and shall be identified by a

28    law enforcement agency code for domestic violence.
