Section  
62A-4a-201

 is amended to read:
            
309

    
     62A-4a-201.  Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of
            
310

    
 state.
            
311

    
    (1) (a) (i) Courts have recognized a general presumption that it is in the best interest and
            
312

    
welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of [his] the child's natural parents. 
            
313

    
A child's need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family
            
314

    
relationships will usually best be met by [his] the child's natural parents.
            
315

    
    (ii)  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit, and the right of parents to conceive
            
316

    
and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth
            
317

    
Amendment to the United States Constitution.
            
318

    
    (iii)  The right of a fit, competent parent to raise [his] the parent's child has long been
            
319

    
protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United States.
            
320

    
    (b)  It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty
            
321

    
to exercise primary control over the care, custody, control, supervision, upbringing, and
            
322

    
education of their children who are in their custody.
            
323

    
    (2) (a)  It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection
            
324

    
from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,
            
325

    
prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title 78,
            
326

    
Chapter 3a, Juvenile Court Act of 1996.
            
327

    
    (b)  Therefore, as a counterweight to parental rights, the state, as parens patriae, has an
            
328

    
interest in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately
            
329

    
provide for their welfare.  There are circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a
            
330

    
substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and
            
331

    
proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the welfare and protection of
            
332

    
children is the consideration of paramount importance.
            
333

    
    (3)  When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,
            
334

    
it shall take into account the child's need for protection from immediate harm.  Throughout its

neglect are involved, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way,

reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from
            
955

    
[his] the minor's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for
            
956

    
continued removal.  If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of
            
957

    
[his] the minor's parent or guardian through the provision of those services, it shall place the

            
958


    
minor with [his] the minor's parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the
            
959

    
division.
            
960

    
    (b)  In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child's
            
961

    
health,  safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.
            
962

    
    (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency
            
963

    
situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that
            
964

    
any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
965

    
    (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
966

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
967

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in [his] the child's home, return a
            
968

    
child to [his] the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the
            
969

    
offending parent or parents.
            
970

    
    (13)  The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of
            
971

    
educational neglect as described in Subsection 

78-3a-103

(1)[(s)](t)(ii).
            
972

    
    (14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it
            
973

    
shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
974

    
    (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall
            
975

    
state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
976

    
    (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for
            
977

    
the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if [he] the child were returned
            
978

    
home, it shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the
            
979

    
child, or the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural
            
980

    
requirement of this chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
981

    
    Section 13.  
Section  
78-3a-311

 is amended to read:
            
982

    
     78-3a-311.  Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.
            
983

    
    (1)  The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section 

78-3a-118

, place
            
984

    
the child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency,
            
985

    
order protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or other
            
986

    
services.
            
987

    
    (2) (a) (i) Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing,
            
988

    
and that the minor remain in the custody of the division [of Child and Family Services], it shall

            
989


    
first establish a primary permanency goal for the minor and determine whether, in view of the
            
990

    
primary permanency goal, reunification services are appropriate for the child and the child's
            
991

    
family, pursuant to Subsection (3).
            
992

    
    (ii)  When the court determines that reunification services are appropriate for the child
            
993

    
and the child's family, the court shall provide for reasonable parent-time with the parent or
            
994

    
parents from whose custody the child was removed, unless parent-time is not in the best
            
995

    
interest of the child.
            
996

    
    (iii)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
997

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
998

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to attempt to
            
999

    
rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  In all cases, the child's health, safety, and welfare
            
1000

    
shall be the court's paramount concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify
            
1001

    
should be made.
            
1002

    
    (b) (i)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a
            
1003

    
concurrent permanency goal.  The concurrent permanency goal shall include a representative
            
1004

    
list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal will be abandoned in favor of
            
1005

    
the concurrent permanency goal and an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying
            
1006

    
the primary permanency goal.
            
1007

    
    (ii)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection
            
1008

    

78-3a-312

(1)(b) within 30 days if something other than reunification is initially established as a
            
1009

    
child's primary permanency goal.
            
1010

    
    (iii) (A)  The court may amend a child's primary permanency goal before the
            
1011

    
establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 

78-3a-312

.  The court is not limited to
            
1012

    
the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event that the primary permanency goal is
            
1013

    
abandoned.
            
1014

    
    (B)  If, at anytime, the court determines that reunification is no longer a child's primary
            
1015

    
permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section
            
1016

    

78-3a-312

 within the earlier of 30 days of the court's determination or 12 months from the
            
1017

    
original removal of the child.
            
1018

    
    (c) (i)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order
            
1019

    
that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and the child's parent

            
1020


    
for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time. In
            
1021

    
providing those services, the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the division's
            
1022

    
paramount concern, and the court shall so order.
            
1023

    
    (ii)  The court shall determine whether the services offered or provided by the division
            
1024

    
under the treatment plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division.  The court
            
1025

    
shall also determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the treatment plan. 
            
1026

    
Those duties and responsibilities shall be identified on the record, for the purpose of assisting
            
1027

    
in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with
            
1028

    
state and federal law.
            
1029

    
    (iii) (A)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the
            
1030

    
date that the child was initially removed from the child's home.
            
1031

    
    (B)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12
            
1032

    
months of reunification services.
            
1033

    
    (iv)  If reunification services have been ordered, the court may terminate those services
            
1034

    
at any time.
            
1035

    
    (v)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to
            
1036

    
be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection
            
1037

    

78-3a-312

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance
            
1038

    
with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the
            
1039

    
permanent placement of the child.
            
1040

    
    (d)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
1041

    
described in Subsection (2)(c) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
1042

    
    (e) (i)  If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be
            
1043

    
conducted by the court in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

 at the expiration of the time
            
1044

    
period for reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12
            
1045

    
months after the original removal of the child.
            
1046

    
    (ii)  If reunification services have not been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be
            
1047

    
conducted within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

.
            
1048

    
    (f)  With regard to a child who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the child is
            
1049

    
initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
1050

    
    (i)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,

            
1051


    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-312

; and
            
1052

    
    (ii)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
1053

    
removal of the child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to
            
1054

    
comply with the treatment plan.
            
1055

    
    (g)  With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have
            
1056

    
been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period
            
1057

    
of six months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate
            
1058

    
reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental
            
1059

    
rights.
            
1060

    
    [(3) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
1061

    
permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
1062

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may determine that
            
1063

    
efforts to reunify a child with the child's family are not reasonable or appropriate, based on the
            
1064

    
individual circumstances, and that reunification services should not be provided.  In
            
1065

    
determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a child, and in making "reasonable
            
1066

    
efforts," the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern.]
            
1067

    
    [(b)] (3) (a)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided
            
1068

    
to a parent if the court finds[, by clear and convincing] evidence[,] that establishes beyond a
            
1069

    
reasonable doubt that any of the following circumstances exist:
            
1070

    
    (i)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
1071

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
1072

    
    (ii)  the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders [him]
            
1073

    
the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services; [that finding shall be based on
            
1074

    
competent evidence from mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision
            
1075

    
of services, the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within 12
            
1076

    
months;]
            
1077

    
    (iii) (A)  the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical
            
1078

    
or sexual abuse[, that];
            
1079

    
    (B)  following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of [his] the
            
1080

    
child's parent[,] and was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent[,]; and
            
1081

    
    (C)  the minor is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse;

            
1082


    
    (iv)  the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has
            
1083

    
committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder or
            
1084

    
manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide;
            
1085

    
    (v)  the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
1086

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
1087

    
minor;
            
1088

    
    (vi) (A)  the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by
            
1089

    
the parent[,]; and
            
1090

    
    (B)  the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services
            
1091

    
with the offending parent;
            
1092

    
    (vii)  the parent's rights have been terminated with regard to any other child;
            
1093

    
    (viii) (A)  the child has been removed from [his] the child's home on at least two
            
1094

    
previous occasions; and
            
1095

    
    (B)  reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times; [or]
            
1096

    
    (ix)  the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer; or
            
1097

    
    (x)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
1098

    
efforts or services.
            
1099

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (3)(a)(ii), the court's finding that a parent is suffering
            
1100

    
from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing
            
1101

    
reunification services shall be based on competent evidence from mental health professionals
            
1102

    
establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent is unlikely to be capable of
            
1103

    
adequately caring for the child within 12 months.
            
1104

    
    (4) (a)  The following shall be considered in determining whether reunification services
            
1105

    
are appropriate:
            
1106

    
    [(4) (a)  Failure] (i)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with
            
1107

    
any previous treatment plan[,];
            
1108

    
    (ii)  the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs
            
1109

    
or alcohol[,];
            
1110

    
    (iii)  a past history of violent behavior[,];
            
1111

    
    (iv)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the child[,];
            
1112

    
    (v)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the child to repeated abuse[,

            
1113


    
or]; and
            
1114

    
    (vi)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
1115

    
successful[, shall be considered in determining whether reunification services are appropriate].
            
1116

    
    (b)  The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in
            
1117

    
reunification with the child, in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.
            
1118

    
    (5)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), and the
            
1119

    
whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the
            
1120

    
minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits
            
1121

    
described in Subsection (2), however, are not tolled by the parent's absence.
            
1122

    
    (6) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
1123

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.  In
            
1124

    
determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent-child
            
1125

    
bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or
            
1126

    
illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for minors ten years
            
1127

    
of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services,
            
1128

    
and any other appropriate factors. 
            
1129

    
    (b)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the 12-month
            
1130

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2).
            
1131

    
    (c)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the 12-month
            
1132

    
limitation imposed in Subsection (2), unless the court determines that continued reunification
            
1133

    
services would be in the child's best interest.
            
1134

    
    (7)  If, pursuant to Subsection [(3)(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), or (x)]
            
1135

    
(3)(a), the court does not order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
1136

    
within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

.
            
1137

    
    Section 14.  
Section  
78-3a-314

 is amended to read:
            
1138

    
     78-3a-314.  All proceedings -- Persons entitled to be present.
            
1139

    
    (1)  A child who is the subject of a juvenile court hearing, any person entitled to notice
            
1140

    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-306

 or 

78-3a-309

, preadoptive parents, and any relative providing
            
1141

    
care for the child, are entitled to notice, to be present at each hearing held under this part,
            
1142

    
including administrative and citizen reviews, and are entitled to an opportunity to be heard.
            
1143

    
    (2)  Because the child's foster parents have the right to notice, pursuant to Section

            
1144


    

78-3a-309

, they have the right to be present at each and every hearing held under this part
            
1145

    
including administrative and citizen reviews, and are entitled to an opportunity to be heard.
            
1146

    
    (3)  [A] (a)  If the court has appointed a guardian ad litem for a child, the child shall be
            
1147

    
represented at each hearing by the guardian ad litem [appointed to his case by the court].
            
1148

    
    (b)  The child has a right to be present at each hearing, subject to the discretion of the
            
1149

    
guardian ad litem or the court regarding any possible detriment to the child.
            
1150

    
    (4) (a)  The parent or guardian of a child who is the subject of a petition under this part
            
1151

    
has the right to be represented by counsel, and to present evidence, at each hearing.
            
1152

    
    (b)  When it appears to the court that a parent or guardian of the child desires counsel

1241

    
    (1)  In determining whether a parent or parents have abandoned a child, it is prima facie
            
1242

    
evidence of abandonment that the parent or parents:
            
1243

    
    (a)  although having legal custody of the child, have surrendered physical custody of the
            
1244

    
child, and for a period of six months following the surrender have not manifested to the child
            
1245

    
or to the person having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical

the court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances, conduct, or
            
1253

    
conditions:
            
1254

    
    [(a)] (i)  emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent that renders
            
1255

    
him unable to care for the immediate and continuing physical or emotional needs of the child
            
1256

    
for extended periods of time;
            
1257

    
    [(b)] (ii)  conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or
            
1258

    
abusive nature;
            
1259

    
    [(c)] (iii)  habitual or excessive use of intoxicating liquors, controlled substances, or
            
1260

    
dangerous drugs that render the parent unable to care for the child;
            
1261

    
    [(d)] (iv)  repeated or continuous failure to provide the child with adequate food,
            
1262

    
clothing, shelter, education, or other care necessary for [his] the child's physical, mental, and
            
1263

    
emotional health and development by a parent or parents who are capable of providing that
            
1264

    
care[.  However, a parent who, legitimately practicing his religious beliefs, does not provide
            
1265

    
specified medical treatment for a child is not for that reason alone a negligent or unfit parent];
            
1266

    
    [(e)] (v)  with regard to a child who is in the custody of the division, if the parent is
            
1267

    
incarcerated as a result of conviction of a felony, and the sentence is of such length that the

            
1268


    
child will be deprived of a normal home for more than one year; or
            
1269

    
    [(f)] (vi)  a history of violent behavior.
            
1270

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (2)(a)(iv), a parent who does not provide specified
            
1271

    
medical treatment for a child, because the parent is legitimately practicing the parent's religious
            
1272

    
beliefs, is not a negligent or unfit parent.
            
1273

    
    (3)  If a child has been placed in the custody of the division and the parent or parents
            
1274

    
fail to comply substantially with the terms and conditions of a plan within six months after the
            
1275

    
date on which the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that
            
1276

    
failure to comply is evidence of failure of parental adjustment.
            
1277

    
    (4)  The following circumstances constitute prima facie evidence of unfitness:
            
1278

    
    (a)  sexual abuse, injury, or death of a sibling of the child, or of any child, due to known
            
1279

    
or substantiated abuse or neglect by the parent or parents;
            
1280

    
    (b)  conviction of a crime, if the facts surrounding the crime are of such a nature as to
            
1281

    
indicate the unfitness of the parent to provide adequate care to the extent necessary for the
            
1282

    
child's physical, mental, or emotional health and development;
            
1283

    
    (c)  a single incident of life-threatening or gravely disabling injury to or disfigurement
            
1284

    
of the child; or
            
1285

    
    (d)  the parent has committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to
            
1286

    
commit murder or manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide.

    (ii)  The court may not assess those fees or costs against a legal guardian, when that
            
1402

    
guardian is the state, or against a parent who is found to be impecunious.  If a person claims to

1409

    
Governmental Immunity Act.
            
1410

    
    [(8)] (9) (a)  An attorney guardian ad litem shall represent the best interest of a minor.
            
1411

    
    (b)  If the minor's wishes differ from the attorney's determination of the minor's best
            
1412

    
interest, the attorney guardian ad litem shall communicate the minor's wishes to the court in
            
1413

    
addition to presenting the attorney's determination of the minor's best interest.  A difference
            
1414

    
between the minor's wishes and the attorney's determination of best interest may not be
            
1415

    
considered a conflict of interest for the attorney.
            
1416

    
    [(b)] (c)  The court may appoint one attorney guardian ad litem to represent the best
            
1417

    [(9)] (10)  An attorney guardian ad litem shall be provided access to all division [of
            
1419

    
Child and Family Services] records regarding the minor at issue and the minor's family.
            
1420

    
    [(10)] (11)  An attorney guardian ad litem shall maintain current and accurate records
            
1421

    
regarding the number of times the attorney has had contact with each minor and the actions the
            
1422

    
attorney has taken in representation of the minor's best interest.

            
1423


    
    [(11)] (12) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection [(11)] (12)(b), all records of an

attorney guardian ad litem are confidential and may not be released or made public upon
            
1425

    
subpoena, search warrant, discovery proceedings, by authorization or order of a court, or
            
1426

    
otherwise.  This Subsection (12)(a) supersedes Title 63, Chapter 2, Government Records
            
1427

    
Access and Management Act.
            
1428

    
    (b)  All records of an attorney guardian ad litem are subject to legislative subpoena,
            
1429

    
under Title 36, Chapter 14, Legislative Subpoena Powers, and shall be released to the
            
1430

    
Legislature.

1435

    
    (d)  Because of the unique role of an attorney guardian ad litem described in Subsection
            
1436

    
[(8)] (9), and the state's role and responsibility to provide a guardian ad litem program and, as
            
1437

    
parens patriae, to protect minors, Subsection [(11)] (12)(b) constitutes an exception to Rules of
            
1438

    
Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6, as provided by Rule 1.6(b)(4).  A claim of attorney-client
            
1439

    
privilege does not bar access to the records of an attorney guardian ad litem by the Legislature,
            
1440

    
through legislative subpoena.
            
1441

    
    (e)  Notwithstanding Subsection (12)(d), an attorney guardian ad litem is bound by all
            
1442

1445

    
otherwise communicate information that will be disclosed publicly outside of the juvenile court
            
1446

    
about a child abuse, neglect, or dependency case, even if the communication does not involve
            
1447

    
the disclosure of a record that is private, controlled, or protected under Title 63, Chapter 2,
            
1448

    
Government Records Access and Management Act.
            
1449

    
    (14)  Each meeting of a child with the child's attorney guardian ad litem shall be

recorded as an audio or audio and video recording.

    (d)  if the minor is old enough to communicate and unless it would be detrimental to the
            
1487

    
minor:
            
1488

    
    (i)  meet with and interview the minor;
