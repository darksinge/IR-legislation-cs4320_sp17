 Highlighted Provisions:
            
15

    
    This bill:
            
16

    
    .    provides that an individual's home address, home telephone number, or personal
            
17

    
mobile phone number is a protected record, if:
            
18

    
        .    the information is required to be provided in order to comply with a law; and
            
19

    
        .    by complying with the law and due to the nature of the law the subject of the
            
20

    
record has a reasonable expectation that this information will be protected;
            
21

    
    .    allows the disclosure of an individual's home address or phone numbers that are
            
22

    
otherwise protected if:
            
23

    
        .    the head of the governmental entity determines that the disclosure is mutually
            
24

    
beneficial to the subject of the record, the governmental entity, and to the public
            
25

    
by serving a public purpose related to public safety or consumer protection; and
            
26

    
        .    the person who receives the record from the governmental entity agrees not to
            
27

    
use or allow its use for advertising or solicitation purposes;

            
28


    
    .    provides that in response to a request, a  governmental entity is not required to:

        .    provide a record in a particular format, medium, or program; or
            
31

32

    
publication or product of a governmental entity;
            
33

    
    .    allows rather than requires a governmental entity to provide a record in a particular
            
34

    
form if the governmental entity determines it is able to do so without unreasonably
            
35

    
interfering with its duties;
            
36

    
    .    allows a governmental entity to charge additional fees above the actual costs as
            
37

    
determined by the governmental entity's executive officer, for requests from
            
38

    
nongovernmental entities for a series of records if the records are provided in an
            
39

    
electronic spreadsheet format, in an electronic database format, or for the purpose of
            
40

    
resale of the records;
            
41

    
    .    requires additional fees to be reasonable and prohibits additional fees to be designed
            
42

    
to compete with a private business that provides substantially similar services;
            
43

    
    .    allows contractors and private providers to receive private, controlled, or protected
            
44

    
records under certain circumstances;
