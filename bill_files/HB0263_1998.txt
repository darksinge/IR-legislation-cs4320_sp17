1     REMOVAL OF DIRECTORY SUBSIDY


2     AMENDMENTS




3    1998 GENERAL SESSION


4    STATE OF UTAH


5     Sponsor: J. Brent Haymond


6    AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC UTILITIES; MODIFYING PROVISIONS RELATED TO

7    PRICE REGULATION; PROVIDING FOR THE REMOVAL OF SUBSIDIES RELATED TO

8    PRINTED DIRECTORIES FROM THE RATE STRUCTURE OF THE INCUMBENT

9    TELEPHONE CORPORATION; DIRECTING THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION TO

10    MAKE THE RATE ADJUSTMENT THROUGH A RATE HEARING; ESTABLISHING AN

11    EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE RATE ADJUSTMENT; AND MAKING TECHNICAL

12    CORRECTIONS.

13    This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated 1953 as follows:

14    AMENDS:

15         54-8b-2.4, as last amended by Chapter 226, Laws of Utah 1997

16    Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

17        Section 1.  Section  54-8b-2.4 is amended to read:

18         54-8b-2.4.  Price regulation -- Maximum prices.

19        (1)  The Legislature finds that:

20        (a)  traditional rate of return regulation cannot guarantee that customers who do not have

21    the choice of alternative providers will be protected from the economic responsibility for making

22    up for an incumbent telephone corporation's competitive losses or from providing for the recovery

23    of past, regulated investments;

24        (b)  the method of regulation set forth in this section will provide better protection to

25    customers who lack competitive choices than does traditional rate of return regulation; and

26        (c)  before moving from traditional rate of return regulation, it is essential the commission

27    address issues relating to the movement of prices towards cost and removing subsidies in the


1    existing price structure of incumbent telephone corporations to encourage competition for all

2    telecommunications services.

3        (2) (a)  Effective May 1, 1997, any incumbent telephone corporation with more than 30,000

4    access lines in the state shall be regulated pursuant to this section and may not be regulated on the

5    basis of rate of return or any similar method of regulation that is based on the earnings of the

6    incumbent telephone corporation, except as provided in this section.

7        (b)  Any incumbent telephone corporation serving fewer than 30,000 access lines in the

8    state may petition the commission to be regulated under price regulation rather than traditional rate

9    of return regulation.  In adopting price regulation for incumbent telephone corporations with fewer

10    than 30,000 access lines, the commission may modify the provisions of this section taking into

11    consideration the individual circumstances of the incumbent telephone corporation seeking price

12    regulation.

13        (3) (a)  Any general rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than

14    30,000 access lines in the state initiated before May 1, 1997, shall be based on a 1996 test period

15    and shall be conducted under the principles of traditional rate of return regulation, even though the

16    final order in the case is not issued until May 1, 1997, or thereafter.

17        (b)  A rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than 30,000

18    access lines in the state may be initiated after April 30, 1997, and before March 1, 1998.

19        (i)  The rate proceeding shall be revenue neutral relative to the last proceeding filed

20    pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), except that the commission may increase or decrease the revenue

21    anticipated from all rates to account for changes in the following factors which are known and

22    measurable at the time of hearings in the case:

23        (A)  any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone

24    corporation required by federal or state law or [approval] approved by the commission;

25        (B)  changes in rules of the Federal Communications Commission, including rules with

26    regard to the separation of interstate and intrastate revenues, expenses, or investments;

27        (C)  changes in tax rates applied to the incumbent telephone corporation;

28        (D)  any other change external to the business operations of the incumbent telephone

29    corporation resulting from:

30        (I)  accounting rules adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and approved

31    by the commission; or

- 2 -


1        (II)  laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction; or

2        (E)  any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April 30, 1997.

3        (ii)  In the rate proceeding, the commission may also rebalance rates of particular services

4    to move rates of those services toward cost.

8    May 1, 1997.  The prices of services offered pursuant to a price list or competitive contract shall

9    be governed by Section 54-8b-2.3.

10        (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (4)(a), prices may increase pursuant to any prices

11    established in a final order of the commission for a rate proceeding initiated before March 1, 1998,

12    or the adjustment of those prices as a result of an appeal or remand of the final order, or as a result

13    of the adjustment provided in Subsection (7).

16    of the incumbent telephone corporation according to an aggregate price index or price indices

17    associated with groups of services.  The aggregate price index or price indices shall be adjusted

18    annually to reflect the effects of inflation, productivity, and exogenous factors and to maintain an

19    appropriate level of service quality.  The precise manner of annual adjustment shall be developed

20    by the commission after notice and a hearing and before the end of the three-year period.

21        (b)  Factors in the price index or price indices may also include the following:
