     31A-22-305.3.  Underinsured motorist coverage.
            
464

    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
465

    
    (a)  "Covered person" has the same meaning as defined in Section

occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the injured party
            
469

    
for all special and general damages.
            
470

    
    (ii)  The term "underinsured motor vehicle" does not include:

    (B)  an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection 

31A-22-305

(2); or

    (2) (a) [(i)]  Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection 

31A-22-302

(1)(c)
            
479

    [(ii)] (b)  A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or
            
483

    
furnished to the covered person, the covered person's spouse, or covered person's resident
            
484

489

    
underinsured motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's
            
490

    
motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits
            
491

    
available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy, unless [the] a named
            
492

    
insured rejects or purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form

            
493


    
that:
            
494

    
    (i)  is filed with the department;

liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the
            
501

    
insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.
            
502

    
    (b)  For purposes of this Subsection (3), "new policy" means:
            
503

    
    (i)  any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an
            
504

    
existing policy; or

    (A)  a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy; or
            
507

    
    (B)  a change in the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage.
            
508

    
    (c) (i)  As used in this Subsection (3)(c), "additional motor vehicle" means a change

511

    
    (ii)  The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or
            
512

    
commercial lines policy does not constitute a "new policy" for purposes of Subsection (3)(b).
            
513

    
    (iii)  If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where
            
514

    
underinsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where underinsured motorist limits are
            
515

    
lower than the named insured's motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice
            
516

    
to a named insured within thirty days that:
            
517

    
    (A)  reasonably explains the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage; and
            
518

    
    (B)  encourages the named insured to contact the insurance company or insurance
            
519

    
producer for quotes as to the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist
            
520

522

523

    
    (d)  A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under

            
524


    
Subsection (3)(b)(ii) does not constitute a new policy.
            
525

    
    (e) (i)  Subsection (3)(b) applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after January 1,
            
526

527

    
filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.
            
528

    
    (ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection (3):
            
529

    
    (A)  does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights; and
            
530

    
    (B)  clarifies legislative intent.
            
531

    
    [(c)] (f)  A self-insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide
            
532

    
underinsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self-insured

memorandum or policy statement from the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that
            
535

    
declares the:

of the underinsured motorist coverage until the named insured, in writing, requests different
            
543

    
underinsured motorist coverage from the insurer.
            
544

    
    [(f)] (i) (i)  The named insured's underinsured motorist coverage, as described in
