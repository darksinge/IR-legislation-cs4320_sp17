 General Description:
            
8

    
    This bill modifies provisions governing the addition of fluorine to local water systems
            
9

    
by requiring cost estimates and by authorizing citizens to revoke approval for the
            
10

    
addition of fluorine when actual estimated costs exceed the cost estimates by a certain
            
11

    
amount.

 Highlighted Provisions:
            
13

15

    
a water system before the election is held to determine whether or not to add
            
16

    
fluorine;
            
17

    
    .    requires the local government to allow citizens time to qualify an initiative petition
            
18

    
that revokes authority to add fluorine to the water system when the cost of adding
            
19

    
fluorine to the water system exceeds the original cost estimate by more than 10%;
            
20
