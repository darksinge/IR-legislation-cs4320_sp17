Legislative Review Note      as of                AM     This legislation raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns    The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act addresses disclosure of a consumer report to a consumer if  the user takes an adverse action against the consumer based on the report.  The federal act  generally preempts state law to the extent that state law is inconsistent with the federal act.   Because this bill requires a consumer reporting agency to allow disclosure in circumstances not  addressed by the federal act, a court would have to determine whether this bill is inconsistent with  the federal act and therefore preempted.  In some circumstances courts have upheld state laws that  provide greater protection to consumers than the federal act which this bill arguably does.
