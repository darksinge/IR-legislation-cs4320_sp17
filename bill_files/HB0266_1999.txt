A copy of this notice shall be kept in the office of the broker for at                           least five years.  To be financially sound, an insurer shall satisfy standards that are comparable to                           those applied under the laws of this state to authorized insurers.  Insurers on the  doubtful or                            objectionable  list under Subsection     d  and insurers not on the commissioner s  reliable  list                            under Subsection     d  are presumed substandard.                                     A policy issued under this section shall include a description of the subject of the                            insurance and indicate the coverage, conditions, and term of the insurance, the premium charged                            and premium taxes to be collected from the policyholder, and the name and address of the                            policyholder and insurer.

All policies issued under the authority of this section shall have attached or affixed to                            the policy the following statement   The insurer issuing this policy does not hold a certificate of                            authority to do business in this state and thus is not fully subject to regulation by the Utah                            insurance commissioner.  This policy receives no protection from any of the guaranty associations                            created under Title   A, Chapter   .                                      Upon placing a new or renewal coverage under this section, the broker shall promptly                            deliver to the policyholder or his agent evidence of the insurance consisting either of the policy as                            issued by the insurer or, if the policy is not then available, a certificate, cover note, or other                            confirmation of insurance complying with Subsection    .                                      If  he  the commissioner finds it necessary to protect the interests of insureds and the                            public in this state, the commissioner may by rule subject policies issued under this section to as                            much of the regulation provided by this title as is required for comparable policies written by                            authorized foreign insurers.                                      a   Each surplus lines transaction in this state shall be examined to determine whether                               it complies with                                  i   the surplus lines tax levied under Chapter                                    ii   the solicitation limitations of Subsection                                      iii   the requirement of Subsection     that placement be through a surplus lines broker                                  iv   placement limitations imposed under Subsections     a ,  b , and  c   and                                 v   the policy form requirements of Subsections     and     .                                 b   The examination described in Subsection      a  shall take place as soon as practicable                            after the transaction.  The surplus lines broker shall submit to the examiner information necessary                            to conduct the examination within a period specified by rule.                                 c   The examination described in Subsection      a  may be conducted by the                            commissioner or by an advisory organization created under Section       A            and authorized                            by the commissioner to conduct these examinations.  The commissioner is not required to                            authorize any additional advisory organizations to conduct examinations under this subsection.                             The commissioner s authorization of one or more advisory organizations to act as examiners under                            this subsection shall be by rule.  In addition, the authorization shall be evidenced by a contract, on                            a form provided by the commissioner, between the authorized advisory organization and the                            department.                                 d   The person conducting the examination described in Subsection      a  shall collect                            a stamping fee of an amount not to exceed    of the policy premium payable in connection with                            the transaction.  Stamping fees collected by the commissioner shall be deposited in the General                            Fund.  The commissioner shall establish this fee by rule.  Stamping fees collected by an advisory                            organization are the property of the advisory organization to be used in paying the expenses of the                            advisory organization.  Liability for paying the stamping fee is as required under Subsection                               A              for taxes imposed under Section       A          .  The commissioner shall adopt a rule                            dealing with the payment of stamping fees.  If stamping fees are not paid when due, the                            commissioner or advisory organization may impose a penalty of     of the fee due, plus                                   per month from the time of default until full payment of the fee.  Fees relative to policies covering                            risks located partially in this state shall be allocated in the same manner as under Subsection                               A             .                                 e   The commissioner, representatives of the department, advisory organizations,                            representatives and members of advisory organizations, authorized insurers, and surplus lines                               insurers are not liable for damages on account of statements, comments, or recommendations made                            in good faith in connection with their duties under this subsection or under Section       A           .                                 f   Examinations conducted under this subsection and the documents and materials related                            to the examinations are confidential.
