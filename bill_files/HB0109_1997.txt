If within the time period described in Subsection     the division is unable to locate         a suitable adoptive home, it shall contract with licensed child placing agencies to search for an         appropriate adoptive home for the child, and to place the child for adoption.  The division shall         comply with the requirements of Section   A  a     and contract with a variety of child placing         agencies licensed  pursuant to  under Part  .                   The time period described in Subsection     does not apply with regard to children who          the division has determined to have special needs or circumstances  making  that have proven to          make the child hard to place for adoption.

Rules for child placing agencies shall be issued, amended, or repealed in accordance         with Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.                   Any interested person may petition to the division for the issuance, amendment, or          repeal of a rule.               Section  .  Section    A  a     is amended to read                  A  a    .  Promotion of adoption    Agency notification of potential adoptive           parents    DCFS utilization and training of those parents.                   The division and all agencies licensed under this part shall promote adoption when that          is a possible and appropriate alternative for a child.  Specifically, in accordance with Section            A  a    . , the division shall actively promote the adoption of all children in its custody who          have a permanency goal of adoption and who are eligible for adoption.  The division shall obtain          or conduct research of prior adoptive families to determine what families may do to be successful          with their adoptive children and shall make this research available to potential adoptive parents.                   a   On or before July  ,     , each agency licensed under this part shall provide all          potential adoptive parents who have applied for adoption with that agency with information          regarding all children in the custody of the division who have a permanency goal of adoption and          who are eligible for adoption.

With regard to those parents who grant permission, the agency shall provide the          division with those names within ten calendar days of receiving permission.  Upon receipt of those          names, the division shall consider the suitability of those persons as potential adoptive parents for                 children in the custody of the division, provide the agency with the names and complete case         histories of appropriate children, and provide the training and support described in Subsection           A  a    .    .             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Shelter hearing    Placement with a noncustodial parent or relative.                  a   When, at the time of the shelter hearing, the court orders that a child be removed         from the custody of his parent in accordance with the requirements of Section     a    , the court         shall first determine whether there is another natural parent, with whom the child was not residing         at the time the events or conditions that brought him within the court s jurisdiction occurred, who          desires to assume custody of the child.  If that parent requests custody, the court shall place the          minor with that parent unless it finds that the placement would be unsafe or otherwise detrimental          to the child.               b   i   The court shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that parent to assume          custody, and the safety and appropriateness of the placement.               ii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct an          investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.               iii   If the court orders an investigation by the division, the division shall, at a minimum,          visit the home, perform criminal background checks in accordance with Sections     a    .  and            A  a    . , and check the division s management information system for any previous reports          of abuse or neglect received by the division regarding the parent at issue.               iv   The division shall report its findings in writing to the court.               v   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending its          determination regarding that placement.                   If the court orders placement with a parent under Subsection    , it may order that the          parent assume custody subject to the supervision of the court, and order that services be provided          to the parent from whose custody the child was removed, the parent who has assumed custody, or          both.  The court may also provide for reasonable visitation with the parent from whose custody          the child was removed, if that is in the best interest of the child.  The court s order shall be          periodically reviewed to determine whether                a   placement with the parent continues to be in the child s best interest                b   the child should be returned to the original custodial parent                       c    the child should be placed with a relative, pursuant to Subsection            or              d   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                  The time periods described in Section     a     with regard to reunification apply to         children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with Subsection    .                  Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection     or            .  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition that         court for modification of the order.                  a   If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of his         parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at that time, determine          whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child.  The court may order the          Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a reasonable search to determine whether there          are relatives of the child who are willing and appropriate, in accordance with the requirements of          this section, for placement of the child.  The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the          division pending that determination.  This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an          identified relative will receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration may be          given to a relative s request for placement of the child, if it is in the best interest of the child, and          the provisions of this section are satisfied.               b   If a willing relative is identified pursuant to Subsection  a , the court shall make a          specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative to assume custody, and the safety and          appropriateness of placement with that relative.  The court may order the Division of Child and          Family Services to conduct an investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the          placement.  The division shall conduct criminal background checks in accordance with Sections              a    .  and   A  a    . , report its findings in writing to the court, and provide sufficient          information so that the court may determine whether                i   the relative has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other children that          may indicate or present a danger to this child                ii   the child is comfortable with the relative                iii   the relative recognizes the parent s history of abuse and is determined to protect the          child                iv   the relative is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent for access          to the child, in accordance with court orders                       v   the relative is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary  and              vi   the relative can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.              c   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the         division s investigation pursuant to Subsection  b , and the court s determination regarding that         placement.  The court shall ultimately base its determination regarding placement with a relative         on the best interest of the child.              d   For purposes of this section,  relative  means an adult who is a grandparent, aunt,         uncle, or sibling of the child.                  When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative pursuant to Subsection                   , it shall order that the relative assume custody subject to the continuing supervision of the          court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided to the minor and the relative.  That          placement shall be periodically reviewed by the court to determine whether                a   placement with the relative continues to be in the child s best interest                b   the child should be returned home  or               c   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                   a   When the court vests custody of a child with another parent or relative pursuant to          this section, the child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the Division of Child and          Family Services.  The child, any parent affected by this section, and any relative with whom the          child is placed are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may enter any order          that it deems necessary for the protection and best interest of the child.  The time periods described          in Section     a    , with regard to reunification, apply to children placed with a relative pursuant          to Subsection          .               b   When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of his parent and does          not vest custody in another parent or relative under this section, the court shall order that the child          be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, to proceed to          adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services in accordance with this          chapter and Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.                   a   Any preferential consideration that a relative may be initially granted pursuant to          Subsection          expires    days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that time period has          expired, a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a child, may not be          granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.                      b   When a period of    days from the shelter hearing has expired, the preferential         consideration which may initially be granted to a parent in accordance with Subsection    , is         limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best interest of the child.          The court shall take into consideration               i   the extent of the parent s relationship with the child               ii   whether the parent had actual knowledge of the child s removal from the other parent s         custody               iii   whether, in the past, the parent has participated in raising the child by taking         responsibility for the child, maintaining a relationship with the child, and financially supporting          the child in accordance with his abilities  and               iv   the nature and extent of the child s relationships and well being in his current          placement.              Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .  Dispositional hearing    Child in custody of Division of Child and Family           Services    Order for reunification services    Exceptions.                   The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section     a    , place the          child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency, order          protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or other services.                   a   Except as provided in Subsection    , whenever the court orders continued removal          at the dispositional hearing, and that the minor remain in the custody of the Division of Child and          Family Services, it shall order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the          minor and his parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, within a maximum          time period not to exceed    months from the date that the child was initially removed from his          home by the division.               b   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent during the period described in          Subsection  a  does not interrupt the running of the period.               c   At the expiration of the    month period described in Subsection  a , a dispositional          review hearing shall be conducted by the court in accordance with Section     a    .  If at that          time the child cannot be safely returned to the care and custody of his parent without court          supervision, a permanency plan for the child shall be finalized.  If the child clearly desires contact          with the parent, the court shall take the child s desire into consideration in determining the                 permanency plan.              d   With regard to a child who is two years of age or younger at the time the court orders         reunification services, the court  may  shall order the discontinuance of those services after six         months if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to comply with the treatment plan.          The burden is upon the parents, and the division if it supports continued reunification services, to         show that the parents have made substantial efforts to comply with the plan during the first six         months of reunification services.              e   With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have been         ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period of six          months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate          reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide permanency          for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a parent s interest          in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may, under any circumstances, determine          that efforts to reunify a child with his family are not reasonable, based on the individual          circumstances, and that reunification services need not be provided.  In any case, there is a          presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a parent if the court finds, by          clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following circumstances exist                a   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit indicating          that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                b   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders him          incapable of utilizing those services  that finding shall be based on competent evidence from          mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent is          unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within    months                c   the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or sexual          abuse, that following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of his parent, was          subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the minor is being removed due to          additional physical or sexual abuse                d   the parent has been convicted of causing the death of another child through abuse or          neglect                e   the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the                 parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the minor               f   the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,         and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with the         offending parent               g   the parent s rights have been terminated with regard to any other child               h   the child has been removed from his home on at least two previous occasions and         reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times   or               i   the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer  or               i    j   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification          efforts or services.                   a   Failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with any previous          treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs          or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, whether a parent continues to live with an individual          who abused the child, any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the child to repeated          abuse, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be          successful, are relevant factors to consider in determining whether reunification services should          be ordered.               b   The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in          reunification with the child, in determining whether to order that reunification services be          provided.                   If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a , and the          whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the          minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits          described in Subsection    , however, are not tolled by the parent s absence.                   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services          unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.  In determining          detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent child bonding, the          length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of          detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for minors ten years of age or older, the          minor s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other          appropriate factors.  Reunification services for an incarcerated or institutionalized parent are                 subject to the    month limitation imposed in Subsection     unless the court determines that         continued reunification services would be in the child s best interest.                  If, pursuant to Subsection     b ,  c ,  d ,  e ,  f ,  g ,  h ,  or   i , or  j  the court does         not order reunification services, a hearing shall be conducted within     days for establishment         of a permanency plan for the child, in accordance with Subsection     a       .             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Petition    Who may file.                  a   Any interested party may file a petition for termination of the parent child         relationship with regard to a child.               b   A child s foster parent may file a petition for termination of parental rights so long as          that foster parent intends to pursue adoption  and has had physical custody of the child for one year          or longer .  A foster parent does not lose standing to file a petition under this section solely          because the division removes the child from that home.                   The  attorney general shall file a petition for termination of parental rights under this          part on behalf of the division.               Section  .

Children in the custody of the Division of Child   Family Services              Consideration of child s relationship with foster parents who petition for adoption.              In assessing the best interest of a child in the custody of the Division of Child and Family          Services whose foster parents have petitioned for adoption, the court shall give special          consideration to the relationship of the child with his foster parents, if the child has been in that          home for a period of six months or longer.               Legislative Review Note      as of                AM    This bill raises the following constitutional or statutory  concerns          The amendment to Subsection     a        d  makes termination of reunification services  mandatory after six months, with regard to a child who is two years of age or younger. That  provision, as applied to the circumstances of an individual case, could be found by a court to  violate a parent s constitutionally protected rights in raising his or her child.  It would depend  on the nature of the abuse or neglect, the nature of the reunification services, and other  individual circumstances.  However, the statute s six month deadline does not apply if the  parent has made substantial efforts to comply with the treatment plan.  Because the state does  have a compelling interest in protecting children and in providing permanency to children in  the state foster care system, there is a strong legal argument in favor of treating the cases of  very young children with a greater degree of state intervention.
