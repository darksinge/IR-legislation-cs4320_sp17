13        (iii)  the ability of the payor spouse to provide support; and

14        (iv)  the length of the marriage.

15        (b)  The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining alimony.

16        (c)  As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at the time

17    of separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection (7)(a).  However, the court

18    shall consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion, base alimony

19    on the standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short duration, when no

20    children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider the standard of

21    living that existed at the time of the marriage.

22        (d)  The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the parties'

23    respective standards of living.

24        (e)  When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major change in the

25    income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change shall be considered

26    in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony.  If one spouse's earning

27    capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses during the marriage, the

28    court may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital property and awarding

29    alimony.

30        (f)  In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no children

31    have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring each party to

- 3 -


1    the condition which existed at the time of the marriage.

2        (g) (i)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new orders

3    regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not foreseeable at the

4    time of the divorce.

5        (ii)  The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address needs

6    of the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court finds

7    extenuating circumstances that justify that action.

8        (iii)  In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not

9    be considered, except as provided in this subsection.

10        (A)  The court may consider the subsequent spouse's financial ability to share living

11    expenses.

12        (B)  The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that the

13    payor's improper conduct justifies that consideration.

14        (h)  Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years that the

15    marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony, the court finds extenuating

16    circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.

17        (8)  Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court that

18    a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage of that

19    former spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void ab initio, payment of

20    alimony shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the action of annulment and

21    his rights are determined.

22        (9)  Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates upon

23    establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with another

24    person.

25        Section 2.  Section  30-3-10 is amended to read:

26         30-3-10.  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce -- Custody

27     consideration.

28        (1)  If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is declared

29    void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the minor

30    children as it considers appropriate.  In determining custody, the court shall consider the best

31    interests of the child and the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties. 

- 4 -


1    The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children's desires regarding

2    the future custody, but the expressed desires are not controlling and the court may determine the

3    children's custody otherwise.

4        (2)  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds

5    relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing the

6    child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate.

7        (3)  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has attempted

8    to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into consideration in

9    determining whether to award custody to the other parent.

10        (4) (a)  A court may not discriminate against a parent due to a disability, as defined in

11    Section 57-21-2, in awarding custody or determining whether a substantial change has occurred

12    for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.

13        (b)  If a court takes a parent's disability into account in awarding custody or determining

14    whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody, the

15    parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising therefrom by

16    showing that:

17        (i)  the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent's ability to provide

18    for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue; or

19        (ii)  the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources available

20    to supplement the parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at

21    issue.

22        (c)  Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to:

23        (i)  abuse, neglect, or dependency proceedings under Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and

24    Family Services, or Title 78, Chapter 3a, Juvenile Courts; or

25        (ii)  adoption proceedings under Title 78, Chapter 30, Adoption.
