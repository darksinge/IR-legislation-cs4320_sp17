Section 62A-4a-201 is amended to read:34          62A-4a-201. Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of35     state.36          (1) (a)  Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a37     parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the38     parent's children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves39     to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions40     or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's41     children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened42     protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty43     interests.44          (b)  The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and45     management of the parent's children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist46     simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent's child is placed in47     the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing48     the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government49     action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or50     alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental51     unfitness, and the child suffers, or is substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result,52     the child and the child's parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of53     their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child's parents are54     adversaries.55          (c)  It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and56     supervision of the child's natural parents.  A child's need for a normal family life in a57     permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the58     child's natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to59     conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected.  The right of a fit, competent60     parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental61     liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental62     public policy of this state.63          (d)  The state recognizes that:64          (i)  a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,65     train, educate, provide and care for, and reasonably discipline the parent's children; and66          (ii)  the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.67          (e)  It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty68     to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their69     children.70          (f)  Subsections (2) through (7) shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this71     Subsection (1).72          (2)  It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection73     from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,74     prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title 78A,75     Chapter 6, Juvenile Court Act of 1996.  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest in76     and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide77     for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a78     substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and79     proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take action for80     the welfare and protection of the parent's children.81          (3)  When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,82     it shall take into account the child's need for protection from immediate harm and the extent to83     which the child's extended family may provide needed protection.  Throughout its involvement,84     the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to protect a85     child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families, rather86     than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.87          (4)  When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child's immediate safety88     or welfare, the division may seek custody of the child for a planned, temporary period and89     place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this section and in90     accordance with the requirements of Title 78A, Chapter 6, Part 3, Abuse, Neglect, and91     Dependency Proceedings, and:92          (a)  when safe and appropriate, return the child to the child's parent; or93          (b)  as a last resort, pursue another permanency plan.94          (5)  In determining and making "reasonable efforts" with regard to a child, pursuant to95     the provisions of Section 62A-4a-203, both the division's and the court's paramount concern96     shall be the child's health, safety, and welfare.  The desires of a parent for the parent's child,97     and the constitutionally protected rights of a parent, as described in this section, shall be given98     full and serious consideration by the division and the court.99          (6)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe100     abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or101     to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child's home, provide reunification102     services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection (6) does103     not exempt the division from providing court-ordered services.104          (7) (a)  The division shall strive to achieve appropriate permanency for children who are105     abused, neglected, or dependent.  The division shall provide in-home services, where106     appropriate and safe, in an effort to help a parent to correct the behavior that resulted in abuse,107     neglect, or dependency of the parent's child.  [If] The division may pursue a foster placement108     only if in-home services fail or are otherwise insufficient or inappropriate[, the].  The division109     shall also seek qualified extended family support or a kinship placement to maintain a sense of110     security and stability for the child.  If in-home services and kinship placement are not safe or111     appropriate, or in-home services and kinship placement fail and cannot be corrected[, the112     division may pursue a foster placement].113          (b)  If the use or continuation of "reasonable efforts," as described in Subsections (5)114     and (6), is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for a child, then measures115     shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan,116     and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.117          (c)  Subject to the parental rights recognized and protected under this section, if, 118     because of a parent's conduct or condition, the parent is determined to be unfit or incompetent119     based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title 78A, Chapter 6, Part120     5, Termination of Parental Rights Act, the continuing welfare and best interest of the child is of121     paramount importance, and shall be protected in determining whether that parent's rights122     should be terminated.123          (8)  The state's right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health124     care for a child is subject to [Subsection] Subsections 78A-6-105(27)(d) and 78A-6-117(2)(n)125     and Section 78A-6-301.5.126          Section 2.

Section 78A-6-312 is amended to read:864          78A-6-312. Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.865          (1)  The court may:866          (a)  make any of the dispositions described in Section 78A-6-117;867          (b)  place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any:868          (i)  individual; or869          (ii)  public or private entity or agency; or870          (c)  order:871          (i)  protective supervision;872          (ii)  family preservation;873          (iii)  subject to Subsections (12)(b) [and], 78A-6-105(27)(d), and 78A-6-117(2)(n)[(iii)]874     and Section 78A-6-301.5, medical or mental health treatment; or875          (iv)  other services.876          (2)  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that877     the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:878          (a)  establish a primary permanency goal for the minor; and879          (b)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency goal, reunification services880     are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsections (20) through (22).881          (3)  Subject to Subsections (6) and (7), if the court determines that reunification882     services are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for883     reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,884     unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.885          (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe886     abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make887     "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to888     attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.889          (5)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount890     concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.891          (6)  For purposes of Subsection (3), parent-time is in the best interests of a minor unless892     the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:893          (a)  protect the physical safety of the minor;894          (b)  protect the life of the minor; or895          (c)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the896     minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.897          (7)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), a court may not deny parent-time based solely on a898     parent's failure to:899          (a)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or900          (b)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.901          (8) (a)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a902     concurrent permanency goal that shall include:903          (i)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal will904     be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal; and905          (ii)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency906     goal.907          (b)  In determining the primary permanency goal and concurrent permanency goal, the908     court shall consider:909          (i)  the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement;910          (ii)  the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent-child relationship is legally911     terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available; and912          (iii)  the use of an individualized permanency goal, only as a last resort.913          (9)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection914     78A-6-314(1)(b) within 30 days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if915     something other than reunification is initially established as a minor's primary permanency916     goal.917          (10) (a)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency goal before the918     establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 78A-6-314.919          (b)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event920     that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.921          (c)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor's primary922     permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section923     78A-6-314 on or before the earlier of:924          (i)  30 days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this925     Subsection (10)(c); or926          (ii)  the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section927     78A-6-314, ends.928          (11) (a)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order929     that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor's930     parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.931          (b)  In providing the services described in Subsection (11)(a), the minor's health, safety,932     and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.933          (12) (a)  The court shall:934          (i)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child935     and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;936          (ii)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family937     plan in accordance with Subsection 62A-4a-205(6)(e); and938          (iii)  identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties,939     the responsibilities described in Subsection (12)(a)(ii), for the purpose of assisting in any future940     determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and941     federal law.942          (b)  If the parent is in a substance abuse treatment program, other than a certified drug943     court program:944          (i)  the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in945     addition to the testing recommended by the parent's substance abuse program based on a946     finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol; and947          (ii)  the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing948     recommended by the substance abuse program to the court or division.949          (13) (a)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the950     date that the minor was initially removed from the minor's home, unless the time period is951     extended under Subsection 78A-6-314(8).952          (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12953     months of reunification services.954          (14) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at955     any time.956          (b)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined957     to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section958     78A-6-314, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:959          (i)  place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan; and960          (ii)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the961     minor.962          (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period963     described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.964          (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted965     by the court in accordance with Section 78A-6-314 at the expiration of the time period for966     reunification services.967          (b)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original968     removal of the minor.969          (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted970     within 30 days, in accordance with Section 78A-6-314.971          (17)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are972     ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six973     months from the date that reunification services were ordered:974          (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and975          (b)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.976          (18)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section977     78A-6-314, the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the978     sibling group together is:979          (a)  practicable; and980          (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.981          (19) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide982     permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a983     parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.984          (b)  The court may determine that:985          (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,986     based on the individual circumstances; and987          (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.988          (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in989     making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount990     concern.991          (20)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a992     parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following993     circumstances exist:994          (a)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit995     indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;996          (b)  subject to Subsection (21)(a), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such997     magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;998          (c)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,999     sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:1000          (i)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;1001          (ii)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and1002          (iii)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual1003     exploitation;1004          (d)  the parent:1005          (i)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect;1006          (ii)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:1007          (A)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or1008          (B)  child abuse homicide;1009          (iii)  committed sexual abuse against the child;1010          (iv)  is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender; or1011          (v) (A)  intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the1012     child;1013          (B)  is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation1014     for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child; or1015          (C)  is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or1016     recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child;1017          (e)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the1018     parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the1019     minor;1020          (f)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,1021     and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the1022     offending parent;1023          (g)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;1024          (h)  the minor was removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions1025     and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;1026          (i)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;1027          (j)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a1028     location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation1029     was located;1030          (k)  except as provided in Subsection (21)(b), with respect to a parent who is the child's1031     birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or was1032     exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child's mother while the child1033     was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the mother1034     agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a1035     substance abuse treatment program approved by the department; or1036          (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification1037     efforts or services.1038          (21) (a)  The finding under Subsection (20)(b) shall be based on competent evidence1039     from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing1040     that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately1041     caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is made.1042          (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection (20)(k) if the court finds, under1043     the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection1044     (20)(k) is not warranted.1045          (22)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take1046     into consideration:1047          (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child1048     and family plan;1049          (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of1050     drugs or alcohol;1051          (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family1052     member;1053          (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;1054          (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;1055          (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be1056     successful; and1057          (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.1058          (23) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections (19) through1059     (21), and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which1060     the out-of-home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide1061     reunification services.1062          (b)  The time limits described in Subsections (2) through (18) are not tolled by the1063     parent's absence.1064          (24) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable1065     services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.1066          (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (24)(a), the court shall1067     consider:1068          (i)  the age of the minor;1069          (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;1070          (iii)  the length of the sentence;1071          (iv)  the nature of the treatment;1072          (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;1073          (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;1074          (vii)  for a minor 10 years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the1075     implementation of family reunification services;
