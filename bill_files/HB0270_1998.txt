3    by subtracting necessary expenses required for self-employment or business operation from gross

4    receipts.  The income and expenses from self-employment or operation of a business shall be

5    reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child

6    support award.  Only those expenses necessary to allow the business to operate at a reasonable

7    level may be deducted from gross receipts.

8        (b)  Gross income determined under this subsection may differ from the amount of business

9    income determined for tax purposes.

13    year-to-date pay stubs or employer statements and complete copies of tax returns from at least the

14    most recent year unless the court finds the verification is not reasonably available.  Verification

15    of income from records maintained by the Department of Workforce Services may be substituted

16    for pay stubs, employer statements, and income tax returns.

17        (c)  Historical and current earnings shall be used to determine whether an

18    underemployment or overemployment situation exists.

19        (6)  Gross income includes income imputed to the parent under Subsection (7).

20        (7) (a)  Income may not be imputed to a parent unless the parent stipulates to the amount

21    imputed or a hearing is held and a finding made that the parent is voluntarily unemployed or

22    underemployed.

23        (b)  If income is imputed to a parent, the income shall be based upon employment potential

24    and probable earnings as derived from work history, occupation qualifications, and prevailing

25    earnings for persons of similar backgrounds in the community.

26        (c)  If a parent has no recent work history, income shall be imputed at least at the federal

27    minimum wage for a 40-hour work week.  To impute a greater income, the judge in a judicial

28    proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding shall enter specific findings

29    of fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.

30        (d)  Income may not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist:

31        (i)  the reasonable costs of child care for the parents' minor children approach or equal the

6        (8) (a)  Gross income may not include the earnings of a minor child who is the subject of

7    a child support award nor benefits to a minor child in the child's own right such as Supplemental

8    Security Income.

9        (b)  Social Security benefits received by a child due to the earnings of a parent shall be

10    credited as child support to the parent upon whose earning record it is based, by crediting the

11    amount against the potential obligation of that parent.  Other unearned income of a child may be

12    considered as income to a parent depending upon the circumstances of each case.

13        Section 4.  Section  78-45-7.7 is amended to read:

14         78-45-7.7.  Calculation of obligations.  

15        (1)  The parents' child support obligation shall be divided between them in proportion to

16    their adjusted gross incomes, unless the low income table is applicable.

17        (2)  Except in cases of joint physical custody and split custody as defined in Section

18    78-45-2 and in cases where the obligor's adjusted gross income is $1,050 or less monthly, the base

19    child support award shall be determined as follows:

20        (a)  combine the adjusted gross incomes of the parents and determine the base combined

21    child support obligation using the base combined child support obligation table[.]; and

22        (b)  calculate each parent's proportionate share of the base combined child support

23    obligation by multiplying the combined child support obligation by each parent's percentage of

24    combined adjusted gross income.

25        (3)  In the case of an incapacitated adult child, any amount that the adult child can

26    contribute toward his or her support should be applied to defray the cost borne by the adult child's

27    parents and should be determined as follows:

28        (a)  reduce the total child support obligation by the amount the adult child is able to

29    contribute toward the adult child's own support; and

30        (b)  calculate each parent's proportionate share of the base combined child support

31    obligation, using the parents' respective incomes only, by multiplying the combined child support

- 6 -


1    obligation by each parent's percentage of combined adjusted income.

2        [(3)] (4)  In cases where the monthly adjusted gross income of the obligor is between $650

3    and $1,050, the base child support award shall be the lesser of the amount calculated in accordance

4    with Subsection (2) and the amount calculated using the low income table.

5        [(4)] (5)  The base combined child support obligation table provides combined child

6    support obligations for up to six children.  For more than six children, additional amounts may be

7    added to the base child support obligation shown.  Unless rebutted by Subsection 78-45-7.2(3),

8    the amount ordered shall not be less than the amount which would be ordered for up to six

9    children.

10        [(5)] (6)  If the monthly adjusted gross income of the obligor is $649 or less, the court or

11    administrative agency shall determine the amount of the child support obligation on a case-by-case

12    basis, but the base child support award shall not be less than $20.

13        [(6)] (7)  The amount shown on the table is the support amount for the total number of

14    children, not an amount per child.
