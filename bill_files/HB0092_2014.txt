    (1)  The Legislature finds that:

498

    
will retire early in the 21st Century;
            
499

    
    (b)  Utah public schools have many mid-career faculty that could become the next wave
            
500

    
of administrators if they were prepared with a doctorate in education degree that emphasized
            
501

    
curriculum and instruction;
            
502

    
    (c)  each of Utah's community colleges have several faculty that need a terminal degree
            
503

    
and further knowledge in curriculum development and state-of-the-art instructional
            
504

    
methodology, and these individuals, being mid-career, find it difficult to relocate to a college
            
505

    
campus for a traditional program; and
            
506

    
    (d)  the state and its students will be better served if faculty and administrators are more

515

    
    (b)  structuring of the program to make it identical to a regular campus program in rigor
            
516

    
and course work; and

    (c)  providing a support system from at least the following five departments at the

524


    
    (4)  The university shall augment the program with off-campus summer courses, with
            
525

    
those courses eventually being offered over the [UEN-EDNET] system established under Title
            
526

    
53B, Chapter 17, Part 1, Educational Telecommunications.
