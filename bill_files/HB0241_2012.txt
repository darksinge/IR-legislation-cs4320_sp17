9

    
    This bill amends Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services by amending the
            
10

    
procedure for taking a foster child away from a foster parent who is that child's relative.
            
11

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
12

    
    This bill:
            
13

    
    .    prohibits the Division of Child and Family services from removing a foster child
            
14

    
from a foster parent who is the child's relative without clear and convincing
            
15

    
evidence that the relative is incapable of caring for the child; and
            
16

    
    .    makes technical changes.

 Utah Code Sections Affected:
            
22

    
AMENDS:
            
23

    
     62A-4a-206, as last amended by Laws of Utah 2010, Chapter 56
            
24

    

            
25

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
26

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
62A-4a-206

 is amended to read:
            
27

    
     62A-4a-206.  Process for removal of a child from foster family -- Procedural due

            
28


    
 process.
            
29

    
    (1) (a)  The Legislature finds that, except with regard to a child's natural parent or legal
            
30

    
guardian, a foster family has a very limited but recognized interest in its familial relationship
            
31

    
with a foster child who has been in the care and custody of that family.  In making
            
32

    
determinations regarding removal of a child from a foster home, the division may not dismiss
            
33

    
the foster family as a mere collection of unrelated individuals.
            
34

    
    (b)  The Legislature finds that children in the temporary custody and custody of the
            
35

    
division are experiencing multiple changes in foster care placements with little or no
            
36

    
documentation, and that numerous studies of child growth and development emphasize the
            
37

    
importance of stability in foster care living arrangements.
            
38

    
    (c)  For the reasons described in Subsections (1)(a) and (b), the division shall provide
            
39

    
procedural due process for a foster family prior to removal of a foster child from their home,
            
40

    
regardless of the length of time the child has been in that home, unless removal is for the
            
41

    
purpose of:
            
42

    
    (i)  returning the child to the child's natural parent or legal guardian;
            
43

    
    (ii)  immediately placing the child in an approved adoptive home;
            
44

    
    (iii)  placing the child with a relative, as defined in Subsection 

78A-6-307

(1)(b), who
            
45

    
obtained custody or asserted an interest in the child within the preference period described in
            
46

    
Subsection 

78A-6-307

(18)(a); or
            
47

    
    (iv)  placing an Indian child in accordance with preplacement preferences and other
            
48

    
requirements described in the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1915.
            
49

    
    (2) (a)  The division shall maintain and utilize due process procedures for removal of a
            
50

    
foster child from a foster home, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Title
            
51

    
63G, Chapter 4, Administrative Procedures Act.
            
52

    
    (b)  Those procedures shall include requirements for:
            
53

    
    (i)  personal communication with, and a written explanation of the reasons for the
            
54

    
removal to, the foster parents prior to removal of the child; and
            
55

    
    (ii)  an opportunity for foster parents to present their information and concerns to the
            
56

    
division and to:
            
57

    
    (A)  request a review, to be held before removal of the child, by a third party neutral
            
58

    
fact finder; or

            
59


    
    (B)  if the child has been placed with the foster parents for a period of at least two years,
            
60

    
request a review, to be held before removal of the child, by:
            
61

    
    (I)  the juvenile court judge currently assigned to the child's case; or
            
62

    
    (II)  if the juvenile court judge currently assigned to the child's case is not available,
            
63

    
another juvenile court judge.
            
64

    
    (c)  If the division determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the child is
            
65

    
in danger or that there is a substantial threat of danger to the health or welfare of the child, it
            
66

    
shall place the child in emergency foster care during the pendency of the procedures described
            
67

    
in this subsection, instead of making another foster care placement.
            
68

    
    (3)  If the division removes a child from a foster home based upon the child's statement
            
69

    
alone, the division shall initiate and expedite the processes described in Subsection (2).  The
            
70

    
division may take no formal action with regard to that foster parent's license until after those
            
71

    
processes, in addition to any other procedure or hearing required by law, have been completed.
            
72

    
    (4)  When a complaint is made to the division by a foster child against a foster parent,
            
73

    
the division shall, within 30 business days, provide the foster parent with information regarding
            
74

    
the specific nature of the complaint, the time and place of the alleged incident, and who was
            
75

    
alleged to have been involved.
            
76

    
    (5)  Whenever the division places a child in a foster home, it shall provide the foster
            
77

    
parents with:
            
78

    
    (a)  notification of the requirements of this section;
            
79

    
    (b)  a written description of the procedures enacted by the division pursuant to
            
80

    
Subsection (2) and how to access those processes; and
            
81

    
    (c)  written notification of the foster parents' ability to petition the juvenile court
            
82

    
directly for review of a decision to remove a foster child who has been in their custody for 12
            
83

    
months or longer, in accordance with the limitations and requirements of Section 

78A-6-318

.
            
84

    
    (6)  The requirements of this section do not apply to the removal of a child based on a
            
85

    
foster parent's request for that removal.
            
86

    
    (7)  It is unlawful for a person, with the intent to avoid compliance with the
            
87

    
requirements of this section, to:
            
88

    
    (a)  take action, or encourage another to take action, against the license of a foster
            
89

    
parent; or

            
90


    
    (b)  remove a child from a foster home before the child has been placed with the foster
            
91

    
parents for two years.
            
92

    
    (8)  The division may not remove a foster child from a foster parent who is a relative, as
            
93

    
defined in Subsection 

78A-6-307

(1)(b), of the child on the basis of the age or health of the
            
94

    
foster parent without clear and convincing evidence that the foster parent is incapable of caring
            
95

    
for the foster child.
