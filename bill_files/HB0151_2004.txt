575

    
    (b) (i)  The court may consider all relevant evidence, in accordance with the Utah Rules

578

    
guardian of the minor, the requesting party, or their counsel, but may in its discretion limit

580

    
continued protection.
            
581

    
    (6)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to
            
582

    
the court:
            
583

    (7)  The court shall consider all relevant evidence provided by persons or entities

594

    
cause shown, the court may grant no more than one time-limited continuance, not to exceed
            
595

    
five judicial days.
            
596

    
    (9) (a)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order that
            
597

    
the minor be released from the protective custody of the division unless it finds, by a
            
598

    
preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist:
            
599

    
    [(a)] (i)  there is a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the minor and
            
600

    
the minor's physical health or safety may not be protected without removing [him] the minor
            
601

    
from [his parent's] the custody of the minor's parent or guardian.  If a minor has previously
            
602

    
been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent incident of abuse,
            
603

    
neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot
            
604

    
safely remain in the custody of [his] the minor's parent or guardian;
            
605

    
    [(b)] (ii)  the minor is suffering emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but is not
            
606

    
limited to, extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward
            
607

    
self or others, and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor's emotional
            
608

    
health may be protected without removing the minor from the custody of [his] the minor's
            
609

    
parent or guardian;
            
610

    
    [(c)] (iii)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been
            
611

    
physically or sexually abused, or is considered to be at substantial risk of being physically or
            
612

    
sexually abused, by a parent, a member of the parent's household, or other person known to the
            
613

    
parent[.  If a parent has received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known
            
614

    
to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in
            
615

    
the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the
            
616

    
child is at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused];

            
617


    
    [(d)] (iv)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;
            
618

    
    [(e)] (v)  the minor has been left without any provision for [his] the minor's support;
            
619

    
    [(f)] (vi)  a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot
            
620

    
arrange for safe and appropriate care for the minor;
            
621

    
    [(g)] (vii)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the
            
622

    
parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the
            
623

    
parent are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful;
            
624

    
    [(h)] (viii)  the minor is in immediate need of medical care;
            
625

    
    [(i)] (ix)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a
            
626

    
threat to the child's health or safety;
            
627

    
    [(j)] (x)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been neglected;
            
628

    
    [(k)] (xi)  the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been
            
629

    
charged or arrested pursuant to Title 58, Chapter 37d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any
            
630

    
clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section 

58-37d-3

, was located in the residence
            
631

    
or on the property where the child resided; or
            
632

    
    [(l)] (xii)  the child's welfare is otherwise endangered.
            
633

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(a)(iii), if a parent has received actual notice that
            
634

    
physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence
            
635

    
that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that
            
636

    
fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or
            
637

    
sexually abused.
            
638

    
    (10) (a)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether
            
639

    
reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from
            
640

    
[his] the minor's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for
            
641

    
continued removal.  If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of
            
642

    
[his] the minor's parent or guardian through the provision of those services, it shall place the
            
643

    
minor with [his] the minor's parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the
            
644

    
division.
            
645

    
    (b)  In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child's
            
646

    
health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.
            
647

    
    (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency

            
648


    
situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that
            
649

    
any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
650

    
    (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
651

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
652

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in [his] the child's home, return a
            
653

    
child to [his] the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the
            
654

    
offending parent or parents.
            
655

    
    (13)  The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of
            
656

    
educational neglect as described in Subsection 

78-3a-103

(1)(s)(ii).
            
657

    
    (14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it
            
658

    
shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
659

    
    (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall
            
660

    
state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
661

    
    (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for
            
662

    
the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if [he] the child were returned
            
663

    
home, [it] the court shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal
            
664

    
of the child, or the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural
            
665

    
requirement of this chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
666

    
    Section 12.   Effective date.
            
667

    
    This bill takes effect on July 1, 2004.
