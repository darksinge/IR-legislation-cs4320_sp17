30

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
31

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
53A-6-102

 is amended to read:
            
32

    
     53A-6-102.   Legislative findings on teacher quality -- Declaration of education as
            
33

    
 a profession -- Annual report.
            
34

    
    (1) (a)  The Legislature acknowledges that education is perhaps the most important
            
35

    
function of state and local governments, recognizing that the future success of our state and
            
36

    
nation depend in large part upon the existence of a responsible and educated citizenry.
            
37

    
    (b)  The Legislature further acknowledges that the primary responsibility for the
            
38

    
education of children within the state resides with their parents or guardians and that the role of
            
39

    
state and local governments is to support and assist parents in fulfilling that responsibility.
            
40

    
    (2) (a)  The Legislature finds that:
            
41

    
    (i)  quality teaching is the basic building block of successful schools and, outside of
            
42

    
home and family circumstances, the essential component of student achievement;
            
43

    
    (ii)  the high quality of teachers is absolutely essential to enhance student achievement
            
44

    
and to assure educational excellence in each classroom in the state's public schools; and
            
45

    
    (iii)  the implementation of a comprehensive continuum of data-driven strategies
            
46

    
regarding recruitment, preservice, licensure, induction, professional development, and
            
47

    
evaluation is essential if the state and its citizens expect every classroom to be staffed by a
            
48

    
skilled, caring, and effective teacher.
            
49

    
    (b)  In providing for the safe and effective performance of the function of educating
            
50

    
Utah's children, the Legislature further finds it to be of critical importance that education,
            
51

    
including instruction, administrative, and supervisory services, be recognized as a profession,
            
52

    
and that those who are licensed or seek to become licensed and to serve as educators:
            
53

    
    (i)  meet high standards both as to qualifications and fitness for service as educators
            
54

    
through quality recruitment and preservice programs before assuming their responsibilities in
            
55

    
the schools;
            
56

    
    (ii)  maintain those standards in the performance of their duties while holding licenses,
            
57

    
in large part through participating in induction and ongoing professional development
            
58

    
programs focused on instructional improvement;

            
59


    
    (iii)  receive fair, systematic evaluations of their performance at school for the purpose
            
60

    
of enhancing the quality of public education and student achievement; and
            
61

    
    (iv)  have access to a process for fair examination and review of allegations made
            
62

    
against them and for the administration of appropriate sanctions against those found, in
            
63

    
accordance with due process, to have failed to conduct themselves in a manner commensurate
            
64

    
with their authority and responsibility to provide appropriate professional services to the
            
65

    
children of the state.
            
66

    
    [(3)  The State Board of Education and the State Board of Regents shall make an annual
            
67

    
report to the Legislature through the Education Interim Committee on the status of teacher
            
68

    
quality in the state based on the continuum referred to in Subsection (2)(a)(iii), to include
            
69

    
adequate and reliable data on the state's supply of and demand for teachers.]
