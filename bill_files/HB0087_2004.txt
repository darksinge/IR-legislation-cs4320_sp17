21

    

            
22

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
23

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
30-3-10

 is amended to read:
            
24

    
     30-3-10.  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce -- Custody
            
25

    
 consideration.
            
26

    
    (1)  If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is
            
27

    
declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the


            
28


    
minor children as it considers appropriate.
            
29

    
    (a)  In determining any form of custody, the court shall consider the best interests of the
            
30

    
child and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the following:
            
31

    
    (i)  the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties;
            
32

    
    (ii)  which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including
            
33

    
allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent; and
            
34

    
    (iii)  those factors outlined in Section 

30-3-10.2

.
            
35

    
    (b)  The court shall, in every case, consider joint custody but may award any form of
            
36

    
custody which is determined to be in the best interest of the child.
            
37

    
    (c)  The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact
            
38

    
determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the
            
39

    
children be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.  The court
            
40

    
may allow testimony from a child 12 years of age or older who expresses a desire to testify.
            
41

    
    (d)  The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children's
            
42

    
desires regarding future custody or parent-time schedules, but the expressed desires are not
            
43

    
controlling and the court may determine the children's custody or parent-time otherwise.  The
            
44

    
desires of a child 16 years of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single
            
45

    
controlling factor.
            
46

    
    (e)  If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection
            
47

    
(1)(d), they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be
            
48

    
obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only
            
49

    
method to ascertain the child's desires regarding custody.
            
50

    
    (2)  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds
            
51

    
relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing
            
52

    
the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds
            
53

    
appropriate.
            
54

    
    (3)  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has
            
55

    
attempted to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into
            
56

    
consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other parent.
            
57

    
    (4) (a)  A court may not discriminate against a parent due to a disability, as defined in
            
58

    
Section 

57-21-2

, in awarding custody or determining whether a substantial change has occurred

            
59


    
for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.
            
60

    
    (b)  If a court takes a parent's disability into account in awarding custody or determining
            
61

    
whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody,
            
62

    
the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising
            
63

    
therefrom by showing that:
            
64

    
    (i)  the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent's ability to
            
65

    
provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue; or
            
66

    
    (ii)  the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources
            
67

    
available to supplement the parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of
            
68

    
the child at issue.
            
69

    
    (c)  Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to:
            
70

    
    (i)  abuse, neglect, or dependency proceedings under Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and
            
71

    
Family Services, or Title 78, Chapter 3a, Juvenile Court Act of 1996; or
            
72

    
    (ii)  adoption proceedings under Title 78, Chapter 30, Adoption.
            
73

    
    (5)  This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint
            
74

    
legal custody, joint physical custody, or sole custody, but allows the court and the family the
            
75

    
widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.
