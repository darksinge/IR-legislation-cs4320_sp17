The court may also provide an opportunity for the minor to testify.                                 b   The court may consider all relevant evidence, in accordance with the Utah Rules of                            Juvenile Procedure.  The court shall hear relevant evidence presented by the minor, his parent or                            guardian, the requesting party, or their counsel, but may in its discretion limit testimony and                            evidence to only that which goes to the issues of removal and the child s need for continued                            protection.                                     If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to the                            court                                  a   the reasons why the minor was removed from the parent s or guardian s custody                                  b   any services provided to the child and his family in an effort to prevent removal                                  c   the need, if any, for continued shelter                                  d   the available services that could facilitate the return of the minor to the custody of his                            parent or guardian  and                                 e   whether the child has any relatives who may be able and willing to take temporary                            custody.                                     If necessary to protect the child, preserve the rights of a party, or for other good cause                               shown, the court may grant no more than one time limited continuance, not to exceed five judicial                            days.                                     The court shall order that the minor be released from the protective custody of the                            division unless it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist                                  a   there is a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the minor and the minor s                            physical health or safety may not be protected without removing him from his parent s custody.                             If a minor has previously been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent                            incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the                            child cannot safely remain in the custody of his parent                                  b   the minor is suffering emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but is not limited to,                            extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward self or others,                            and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor s emotional health may be                            protected without removing the minor from the custody of his parent                                  c   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been physically or                            sexually abused, or is deemed to be at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused, by                            a parent, a member of the parent s household, or other person known to the parent.  If a parent has                            received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred,                            and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the                            alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of                            being physically or sexually abused                                  d   the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child                                  e   the minor has been left without any provision for his support                                  f   a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for                            safe and appropriate care for the minor                                  g   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the parent is                            unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the parent are                            unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful                                  h   the minor is in immediate need of medical care                                  i   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to                            the child s health or safety                                  j   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been neglected                                     k   the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been charged                            or arrested pursuant to Title   , Chapter   d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any clandestine                            laboratory operation, as defined in Section          d      , was located in the residence or on the                            property where the child resided  or                                 l   the child s welfare is otherwise endangered.                                     a   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether reasonable                            efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his home and                            whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued removal.  If the                            court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or guardian through                            the provision of those services, it shall place the minor with his parent or guardian and order that                            those services be provided by the division.                                 b   In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child s health,                             safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.                                      Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency                            situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that                            any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                                      In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or                            neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable efforts                             or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in his home, return a child to his home, provide                            reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                                       The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of                            educational neglect as described in Subsection         a             q   r  ii .                                      a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it shall                            state the facts on which that decision is based.                                 b   If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall state                            the facts on which that decision is based.                                      If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody is necessary for the                            protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned home, it shall order                            continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child, or the failure of a                            party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title                              A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.
