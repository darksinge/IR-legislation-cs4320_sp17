A financing statement covering timber to be cut or covering minerals or the like                            including oil and gas  or accounts subject to Subsection       A             , or a financing statement                              filed as a fixture filing  Section       A            where the debtor is not a transmitting utility, must                           show that it covers this type of collateral, must recite that it is to be recorded in the real estate                           records of the county recorder, and the financing statement  and any amendments of financing                           statements, continuation statements, termination statements, statements of assignment, or                           statements of release covering the same collateral  must contain a legal description of the real                           estate and must specify the name of the record owner.                                    a   A mortgage is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing from the                           date of its recording if                                 i   the goods are described in the mortgage by item or type                                 ii   the goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real estate described in the                            mortgage                                  iii   the mortgage complies with the requirements for a financing statement in this section                            other than a recital that it is to be filed in the real estate records  and                                 iv   the mortgage is duly recorded.                                 b   No fee with reference to the financing statement is required other than the regular                            recording and satisfaction fees with respect to the mortgage.                                     A financing statement sufficiently shows the name of the debtor if it gives the                            individual, partnership, or corporate name of the debtor, whether or not it adds other trade names                            or the names of partners.  Where the debtor so changes the debtor s name or in the case of an                            organization its name, identity, or corporate structure that a filed financing statement becomes                            seriously misleading, the filing is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired                            by the debtor more than four months after the change, unless a new appropriate financing statement                            is filed before the expiration of that time.  A filed financing statement remains effective with                            respect to collateral transferred by the debtor even though the secured party knows of or consents                            to the transfer.                                     A financing statement substantially complying with the requirements of this section                            is effective even though it contains minor errors which are not seriously misleading.
