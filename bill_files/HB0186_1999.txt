if the dispute to be                            arbitrated is not already the subject of legal action, the district court having jurisdiction over the                               county where the

ripe for review                                  ii   assuming the alleged facts are true, no cause of action exists under United States or                            Utah law                                  iii   all issues raised are beyond the scope of the ombudsman s statutory duty to review                             or                                 iv   the arbitration is otherwise not appropriate.                                 c   i   The private property ombudsman shall appoint another person to arbitrate the                            dispute when

            A   agreeable to both parties  or                                 B   agreeable to the party paying for the arbitrator and the private property ombudsman.                                 iii   The private property ombudsman may, on his own initiative or upon agreement of                            both parties, appoint a panel of arbitrators to conduct the arbitration.                                 d   In arbitrating a dispute, the arbitrator shall apply the relevant statutes, case law,                            regulations, and rules of Utah and the United States in conducting the arbitration and in                            determining the award.                                 e   Arbitration by or through the private property ombudsman is not necessary before                            bringing legal action to adjudicate any claim.                                 f   The lack of arbitration by or through the private property ombudsman does not                               constitute, and may not be interpreted as constituting, a failure to exhaust available administrative                            remedies or as a bar to bringing legal action.                                 g   Arbitration under this section is not subject to Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                            Procedures Act, nor Title   , Chapter   b, Alternative Dispute

is based to the district court for de novo review.                                 i   The filing with the private property ombudsman of a request for arbitration does not                           stay any county or municipal land use decision, including the decision of a board of adjustment.                                     The private property ombudsman may not be compelled to testify in a civil action filed                            with regard to the subject matter of any review or arbitration by the ombudsman.                                     a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , evidence of a review by the private                            property ombudsman and his opinions, writings, findings, and determinations are not admissible                            as evidence in an action subsequently brought in court and dealing with the same dispute.                                 b   Subsection     a  does not apply to                                  i   actions brought under authority of Title   , Chapter  , Small Claims Court                                  ii   a judicial confirmation or review of the arbitration itself as authorized in Title   ,                            Chapter   a, the Utah Arbitration Act  or                                 iii   actions for de novo review of an arbitration award or issue brought under the authority                            of Subsection     h .

An action submitted to the private property ombudsman under authority of this section                           does                                      a   i   Except as provided in Subsection     a  ii , a mediator or arbitrator may stay an                           action brought in district court under this chapter by filing with the court a notice of mediation or                              arbitration if the mediator or arbitrator determines that a stay is reasonably necessary to reach a                           resolution of the case through mediation or arbitration.                                 ii   A mediator or arbitrator may not bar or stay any action for occupancy of premises                            authorized by Section                .                                 b   The mediator or arbitrator shall file with the district court a request to terminate the                           stay within    days after                                  i   the resolution of the dispute through mediation                                  ii   the issuance of a final arbitration award  or                                 iii   a determination by the mediator or arbitrator that mediation or arbitration is not                           appropriate.                                     a   The private property owner or displaced person may request that the mediator or                            arbitrator authorize an additional appraisal.                                 b   If the mediator or arbitrator determines that an additional appraisal is reasonably                            necessary to reach a resolution of the case, the mediator or arbitrator may                                  i   have an additional appraisal of the property prepared by an independent appraiser  and                                 ii   require the agency to pay the costs of the first additional appraisal.
