55

    
that there is no interest in restricting access to the record, or that the interests favoring access
            
56

    
outweighs the interest favoring restriction of access.
            
57

    
    (6) (a)  The disclosure of records to which access is governed or limited pursuant to
            
58

60

    
or for receiving state or federal funds, is governed by the specific provisions of that statute,

93

    
be in the public interest.
            
94

    
    (b)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the rights or protections
            
95

    
granted to the governmental entity under federal copyright or patent law as a result of its

ownership of the intellectual property right.

104

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding the other provisions in this section except when Subsection (4)
            
105

    
applies, if a governmental entity determines that a requested compilation of records has a
            
106

    
commercial value as compared to similar documents available in the market place, the
            
107

    
governmental entity shall charge fair commercial value for providing the compilation of
            
108

    
records to the person requesting the compilation of records.
            
109

    
    (c)  A fee charged under this section shall be approved by the governmental entity's

governmental entity, the actual costs under this section may include the following:
            
114

    
    [(a)] (i)  the cost of staff time for summarizing, compiling, or tailoring the record either
            
115

    
into an organization or media to meet the person's request;
            
116

    
    [(b)] (ii)  the cost of staff time for search, retrieval, and other direct administrative costs

118

    
employee who, in the discretion of the custodian of records, has the necessary skill and training
            
119

    
to perform the request; provided, however, that no charge may be made for the first quarter
            
120

    
hour of staff time]; and

            
121


    
    [(c)] (iii)  in the case of fees for a record that is the result of computer output other than
            
122

    
word processing, the actual incremental cost of providing the electronic services and products
            
123

    
together with a reasonable portion of the costs associated with formatting or interfacing the
            
124

    
information for particular users, and the administrative costs as set forth in Subsections
            
125

    
(2)(a)(i) and [(b)] (ii).
            
126

    
    (b) (i)  An hourly charge for the cost of staff time may not exceed the salary of the
            
127

    
lowest paid employee who, in the discretion of the custodian of the record, has the necessary
            
128

    
skill and training to perform the request.
            
129

    
    (ii)    A charge may not be made for the first quarter hour of staff time.
            
130

    
    (c)  Subsection (1) and this Subsection (2) may not be interpreted as requiring a
            
131

    
governmental entity to manipulate records in such a way as to create a record that the
            
132

    
governmental entity does not otherwise maintain including:
            
133

    
    (i)  a compilation of records; or
            
134

    
    (ii)  a summary of one or more records.
            
135

    
    (3)  Fees shall be established as [follows:] provided in this Subsection (3).
            
136

    
    (a)  Governmental entities with fees established by the Legislature shall establish the
            
137

    
fees defined in Subsection (2), or other actual costs associated with this section through the
            
138

    
budget process.  Governmental entities with fees established by the Legislature that are set on
            
139

    
the basis of cost may use the procedures of  Section 

63-38-3.2

 to set fees until the Legislature
            
140

    
establishes fees through the budget process.  A fee set by a governmental entity in accordance
            
141

    
with Section 

63-38-3.2

 expires on May 1, 1995.

    (c)  The judiciary shall establish fees by rules of the judicial council.
            
145

    
    (4)  A governmental entity may fulfill a record request without charge and is
            
146

    
encouraged to do so when [it] the governmental entity determines that:
            
147

    
    (a)  releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a person;
            
148

    
    (b)  the individual requesting the record is:
            
149

    
    (i)  the subject of the record[,]; or
            
150

    
    (ii)  an individual specified in Subsection 

63-2-202

(1) or (2); or
            
151

    
    (c) (i)  the requester's legal rights are directly implicated by the information in the

            
152


    
record[,]; and
            
153

    
    (ii)  the requester is impecunious.
            
154

    
    (5)  A governmental entity may not charge a fee for:
            
155

    
    (a)  reviewing a record to determine whether it is subject to disclosure, except as
            
156

    
permitted by Subsection (2)[(b)] (a)(i); or
            
157

    
    (b)  inspecting a record.
            
158

    
    (6) (a)  A person who believes that there has been an unreasonable denial of a fee
            
159

    
waiver under Subsection (4) may appeal the denial in the same manner as a person appeals
            
160

    
when inspection of a public record is denied under Section 

63-2-205

.
            
161

    
    (b)  The adjudicative body hearing the appeal has the same authority when a fee waiver
            
162

    
or reduction is denied as it has when the inspection of a public record is denied.
            
163

    
    (7) (a)  All fees received under this section by a governmental entity subject to
            
164

    
Subsection (3)(a) shall be retained by the governmental entity as a dedicated credit.
            
165

    
    (b)  Those funds shall be used to recover the actual cost and expenses incurred by the
            
166

    
governmental entity in providing the requested record or record series.
            
167

    
    (8) (a)  A governmental entity may require payment of past fees and future estimated
            
168

    
fees before beginning to process a request if:
            
169

    
    (i)  fees are expected to exceed $50[,]; or [if]
            
170

    
    (ii)  the requester has not paid fees from previous requests.
            
171

    
    (b)  Any prepaid amount in excess of fees due shall be returned to the requester.
            
172

    
    (9)  This section does not alter, repeal, or reduce fees established by other statutes or
            
173

    
legislative acts.
            
174
