Section 62A-4a-201 is amended to read:1358          62A-4a-201. Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of1359     state.1360          (1) (a)  Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a1361     parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the1362     parent's children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves1363     to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions1364     or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's1365     children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened1366     protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty1367     interests and, concomitantly, the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent.1368          (b)  The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and1369     management of the parent's children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist1370     simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent's child is placed in1371     the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing1372     the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government1373     action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or1374     alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental1375     unfitness, and the child suffers, or is substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result,1376     the child and the child's parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of1377     their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child's parents are1378     adversaries.1379          (c)  It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and1380     supervision of the child's natural parents.  A child's need for a normal family life in a1381     permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the1382     child's natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to1383     conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected.  The right of a fit, competent1384     parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a fundamental1385     liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental1386     public policy of this state.1387          (d)  The state recognizes that:1388          (i)  a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,1389     train, educate, provide and care for, and reasonably discipline the parent's children; and1390          (ii)  the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.1391          (e)  It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty1392     to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their1393     children.1394          (f)  Subsections (2) through (7) shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this1395     Subsection (1).1396          (2)  It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection1397     from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,1398     prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title 78A,1399     Chapter 6, Juvenile Court Act [of 1996].  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest1400     in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide1401     for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a1402     substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and1403     proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take action for1404     the welfare and protection of the parent's children.1405          (3)  When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,1406     it shall take into account the child's need for protection from immediate harm and the extent to1407     which the child's extended family may provide needed protection.  Throughout its involvement,1408     the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to protect a1409     child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families, rather1410     than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.1411          (4)  When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child's immediate safety1412     or welfare, the division may seek custody of the child for a planned, temporary period and1413     place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this section and in1414     accordance with the requirements of Title 78A, Chapter 6, Part 3, Abuse, Neglect, and1415     Dependency Proceedings, and:1416          (a)  when safe and appropriate, return the child to the child's parent; or1417          (b)  as a last resort, pursue another permanency plan.1418          (5)  In determining and making "reasonable efforts" with regard to a child, pursuant to1419     the provisions of Section 62A-4a-203, both the division's and the court's paramount concern1420     shall be the child's health, safety, and welfare.  The desires of a parent for the parent's child,1421     and the constitutionally protected rights of a parent, as described in this section, shall be given1422     full and serious consideration by the division and the court.1423          (6)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe1424     abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or1425     to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child's home, provide reunification1426     services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection (6) does1427     not exempt the division from providing court-ordered services.1428          (7) (a)  In accordance with Subsection (1), the division shall strive to achieve1429     appropriate permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.

and4228          (B)  a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent occurs.4229          (ii)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(a)(iv), if the court finds that the parent knowingly4230     allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice4231     that the person physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited the child, that fact4232     constitutes prima facie evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically4233     abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited.4234          (10) (a) (i)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether4235     reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the4236     child's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued4237     removal.4238          (ii)  If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child's4239     parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with4240     the child's parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.4241          (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (10)(a), and in ordering and4242     providing services, the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in4243     accordance with federal law.4244          (11)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency4245     situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that4246     any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.4247          (12)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe4248     abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make4249     "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child's home,4250     return a child to the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the4251     offending parent or parents.4252          (13)  The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of4253     educational neglect as described in Subsection 78A-6-105[(27)](35)(b), truancy, or failure to4254     comply with a court order to attend school.4255          (14) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section, the4256     court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.4257          (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home, the court shall4258     state the facts on which that decision is based.4259          (15)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for4260     the protection of a child pursuant to Subsection (9)(a), the court shall order continued removal4261     regardless of:4262          (a)  any error in the initial removal of the child;4263          (b)  the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions; or4264          (c)  any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child4265     and Family Services.4266          Section 60.  Section 78A-6-312 is amended to read:4267          78A-6-312. Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.4268          (1)  The court may:4269          (a)  make any of the dispositions described in Section 78A-6-117;4270          (b)  place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any:4271          (i)  individual; or4272          (ii)  public or private entity or agency; or4273          (c)  order:4274          (i)  protective supervision;4275          (ii)  family preservation;4276          (iii)  subject to Subsections (12)(b), 78A-6-105[(27)](35)(d), and 78A-6-117(2)(n) and4277     Section 78A-6-301.5, medical or mental health treatment; or4278          (iv)  other services.4279          (2)  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that4280     the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:4281          (a)  establish a primary permanency plan for the minor; and4282          (b)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency plan, reunification services4283     are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsections (20) through (22).4284          (3)  Subject to Subsections (6) and (7), if the court determines that reunification4285     services are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for4286     reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,4287     unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.4288          (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe4289     abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make4290     "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to4291     attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.4292          (5)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount4293     concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.4294          (6)  For purposes of Subsection (3), parent-time is in the best interests of a minor unless4295     the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:4296          (a)  protect the physical safety of the minor;4297          (b)  protect the life of the minor; or4298          (c)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the4299     minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.4300          (7)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), a court may not deny parent-time based solely on a4301     parent's failure to:4302          (a)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or4303          (b)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.4304          (8) (a)  In addition to the primary permanency plan, the court shall establish a4305     concurrent permanency plan that shall include:4306          (i)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency plan will4307     be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency plan; and4308          (ii)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency4309     plan.4310          (b)  In determining the primary permanency plan and concurrent permanency plan, the4311     court shall consider:4312          (i)  the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement;4313          (ii)  the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent-child relationship is legally4314     terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available; and4315          (iii)  the use of an individualized permanency plan, only as a last resort.4316          (9)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection4317     78A-6-314(1)(b) within 30 days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if4318     something other than reunification is initially established as a minor's primary permanency4319     plan.4320          (10) (a)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency plan before the4321     establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 78A-6-314.4322          (b)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency plan in the event4323     that the primary permanency plan is abandoned.4324          (c)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor's primary4325     permanency plan, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section4326     78A-6-314 on or before the earlier of:4327          (i)  30 days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this4328     Subsection (10)(c); or4329          (ii)  the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section4330     78A-6-314, ends.4331          (11) (a)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, [it] the court4332     shall order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the4333     minor's parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period4334     of time.4335          (b)  In providing the services described in Subsection (11)(a), the minor's health, safety,4336     and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.4337          (12) (a)  The court shall:4338          (i)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child4339     and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;4340          (ii)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family4341     plan in accordance with Subsection 62A-4a-205(6)(e); and4342          (iii)  identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties,4343     the responsibilities described in Subsection (12)(a)(ii), for the purpose of assisting in any future4344     determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and4345     federal law.4346          (b)  If the parent is in a substance [abuse] use disorder treatment program, other than a4347     certified drug court program:4348          (i)  the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in4349     addition to the testing recommended by the parent's substance [abuse] use disorder program4350     based on a finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol; and4351          (ii)  the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing4352     recommended by the substance [abuse] use disorder program to the court or division.4353          (13) (a)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the4354     date that the minor was initially removed from the minor's home, unless the time period is4355     extended under Subsection 78A-6-314(7).4356          (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 124357     months of reunification services.4358          (14) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at4359     any time.4360          (b)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined4361     to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section4362     78A-6-314, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:4363          (i)  place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan; and4364          (ii)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the4365     minor.4366          (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period4367     described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.4368          (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted4369     by the court in accordance with Section 78A-6-314 at the expiration of the time period for4370     reunification services.4371          (b)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original4372     removal of the minor.4373          (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted4374     within 30 days, in accordance with Section 78A-6-314.4375          (17)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are4376     ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six4377     months from the date that reunification services were ordered:4378          (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and4379          (b)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.4380          (18)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section4381     78A-6-314, the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the4382     sibling group together is:4383          (a)  practicable; and4384          (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.4385          (19) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide4386     permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a4387     parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.4388          (b)  The court may determine that:4389          (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,4390     based on the individual circumstances; and4391          (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.4392          (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in4393     making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount4394     concern.4395          (20)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a4396     parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following4397     circumstances exist:4398          (a)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit4399     indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;4400          (b)  subject to Subsection (21)(a), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such4401     magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;4402          (c)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,4403     sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:4404          (i)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;4405          (ii)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and4406          (iii)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual4407     exploitation;4408          (d)  the parent:4409          (i)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect;4410          (ii)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:4411          (A)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or4412          (B)  child abuse homicide;4413          (iii)  committed sexual abuse against the child;4414          (iv)  is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender; or4415          (v) (A)  intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the4416     child;4417          (B)  is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation4418     for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child; or4419          (C)  is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or4420     recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child;4421          (e)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the4422     parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the4423     minor;4424          (f)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,4425     and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the4426     offending parent;4427          (g)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;4428          (h)  the minor was removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions4429     and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;4430          (i)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;4431          (j)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a4432     location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation4433     was located;4434          (k)  except as provided in Subsection (21)(b), with respect to a parent who is the child's4435     birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or was4436     exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child's mother while the child4437     was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the mother4438     agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a4439     substance [abuse] use disorder treatment program approved by the department; or4440          (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification4441     efforts or services.4442          (21) (a)  The finding under Subsection (20)(b) shall be based on competent evidence4443     from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing4444     that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately4445     caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is made.4446          (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection (20)(k) if the court finds, under4447     the circumstances of the case, that the substance [abuse] use disorder treatment described in4448     Subsection (20)(k) is not warranted.4449          (22)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take4450     into consideration:4451          (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child4452     and family plan;4453          (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of4454     drugs or alcohol;4455          (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family4456     member;4457          (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;4458          (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;4459          (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be4460     successful; and4461          (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.4462          (23) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections (19) through4463     (21), and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which4464     the out-of-home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide4465     reunification services.4466          (b)  The time limits described in Subsections (2) through (18) are not tolled by the4467     parent's absence.4468          (24) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable4469     services unless [it] the court determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.4470          (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (24)(a), the court shall4471     consider:4472          (i)  the age of the minor;4473          (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;4474          (iii)  the length of the sentence;4475          (iv)  the nature of the treatment;4476          (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;4477          (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;4478          (vii)  for a minor 10 years old or older, the minor's attitude toward the implementation4479     of family reunification services; and4480          (viii)  any other appropriate factors.4481          (c)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations4482     imposed in Subsections (2) through (18).4483          (d)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time4484     limitations imposed in Subsections (2) through (18), unless the court determines that continued4485     reunification services would be in the minor's best interest.4486          (25)  If, pursuant to Subsections (20)(b) through (l), the court does not order4487     reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30 days, in accordance4488     with Section 78A-6-314.4489          Section 61.
