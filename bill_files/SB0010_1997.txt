    1997 GENERAL SESSION


    STATE OF UTAH


     Sponsor: Lyle W.  Hillyard


    AN ACT RELATING TO THE INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX ACT; REMOVING THE

    DESIGNATION FOR AND PROHIBITING THE COMMISSION FROM COLLECTING

    CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES; REQUIRING

    THE COMMISSION TO REPORT TO THE REVENUE AND TAXATION INTERIM

    COMMITTEE ON WHETHER CERTAIN STATUTORY PROVISIONS SHOULD BE

    REPEALED IF THE COMMISSION REMOVES THE DESIGNATION FOR A

    CONTRIBUTION; MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS; AND PROVIDING AN

    EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated 1953 as follows:

    AMENDS:

         59-10-530, as renumbered and amended by Chapter 2, Laws of Utah 1987

         59-10-530.5, as enacted by Chapter 123, Laws of Utah 1988

         59-10-549, as last amended by Chapter 39, Laws of Utah 1992

         59-10-550, as enacted by Chapter 131, Laws of Utah 1992

    ENACTS:

         59-10-551, Utah Code Annotated 1953

    Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

        Section 1.  Section  59-10-530 is amended to read:

         59-10-530.  Nongame wildlife contribution -- Credit to Wildlife Resources Account.

        (1)  The Legislature hereby declares that wildlife species which are endangered, threatened

    with extinction, not commonly pursued, killed, or consumed either for sport or profit, and are not

    nuisance predators presently being brought under control by the state referred to herein as

    "nongame wildlife," have need of special protection and that it is in the public interest to preserve,

    protect, perpetuate, and enhance nongame wildlife resources of this state through preservation of

    a satisfactory environment and an ecological balance.  The Legislature specifically recognizes that


    such nongame wildlife includes protected wildlife, endangered and threatened wildlife, aquatic

    wildlife, specialized habitat wildlife, both terrestrial and aquatic types, and mollusks, crustaceans,

    and other invertebrates under the jurisdiction of the Division of Wildlife Resources.  This section

    is enacted to provide a means by which such protection may be financially aided through a voluntary

    check-off designation on state income tax return forms.  The intent of the Legislature is that this

    program of the income tax check-off is supplemental to any other funding and in no way is intended

    to take the place of the funding that would otherwise be appropriated for this purpose.

        (2)  [Each] Except as provided in Section 59-10-551, each individual taxpayer required to

    file a return pursuant to Section 59-10-502 may designate on the return a contribution of $1, $5, $10,

    or another amount not less than $1, or no contribution, to the state Nongame Wildlife Program.  If

    the return is a joint return, any amount designated as a contribution to this program is to be deducted

    from the individual's state tax refund and shall be a joint contribution.  This option, once exercised,

    is irrevocable during the tax year in which it was effective.

        (3)  The commission may promulgate rules to effectuate the provisions of this section.

        (4)  The commission shall determine annually the total amount designated pursuant to this

    section and shall report such amount to the state treasurer who shall credit such amount to the

    Wildlife Resources Account as provided for in Section 23-14-14.

        (5)  This section applies to calendar-year taxpayers beginning January 1, 1980, and to

    fiscal-year taxpayers for any part of the taxable year accruing after December 31, 1979, and to all

    taxable years thereafter. 

        Section 2.  Section  59-10-530.5 is amended to read:

         59-10-530.5.  Homeless contribution -- Credit to Homeless Trust Account.

        (1)  [Each] Except as provided in Section 59-10-551, each taxpayer required to file a return

    pursuant to Section 59-10-502 may designate on the return a contribution of $2, $5, $10, or another

    amount not less than $2, or no contribution, to the state Homeless Trust Account.  Any amount

    designated as a contribution to this program is to be deducted from the individual's state tax refund

    and, if a joint return, shall be a joint contribution.  This option, once exercised, is irrevocable during

    the tax year in which it was effective.  If no refund is due, the taxpayer may remit the contribution

- 2 -


    with the return.

        (2)  The commission may promulgate rules to implement this section.

        (3)  The commission shall determine annually the total amount designated pursuant to this

    section and shall report such amount to the state treasurer who shall credit such amount to the

    Homeless Trust Account as provided for in Section 55-22-3.

        (4)  This section applies to calendar-year taxpayers beginning January 1, 1988, and to

    fiscal-year taxpayers for any part of the taxable year accruing after December 31, 1988, and to all

    taxable years thereafter. 

        Section 3.  Section  59-10-549 is amended to read:

         59-10-549.  Checkoff for education.

        (1)  [Any] Except as provided in Section 59-10-551, a taxpayer who files a return pursuant

    to Section 59-10-502 may designate on the return a contribution of the amount of his refund, if any,

    or any other amount to:

        (a)  the State Board of Regents for the following purposes:

        (i)  libraries; or

        (ii)  library equipment; or

        (b)  the foundation of any school district or any chapter of the Utah Public Education

    Foundation.

        (2)  Any amount designated as a contribution under Subsection (1) shall be deducted from

    the taxpayer's state tax refund.  If a joint return is filed, the contribution shall be a joint contribution. 

    This option, once exercised, is irrevocable during the tax year in which it was effective. If no refund

    is due, the taxpayer may remit the contribution with the return.

        (3)  If a taxpayer designates an amount as a contribution under Subsection (1)(a), but fails

    to direct the contribution to a particular institution, the designated contribution shall be directed to

    the State Board of Regents for libraries or library equipment.

        (4)  If a taxpayer designates an amount as a contribution under Subsection (1)(b), but fails

    to direct the contribution to a particular school district foundation, the designated contribution shall

    be directed to the Utah Public Education Foundation.

- 3 -


        (5)  The commission may make rules to implement this section.

    or any other amount in excess of $1 to the trust account created in Section 26-18a-4.

        (2)  Any amount designated as a contribution to this trust account shall be deducted from the

    individual's state tax refund and, if a joint return, is a joint contribution.  This option, once exercised,
