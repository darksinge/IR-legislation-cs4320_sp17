Separate taxation.209          (1)  Each unit and its percentage of undivided interest in the common or community210     areas and facilities shall be considered to be a parcel and shall be subject to separate211     assessment and taxation by each assessing unit, local district, and special service district for all212     types of taxes authorized by law, including ad valorem levies and special assessments.

If the owner of the reversion under the lease has224     executed the declaration and condominium plat, until 10 years prior to the date that the225     leasehold is to expire, or until the lease is terminated, whichever first occurs, all taxes and226     assessments on the real property covered by the lease shall be separately levied against the unit227     owners having an interest in the lease, with each unit owner for taxation purposes being228     considered the owner of a parcel consisting of his undivided condominium interest in the fee of229     the real property affected by the lease.230          (3)  No forfeiture or sale of the improvements or the property as a whole for delinquent231     real estate taxes, special assessments, or charges shall divest or in anywise affect the title to an232     individual unit if the real estate taxes or duly levied share of the assessments and charges on the233     individual unit are currently paid.234          (4)  Any exemption from taxes that may exist on real property or the ownership of the235     property may not be denied by virtue of the submission of the property to this chapter.236          (5)  Timeshare interests and timeshare estates, as defined in [Subsection] Section237     57-19-2[(19)], may not be separately taxed but shall be valued, assessed, and taxed at the unit238     level.  The value of timeshare interests and timeshare estates, for purposes of ad valorem239     taxation, shall be determined by valuing the real property interest associated with the timeshare240     interest or timeshare estate, exclusive of the value of any intangible property and rights241     associated with the acquisition, operation, ownership, and use of the timeshare interest or242     timeshare estate, including the fees and costs associated with the sale of timeshare interests and243     timeshare estates that exceed those fees and costs normally incurred in the sale of other similar244     properties, the fees and costs associated with the operation, ownership, and use of timeshare245     interests and timeshare estates, vacation exchange rights, vacation conveniences and services,246     club memberships, and any other intangible rights and benefits available to a timeshare unit247     owner.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the assessment of any real248     property interest associated with a timeshare interest or timeshare estate at less than its fair249     market value.  Notice of assessment, delinquency, sale, or any other purpose required by law is250     considered sufficient for all purposes if the notice is given to the management committee.251          Section 3.  Section 57-19-2 is amended to read:252          57-19-2.
