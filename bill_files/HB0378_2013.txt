    (3)  The counter shall count a defective or incomplete mark on any paper ballot if:

group of ballots show an intent by a person or group to mark their ballots so that their ballots
            
103

    
can be identified.
            
104

    
    (6) (a)  In counting the ballots, the counters shall give full consideration to the intent of
            
105

    
the voter.

108

    
required by Chapter 3.

endorsement by an election officer.
            
114

116

    
    [(9)] (10)  If the counter discovers that the name of a candidate voted for is misspelled
            
117

    
or that the initial letters of a candidate's given name are transposed or omitted in part or
            
118

    
altogether, the counter shall count the voter's vote for that candidate if it is apparent that the
            
119

    
voter intended to vote for that candidate.
            
120

    
    [(10)] (11)  The counter shall count a vote for the president and the vice president of

            
121


    
any political party as a vote for the presidential electors selected by the political party.
            
122

    
    [(11)] (12)  In counting the valid write-in votes, if, by casting a valid write-in vote, a
            
123

    
voter has cast more votes for an office than that voter is entitled to vote for that office, the
            
124

    
judges shall count the valid write-in vote as being the obvious intent of the voter.
            
125

    
    Section 3.

138

    
means; and

146

    
register; and
            
147

    
    (iii) (A)  the county clerk verifies the person's identity and residence through some other

means as reliable as photo identification; or

    (B)  the person provides valid voter identification to the county clerk or an election

    (b)  If the election officer determines that the person is not registered to vote in this
            
161

    
state or is not legally entitled to vote in the county or for any of the ballot propositions or
            
162

    
candidates on the ballot that the person voted, the election officer shall retain the ballot
            
163

    
envelope, unopened, for the period specified in Section 

20A-4-202

 unless ordered by a court to

170

    (4)  If the election officer determines that the person is not registered to vote in this
            
176

    
state and the information on the provisional ballot envelope is complete, the election officer
            
177

    
shall:
            
178

    
    (a)  consider the provisional ballot envelope a voter registration form for the person's
