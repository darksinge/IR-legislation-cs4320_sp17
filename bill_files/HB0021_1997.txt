The department shall not issue a license to any          person to prescribe, dispense, or administer a Schedule I controlled substance.  In determining          public interest, the department shall consider whether or not the applicant has                i   maintained effective controls against diversion of controlled substances and any          Schedule I or II substance compounded from any controlled substance into other than legitimate          medical, scientific, or industrial channels                ii   complied with

the department establishes that promote the         public health and safety.              b   Licenses granted under Subsection     a  do not entitle a licensee to manufacture,         produce, distribute, conduct research with, or perform laboratory analysis upon controlled         substances in Schedule I other than those specified in the license.              c   i   Practitioners shall be licensed to administer, dispense, or conduct research with         substances in Schedules II through V if they are authorized to administer, dispense, or conduct          research under the laws of this state.               ii   The department need not require a separate license for practitioners engaging in          research with nonnarcotic controlled substances in Schedules II through V where the licensee is          already licensed under this act in another capacity.               iii   With respect to research involving narcotic substances in Schedules II through V, or          where the department by rule requires a separate license for research of nonnarcotic substances in          Schedules II through V, a practitioner shall apply to the department prior to conducting research.               iv   Licensing for purposes of bona fide research with controlled substances by a          practitioner considered qualified may be denied only on a ground specified in Subsection    , or          upon evidence that the applicant will abuse or unlawfully transfer or fail to safeguard adequately          his supply of substances against diversion from medical or scientific use.               v   Practitioners registered under federal law to conduct research in Schedule I substances          may conduct research in Schedule I substances within this state upon furnishing the department          evidence of federal registration.               d   Compliance by manufacturers, producers, and distributors with the provisions of          federal law respecting registration, excluding fees, entitles them to be licensed under this chapter.               e   The department shall initially license those persons who own or operate an          establishment engaged in the manufacture, production, distribution, dispensation, or administration          of controlled substances prior to April  ,     , and who are licensed by the state.                   a   Any license pursuant to Subsection     or     may be denied, suspended, placed on          probation, or revoked by the department upon finding that the applicant or licensee has                i

or regulations comparable to those of this state relating to the manufacture,          distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances                vi   violated any department rule that reflects adversely on the licensee s reliability and          integrity with respect to controlled substances                vii   refused inspection of records required to be maintained under this chapter by a person          authorized to inspect them  or               viii   prescribed, dispensed, administered, or injected an anabolic steroid for the purpose          of manipulating human

professional practice  or               B   improve performance in any form of human exercise, sport, or game.               b   The department may limit revocation or suspension of a license to a particular          controlled substance with respect to which grounds for revocation or suspension exist.               c   i   Proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend a license shall be conducted pursuant to          this section and in accordance with the procedures set forth in Title   , Chapter  , Division of          Occupational and Professional Licensing Act, and conducted in conjunction with the appropriate          representative committee designated by the director of the department.               ii   Nothing in this Subsection     c  gives the Division of Occupational and Professional          Licensing exclusive authority in proceedings to deny, revoke, or suspend licenses, except where          the department is designated by law to perform those functions, or, when not designated by law,          is designated by the executive director of the Department of Commerce to conduct the          proceedings.               d   i   The department may suspend any license simultaneously with the institution of                  proceedings under this section if it finds there is an imminent danger to the public health or safety.              ii   Suspension shall continue in effect until the conclusion of proceedings, including         judicial review, unless withdrawn by the department or dissolved by a court of competent         jurisdiction.              e   i   If a license is suspended or revoked under Subsection    , all controlled substances         owned or possessed by the licensee may be placed under seal in the discretion of the department.              ii    No disposition  Disposition may not be made of substances under seal until the time         for taking an appeal has lapsed, or until all appeals have been concluded, unless a court, upon         application, orders the sale of perishable substances and the proceeds deposited with the court.               iii   If a revocation order becomes final, all controlled substances shall be forfeited.               f   The department shall notify promptly the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs          of all orders suspending or revoking a license and all forfeitures of controlled substances.                   a   Persons licensed under Subsection     or     shall maintain records and inventories          in conformance with the record keeping and inventory requirements of

Controlled substances in Schedules I through V may be distributed only by a licensee          and pursuant to an order form prepared in compliance with department rules or a lawful order          under the rules and regulations of the United States.                   a    No  A person may not write or authorize a prescription for a controlled substance          unless he is                i

At the time of arraignment or a later date         when granted by the court, the court shall read the allegation of the previous conviction to the         defendant, provide him or his counsel with a copy of it, and explain to the defendant the         consequences of the allegation under Subsection     a .  The allegation of the past conviction of         the defendant is not admissible in a jury trial, except where the admissibility in evidence of a         previous conviction is otherwise recognized as admissible by law.                ii   The court, following conviction of the defendant of the substantive offense charged         and prior to imposing sentence, shall inform the defendant of its decision to impose a minimum         sentence under Subsection     a  and inquire as to whether the defendant admits or denies the          previous conviction.  If the defendant denies the previous conviction, the court shall afford him          an opportunity to present evidence showing that the allegation of the past conviction is erroneous          or the conviction was lawfully vacated or the defendant was pardoned.  The evidence shall be          made a matter of record.  Following the evidence, the court shall make a finding as to whether the          defendant has a previous conviction, which finding is final, except for a showing of abuse of          discretion.  Following the findings by the court, the defendant shall be sentenced under Subsection              a  or under the appropriate penalty provided by law, as the court in its discretion determines.                 c   Any person sentenced on a second offense to probation who violates that probation          is subject to Subsections     a  and     b .                 d   For violations of this section, Subsection     supersedes Section         . .
