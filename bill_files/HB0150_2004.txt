93

    
receiving workers' compensation benefits under this chapter or Chapter 2, Workers'
            
94

 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-3-04  9:52 AM

This bill creates a class consisting of certain firefighters and medical providers of fire
departments. For this class the bill provides a rebuttable presumption that certain diseases
presumptively arose as a result of working for the fire department and therefore are
compensable under workers' compensation statutes. Under equal protection principles of the
Constitution of the United States and the uniform operation of the laws provisions of the Utah
Constitution, there are limits on a legislature's ability to establish classifications and then treat
members of the classes differently. If the classification does not involve certain protected
classes, courts generally apply a rational basis test when reviewing legislative classifications. 
In addition, because of the exclusive remedy element of workers' compensation, the open
courts provision of the Utah Constitution may be implicated if the remedies provided under
workers' compensation are found inadequate. In examining the permissibility of classes, courts
look to factors such as the relationship between the class and the legislative objective being
pursued. For example, a court may look at the relationship between the creation of the
presumption and the level of exposure fire department employees may experience because of
the nature of their employment.
