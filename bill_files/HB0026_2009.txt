habitual violent offender under this section.  Notice shall include the case number, court, and
            
119

    
date of conviction or commitment of any case relied upon by the prosecution.
            
120

    
    (b) (i)  The defendant shall serve notice in writing upon the prosecutor if the defendant

            
121


    
intends to deny that:
            
122

    
    (A)  the defendant is the person who was convicted or committed;
            
123

    
    (B)  the defendant was represented by counsel or had waived counsel; or
            
124

    
    (C)  the defendant's plea was understandingly or voluntarily entered.
            
125

    
    (ii)  The notice of denial shall be served not later than five days prior to trial and shall
            
126

    
state in detail the defendant's contention regarding the previous conviction and commitment.
            
127

    
    (4) (a)  If the defendant enters a denial under Subsection (3)(b) and if the case is tried to
            
128

    
a jury, the jury may not be told until after it returns its verdict on the underlying felony charge,
            
129

    
of the:
            
130

    
    (i)  defendant's previous convictions for violent felonies, except as otherwise provided
            
131

    
in the Utah Rules of Evidence; or
            
132

    
    (ii)  allegation against the defendant of being a habitual violent offender.
            
133

    
    (b)  If the jury's verdict is guilty, the defendant shall be tried regarding the allegation of
            
134

    
being an habitual violent offender by the same jury, if practicable, unless the defendant waives
            
135

    
the jury, in which case the allegation shall be tried immediately to the court.
            
136

    
    (c) (i)  Prior to or at the time of sentencing the trier of fact shall determine if this section
            
137

    
applies.
            
138

    
    (ii)  The trier of fact shall consider any evidence presented at trial and the prosecution
            
139

    
and the defendant shall be afforded an opportunity to present any necessary additional
            
140

    
evidence.
            
141

    
    (iii)  Prior to sentencing under this section, the trier of fact shall determine whether this
            
142

    
section is applicable beyond a reasonable doubt.
            
143

    
    (d)  If any previous conviction and commitment is based upon a plea of guilty or no
            
144

    
contest, there is a rebuttable presumption that the conviction and commitment were regular and
            
145

    
lawful in all respects if the conviction and commitment occurred after January 1, 1970.  If the
            
146

    
conviction and commitment occurred prior to January 1, 1970, the burden is on the prosecution
            
147

    
to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was then represented by
            
148

    
counsel or had lawfully waived the right to have counsel present, and that the defendant's plea
            
149

    
was understandingly and voluntarily entered.
            
150

    
    (e)  If the trier of fact finds this section applicable, the court shall enter that specific
            
151

    
finding on the record and shall indicate in the order of judgment and commitment that the

            
152


    
defendant has been found by the trier of fact to be a habitual violent offender and is sentenced
            
153

    
under this section.
            
154

    
    (5) (a)  The sentencing enhancement provisions of Section 

76-3-407

 supersede the
            
155

    
provisions of this section.
            
156

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (5)(a), the "violent felony" offense defined in
            
157

    
Subsection (1)(c) shall include any felony sexual offense violation of Title 76, Chapter 5, Part
            
158

    
4, Sexual Offenses, to determine if the convicted person is a habitual violent offender.
            
159

    
    (6)  The sentencing enhancement described in this section does not apply if:
            
160

    
    (a)  the offense for which the person is being sentenced is:
            
161

    
    (i)  a grievous sexual offense;
            
162

    
    (ii)  child kidnapping, Section 

76-5-301.1

;
            
163

    
    (iii)  aggravated kidnapping, Section 

76-5-302

; or
            
164

    
    (iv)  forcible sexual abuse, Section 

76-5-404

; and
            
165

    
    (b)  applying the sentencing enhancement provided for in this section would result in a
            
166

    
lower maximum penalty than the penalty provided for under the section that describes the
            
167
