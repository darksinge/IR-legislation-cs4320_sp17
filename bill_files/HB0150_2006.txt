.
            
600

    
    (d)  The employer or its insurance carrier shall be given credit for any disability

612

    
plan.  The employer's or insurance carrier's failure to diligently pursue the reemployment plan

614

    
make a final decision of permanent total disability.
            
615

620

    
facts and evidence, and ends:
            
621

    
    (i)  with the death of the employee; or
            
622

    
    (ii)  when the employee is capable of returning to regular, steady work.
            
623

    
    (b)  An employer or its insurance carrier may provide or locate for a permanently totally

disabled employee reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work in a job earning at least

minimum wage provided that employment may not be required to the extent that it would
            
626

    
disqualify the employee from Social Security disability benefits.
            
627

    
    (c)  An employee shall fully cooperate in the placement and employment process and
            
628

    
accept the reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work.
            
629

    
    (d)  In a consecutive four-week period when an employee's gross income from the work
            
630

    
provided under Subsection (7)(b) exceeds $500, the employer or insurance carrier may reduce
            
631

    
the employee's permanent total disability compensation by 50% of the employee's income in
            
632

    
excess of $500.
            
633

    
    (e)  If a work opportunity is not provided by the employer or its insurance carrier, a
            
634

    
permanently totally disabled employee may obtain medically appropriate, part-time work
            
635

    
subject to the offset provisions contained in Subsection (7)(d).

641

    
    (h)  The administrative law judge may:
            
642

    
    (i)  excuse an employee from participation in any job that would require the employee
            
643

    
to undertake work exceeding the employee's medical capacity and residual functional capacity
            
644

    
or for good cause; or
            
645

    
    (ii)  allow the employer or its insurance carrier to reduce permanent total disability
            
646

    
benefits as provided in Subsection (7)(d) when reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time
            
647

    
employment has been offered but the employee has failed to fully cooperate.

            
648


    
    (8)  When an employee has been rehabilitated or the employee's rehabilitation is
            
649

    
possible but the employee has some loss of bodily function, the award shall be for permanent
            
650

    
partial disability.
            
651

    
    (9)  As determined by an administrative law judge, an employee is not entitled to
            
652

    
disability compensation, unless the employee fully cooperates with any evaluation or
            
653

    
reemployment plan under this chapter or Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act.  The
            
654

    
administrative law judge shall dismiss without prejudice the claim for benefits of an employee
            
655

    
if the administrative law judge finds that the employee fails to fully cooperate, unless the
            
656

    
administrative law judge states specific findings on the record justifying dismissal with
            
657

    
prejudice.
            
658

    
    (10) (a)  The loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of both hands, both arms,
            
659

and permanent disability, to be compensated according to this section.
            
661

    
    (b)  A finding of permanent total disability pursuant to Subsection (10)(a) is final.
            
662

    
    (11) (a)  An insurer or self-insured employer may periodically reexamine a permanent
            
663

    
total disability claim, except those based on Subsection (10), for which the insurer or
            
664

    
self-insured employer had or has payment responsibility to determine whether the worker
            
665

    
remains permanently totally disabled.
            
666

    
    (b)  Reexamination may be conducted no more than once every three years after an
            
667

    
award is final, unless good cause is shown by the employer or its insurance carrier to allow
            
668

    
more frequent reexaminations.
            
669

    
    (c)  The reexamination may include:

679


    
appropriate employee reimbursement pursuant to rule for reasonable travel allowance and per
            
680

    
diem as well as reasonable expert witness fees incurred by the employee in supporting the
            
681

    
employee's claim for permanent total disability benefits at the time of reexamination.
            
682

    
    (e)  If an employee fails to fully cooperate in the reasonable reexamination of a
            
683

    
permanent total disability finding, an administrative law judge may order the suspension of the
            
684

    
employee's permanent total disability benefits until the employee cooperates with the
            
685

    
reexamination.
            
686

    
    (f) (i)  Should the reexamination of a permanent total disability finding reveal evidence
            
687

    
that reasonably raises the issue of an employee's continued entitlement to permanent total
            
688

    
disability compensation benefits, an insurer or self-insured employer may petition the Division
            
689

    
of Adjudication for a rehearing on that issue.  The petition shall be accompanied by
            
690

    
documentation supporting the insurer's or self-insured employer's belief that the employee is no
            
691

    
longer permanently totally disabled.
            
692

    
    (ii)  If the petition under Subsection (11)(f)(i) demonstrates good cause, as determined
            
693

    
by the Division of Adjudication, an administrative law judge shall adjudicate the issue at a
            
694

    
hearing.
            
695

    
    (iii)  Evidence of an employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time work
            
696

    
may not be the sole basis for termination of an employee's permanent total disability
            
697

    
entitlement, but the evidence of the employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time
            
698

    
work under Subsection (7) may be considered in the reexamination or hearing with other
            
699

    
evidence relating to the employee's status and condition.
            
700

    
    (g)  In accordance with Section 

34A-1-309

, the administrative law judge may award
            
701

702

    
interests with respect to reexamination of the permanent total disability finding, except if the
            
703

    
employee does not prevail, the attorneys fees shall be set at $1,000.  The attorneys fees shall be
            
704

    
paid by the employer or its insurance carrier in addition to the permanent total disability
            
705

    
compensation benefits due.
            
706

    
    (h)  During the period of reexamination or adjudication if the employee fully
            
707

    
cooperates, each insurer, self-insured employer, or the Employers' Reinsurance Fund shall
            
708

    
continue to pay the permanent total disability compensation benefits due the employee.
            
709

    
    (12)  If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision to any person
