A plaintiff who obtains a preliminary injunction or administrative stay in an                          environmental action, but does not ultimately prevail on the merits of the environmental action,                          is liable for damages sustained by any defendant who                                 a   opposed the preliminary injunction or administrative stay  and                                b   was harmed by the preliminary injunction.                                    A court may not issue a preliminary injunction and an agency may not grant an                          administrative stay in an environmental action until the plaintiff posts with the court or the                          agency a surety bond or cash equivalent                                 a   in an amount the court or agency considers sufficient to compensate each defendant                          opposing the preliminary injunction or administrative stay for damages that each defendant                          may sustain as a result of the preliminary injunction or administrative stay                                 b   written by a surety licensed to do business in the state  and                                c   payable to each defendant opposing the preliminary injunction or administrative                          stay in the event the plaintiff does not prevail on the merits of the environmental action.                                    If there is more than one plaintiff, the court or agency shall establish the amount of                          the bond required by Subsection     for each plaintiff in a fair and equitable manner.                                    a   If the plaintiff does not ultimately prevail on the merits of the environmental                          action, the court shall execute the bond and award damages to each defendant who                                    i   opposed the preliminary injunction or administrative stay  and                                ii   was harmed as a result of its issuance.                                b   If the amount of money secured by the surety bond or cash equivalent                                 i   exceeds the damages awarded, the court or agency shall return the excess to the                          plaintiff  and                                ii   is less than the damages awarded, the court or agency shall order the plaintiff to pay                          the remaining damages.                                    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a court s or agency s refusal to require                          the posting of a surety bond or cash equivalent as required by this section is subject to                          immediate appeal.
