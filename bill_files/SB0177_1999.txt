.
            

    
    (b)  Limited liability for equity interest holders is a privilege, not a right, under the law and
            

    
is meant to benefit the state and its citizens.  An organization engaging in subject activities has
            

    
significant potential to affect the health, welfare, or best interests of the state and should not have
            

    
limited liability for its equity interest holders.  To shield equity interest holders from the debts and
            

    
obligations of an organization engaged in subject activities would have the effect of attracting capital
            

    
to enterprises whose goals are contrary to the state's interests.
            

    
    (c)  This section has the intent of revoking any and all statutory and common law grants of

activity in this state.
            

    
    (d)  This section shall be interpreted liberally to allow the greatest possible lawful recourse
            

    
against an equity interest holder of an organization engaged in a subject activity in this state for the
            

    
debts and liabilities of that organization.
            

    
    (e)  This section does not reduce or affect any liability limitation otherwise granted to an

- 3 -

            

    
organization by Utah law if that organization is not engaged in a subject activity in this state.
            

    
    (3)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a domestic or foreign organization engages
            

    
in a subject activity in this state, no equity interest holder of that organization enjoys any shield or
            

    
limitation of liability for the acts, omissions, debts, and obligations of the organization incurred in this
            

    
state.  Each equity interest holder of the organization is strictly and jointly and severally liable for all
            

    
these obligations.
            

    
    (4)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, each officer and director of an organization
            

    
engaged in a subject activity in this state is individually liable for the acts, omissions, debts, and
            

    
obligations of the organization incurred in this state.
            

    
    (5) (a)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a subsidiary organization is engaged in a
            

    
subject activity in this state, then each parent organization of the subsidiary is also considered to be
            

    
engaged in a subject activity in this state.  Each parent organization's equity interest holders and
            

    
officers and directors are subject to this section to the same degree as the subsidiary's equity interest
            

    
holders and officers and directors.
            

    
    (b)  Subsection (5)(a) applies regardless of the number of parent organizations through which
            

    
the controlling interest passes in the relationship between the subsidiary and the ultimate parent
            

    
organization that controls the subsidiary.
            

    
    (6)  This section does not excuse or modify the requirements imposed upon an applicant for
            

    
a license by Subsection

(9).

of such crossings to certain types of traffic in the interest of public safety and is vested with power
            

    
and it shall be its duty to designate the railroad crossings to be traversed by school buses and motor
            

    
vehicles carrying passengers for hire, and to require, where in its judgment it would be practicable,

alteration or abolition of such crossings or the separation of such grades shall be divided between the
            

    
railroad or street railroad corporations affected, or between such corporations and the state, county,
            

    
municipality or other public authority in interest.
            

    
    (3)  Whenever the department shall find that public convenience and necessity demand the
            

    
establishment, creation or construction of a crossing of a street or highway over, under or upon the
            

    
tracks or lines of any public utility, the department may by order, decision, rule or decree require the
            

    
establishment, construction or creation of such crossing, and such crossing shall thereupon become

Section 

19-3-318

, the commission's decision under Subsection (4)(a) regarding resolution of a dispute
