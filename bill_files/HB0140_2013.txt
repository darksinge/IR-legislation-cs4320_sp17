Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

    (1)  The Legislature finds that:
            
34

    
    (a)  current health care delivery and payment systems do not provide system wide
            
35

    
incentives for the competitive delivery and pricing of health care services to consumers;

38

    
    (c)  some health care providers and health care payers have developed
            
39

    
consumer-focused ideas for health care delivery and payment system reform, but lack the
            
40

    
critical number of patient lives and payer involvement to accomplish system-wide
            
41

    
consumer-focused reform; and
            
42

    
    (d)  there is a compelling state interest to encourage as many health care providers and
            
43

    
health care payers to join together and coordinate efforts at consumer-focused health care
            
44

    
delivery and payment reform that would provide to consumers enrolled in a high-deductible
            
45

    
health plan:
            
46

    
    (i)  greater choice in health care options;
            
47

    
    (ii)  improved services through competition; and

    (iii)  more affordable options for care.
            
49

    
    (2) (a)  The insurance department shall convene a meeting of health care providers and
            
50

    
health care payers for the purpose of coordinating a demonstration project for
            
51

    
consumer-focused health care delivery and payment reform.
            
52

    
    (b)  Participation in the coordination efforts by health care providers and health care
            
53

    
payers is voluntary, but encouraged.
            
54

    
    (3)  The commissioner shall facilitate a coordinated demonstration project for
            
55

    
consumer-focused health care delivery reform and consumer-focused health care payment
            
56

    
reform between one or more health care providers and one or more health care payers that elect
            
57

    
to participate in the demonstration project by:
            
58

    
    (a)  consulting with health care providers and health care payers who elect to join

            
59


    
together in a consumer-based reform demonstration project;
            
60

    
    (b)  applying for health care innovation grants and other assistance that may be
            
61

    
available for demonstrating consumer-focused improvements to health care delivery and
            
62

    
payment; and
            
63

    
    (c)  adopting administrative rules in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah
            
64

    
Administrative Rulemaking Act, as necessary, to develop, oversee, and implement the
