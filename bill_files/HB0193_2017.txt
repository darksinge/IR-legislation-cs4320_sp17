If the findings described in Subsection (4)4020     exist, the proceeding shall result in the transfer of physical custody to the appropriate local4021     mental health authority, and the child may be placed in an inpatient or residential setting.4022          (3)  The neutral and detached fact finder who conducts the inquiry:4023          (a)  shall be a designated examiner, as defined in Subsection 62A-15-602(3); and4024          (b)  may not profit, financially or otherwise, from the commitment or physical4025     placement of the child in that setting.4026          (4)  Upon determination by the fact finder that the following circumstances clearly4027     exist, he may order that the child be committed to the physical custody of a local mental health4028     authority:4029          (a)  the child has a mental illness, as defined in Subsection 62A-15-602[(8)](11);4030          (b)  the child demonstrates a risk of harm to himself or others;4031          (c)  the child is experiencing significant impairment in his ability to perform socially;4032          (d)  the child will benefit from care and treatment by the local mental health authority;4033     and4034          (e)  there is no appropriate less-restrictive alternative.4035          (5) (a)  The commitment proceeding before the neutral and detached fact finder shall be4036     conducted in as informal manner as possible, and in a physical setting that is not likely to have4037     a harmful effect on the child.4038          (b)  The child, the child's parent or legal guardian, the person who submitted the4039     petition for commitment, and a representative of the appropriate local mental health authority4040     shall all receive informal notice of the date and time of the proceeding.  Those parties shall also4041     be afforded an opportunity to appear and to address the petition for commitment.4042          (c)  The neutral and detached fact finder may, in his discretion, receive the testimony of4043     any other person.4044          (d)  The fact finder may allow the child to waive his right to be present at the4045     commitment proceeding, for good cause shown.  If that right is waived, the purpose of the4046     waiver shall be made a matter of record at the proceeding.4047          (e)  At the time of the commitment proceeding, the appropriate local mental health4048     authority, its designee, or the psychiatrist who has been in charge of the child's care prior to the4049     commitment proceeding, shall provide the neutral and detached fact finder with the following4050     information, as it relates to the period of current admission:4051          (i)  the petition for commitment;4052          (ii)  the admission notes;4053          (iii)  the child's diagnosis;4054          (iv)  physicians' orders;4055          (v)  progress notes;4056          (vi)  nursing notes; and4057          (vii)  medication records.4058          (f)  The information described in Subsection (5)(e) shall also be provided to the child's4059     parent or legal guardian upon written request.4060          (g) (i)  The neutral and detached fact finder's decision of commitment shall state the4061     duration of the commitment.  Any commitment to the physical custody of a local mental health4062     authority may not exceed 180 days.  Prior to expiration of the commitment, and if further4063     commitment is sought, a hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as the initial4064     commitment proceeding, in accordance with the requirements of this section.4065          (ii)  When a decision for commitment is made, the neutral and detached fact finder shall4066     inform the child and his parent or legal guardian of that decision, and of the reasons for4067     ordering commitment at the conclusion of the hearing, and also in writing.4068          (iii)  The neutral and detached fact finder shall state in writing the basis of his decision,4069     with specific reference to each of the criteria described in Subsection (4), as a matter of record.4070          (6)  Absent the procedures and findings required by this section, a child may be4071     temporarily committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority only in4072     accordance with the emergency procedures described in Subsection 62A-15-629(1) or (2).  A4073     child temporarily committed in accordance with those emergency procedures may be held for a4074     maximum of 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  At the expiration of4075     that time period, the child shall be released unless the procedures and findings required by this4076     section have been satisfied.4077          (7)  A local mental health authority shall have physical custody of each child committed4078     to it under this section.  The parent or legal guardian of a child committed to the physical4079     custody of a local mental health authority under this section, retains legal custody of the child,4080     unless legal custody has been otherwise modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In cases4081     when the Division of Child and Family Services or the Division of Juvenile Justice Services4082     has legal custody of a child, that division shall retain legal custody for purposes of this part.4083          (8)  The cost of caring for and maintaining a child in the physical custody of a local4084     mental health authority shall be assessed to and paid by the child's parents, according to their4085     ability to pay.  For purposes of this section, the Division of Child and Family Services or the4086     Division of Juvenile Justice Services shall be financially responsible, in addition to the child's4087     parents, if the child is in the legal custody of either of those divisions at the time the child is4088     committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority under this section, unless4089     Medicaid regulation or contract provisions specify otherwise.  The Office of Recovery Services4090     shall assist those divisions in collecting the costs assessed pursuant to this section.4091          (9)  Whenever application is made for commitment of a minor to a local mental health4092     authority under any provision of this section by a person other than the child's parent or4093     guardian, the local mental health authority or its designee shall notify the child's parent or4094     guardian.  The parents shall be provided sufficient time to prepare and appear at any scheduled4095     proceeding.4096          (10) (a)  Each child committed pursuant to this section is entitled to an appeal within 304097     days after any order for commitment.  The appeal may be brought on the child's own petition,4098     or that of his parent or legal guardian, to the juvenile court in the district where the child4099     resides or is currently physically located.  With regard to a child in the custody of the Division4100     of Child and Family Services or the Division of Juvenile Justice Services, the attorney general's4101     office shall handle the appeal, otherwise the appropriate county attorney's office is responsible4102     for appeals brought pursuant to this Subsection (10)(a).4103          (b)  Upon receipt of the petition for appeal, the court shall appoint a designated4104     examiner previously unrelated to the case, to conduct an examination of the child in accordance4105     with the criteria described in Subsection (4), and file a written report with the court.  The court4106     shall then conduct an appeal hearing to determine whether the findings described in Subsection4107     (4) exist by clear and convincing evidence.4108          (c)  Prior to the time of the appeal hearing, the appropriate local mental health authority,4109     its designee, or the mental health professional who has been in charge of the child's care prior4110     to commitment, shall provide the court and the designated examiner for the appeal hearing with4111     the following information, as it relates to the period of current admission:4112          (i)  the original petition for commitment;4113          (ii)  admission notes;4114          (iii)  diagnosis;4115          (iv)  physicians' orders;4116          (v)  progress notes;4117          (vi)  nursing notes; and4118          (vii)  medication records.4119          (d)  Both the neutral and detached fact finder and the designated examiner appointed for4120     the appeal hearing shall be provided with an opportunity to review the most current4121     information described in Subsection (10)(c) prior to the appeal hearing.4122          (e)  The child, his parent or legal guardian, the person who submitted the original4123     petition for commitment, and a representative of the appropriate local mental health authority4124     shall be notified by the court of the date and time of the appeal hearing.  Those persons shall be4125     afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing.  In reaching its decision, the court shall review4126     the record and findings of the neutral and detached fact finder, the report of the designated4127     examiner appointed pursuant to Subsection (10)(b), and may, in its discretion, allow or require4128     the testimony of the neutral and detached fact finder, the designated examiner, the child, the4129     child's parent or legal guardian, the person who brought the initial petition for commitment, or4130     any other person whose testimony the court deems relevant.  The court may allow the child to4131     waive his right to appear at the appeal hearing, for good cause shown.  If that waiver is granted,4132     the purpose shall be made a part of the court's record.4133          (11)  Each local mental health authority has an affirmative duty to conduct periodic4134     evaluations of the mental health and treatment progress of every child committed to its physical4135     custody under this section, and to release any child who has sufficiently improved so that the4136     criteria justifying commitment no longer exist.4137          (12) (a)  A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child's4138     current treating mental health professional may release an improved child to a less restrictive4139     environment, as they determine appropriate.  Whenever the local mental health authority or its4140     designee, and the child's current treating mental health professional, determine that the4141     conditions justifying commitment no longer exist, the child shall be discharged and released to4142     his parent or legal guardian.  With regard to a child who is in the physical custody of the State4143     Hospital, the treating psychiatrist or clinical director of the State Hospital shall be the child's4144     current treating mental health professional.4145          (b)  A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child's4146     current treating mental health professional, is authorized to issue a written order for the4147     immediate placement of a child not previously released from an order of commitment into a4148     more restrictive environment, if the local authority or its designee and the child's current4149     treating mental health professional has reason to believe that the less restrictive environment in4150     which the child has been placed is exacerbating his mental illness, or increasing the risk of4151     harm to himself or others.4152          (c)  The written order described in Subsection (12)(b) shall include the reasons for4153     placement in a more restrictive environment and shall authorize any peace officer to take the4154     child into physical custody and transport him to a facility designated by the appropriate local4155     mental health authority in conjunction with the child's current treating mental health4156     professional.  Prior to admission to the more restrictive environment, copies of the order shall4157     be personally delivered to the child, his parent or legal guardian, the administrator of the more4158     restrictive environment, or his designee, and the child's former treatment provider or facility.4159          (d)  If the child has been in a less restrictive environment for more than 30 days and is4160     aggrieved by the change to a more restrictive environment, the child or his representative may4161     request a review within 30 days of the change, by a neutral and detached fact finder as4162     described in Subsection (3).  The fact finder shall determine whether:4163          (i)  the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is exacerbating4164     his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others; or4165          (ii)  the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is not4166     exacerbating his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others, in which4167     case the fact finder shall designate that the child remain in the less restrictive environment.4168          (e)  Nothing in this section prevents a local mental health authority or its designee, in4169     conjunction with the child's current mental health professional, from discharging a child from4170     commitment or from placing a child in an environment that is less restrictive than that4171     designated by the neutral and detached fact finder.4172          (13)  Each local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child's4173     current treating mental health professional shall discharge any child who, in the opinion of that4174     local authority, or its designee, and the child's current treating mental health professional, no4175     longer meets the criteria specified in Subsection (4), except as provided by Section 78A-6-120. 4176     The local authority and the mental health professional shall assure that any further supportive4177     services required to meet the child's needs upon release will be provided.4178          (14)  Even though a child has been committed to the physical custody of a local mental4179     health authority pursuant to this section, the child is still entitled to additional due process4180     proceedings, in accordance with Section 62A-15-704, before any treatment which may affect a4181     constitutionally protected liberty or privacy interest is administered.  Those treatments include,4182     but are not limited to, antipsychotic medication, electroshock therapy, and psychosurgery.4183          Section 35.
