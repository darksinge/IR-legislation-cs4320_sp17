35

    
    (2) (a)  The division's investigation shall include, among other actions necessary to

37

    
    [(a)] (i)  a search for and review of any records of past reports of abuse or neglect

42

    
the requirements of Subsection (7);
            
43

    
    [(c)] (iii)  if their whereabouts are known, an interview with at least one of the child's

45

    
    [(d)] (iv)  an interview with the person who reported the abuse, unless anonymous;
            
46

    
    [(e)] (v)  where possible and appropriate, interviews with other third parties who have

48

    
provider;
            
49

    
    [(f)] (vi)  an unscheduled visit to the child's home, unless:
            
50

    
    (A)  the division has reasonable cause to believe that the reported abuse was committed
            
51

    
by a person who does not:
            
52

    
    [(i)] (I)  live in the child's home; or
            
53

    
    [(ii)] (II)  otherwise have access to the child[; and] in the child's home; or
            
54

    
    (B)  an unscheduled visit is not necessary to obtain evidence for the investigation; and
            
55

    
    [(g)] (vii)  if appropriate and indicated in any case alleging physical injury, sexual
            
56

    
abuse, or failure to meet the child's medical needs, a medical examination.  That examination
            
57

    
shall be obtained no later than 24 hours after the child was placed in protective custody.
            
58

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (2)(a)(iii):

            
59


    
    (i)  even if the whereabouts of both parents are known, the division is not required to
            
60

    
interview a second parent unless the division has reason to believe that the second parent has
            
61

    
substantial, relevant information distinct from the information provided by the first parent; and
            
62

    
    (ii)  all interviews with parents shall be conducted prior to the completion of the
            
63

    
investigation.
            
64

    
    (3)  The division may rely on a written report of a prior interview rather than
            
65

    
conducting an additional interview, if:
            
66

    
    (a)  law enforcement has previously conducted a timely and thorough investigation
            
67

    
regarding the alleged abuse [or], neglect, or dependency and has produced a written report;
            
68

    
    (b)  that investigation included one or more of the interviews required by Subsection
            
69

    
(2); and
            
70

    
    (c)  the division finds that an additional interview is not in the best interest of the child.
            
71

    
    (4) (a)  The division's determination of whether a report is substantiated or
            
72

    
unsubstantiated may be based on the child's statements alone.
            
73

    
    (b)  Inability to identify or locate the perpetrator may not be used by the division as a
            
74

    
basis for determining that a report is unsubstantiated, or for closing the case.
            
75

    
    (c)  The division may not determine a case to be [unsubstantiated] unsupported or
            
76

    
identify a case as [unsubstantiated] unsupported solely because the perpetrator was an
            
77

    
out-of-home perpetrator.
            
78

    
    (d)  Decisions regarding whether a report is [substantiated, unsubstantiated] supported,
            
79

    
unsupported, or without merit shall be based on the facts of the case at the time the report was
            
80

    
made.
            
81

    
    (5)  The division should maintain protective custody of the child if it finds that one or
            
82

    
more of the following conditions exist:
            
83

    
    (a)  the minor has no natural parent, guardian, or responsible relative who is able and
            
84

    
willing to provide safe and appropriate care for the minor;
            
85

    
    (b)  shelter of the minor is a matter of necessity for the protection of the minor and there
            
86

    
are no reasonable means by which the minor can be protected in the minor's home or the home
            
87

    
of a responsible relative;
            
88

    
    (c)  there is substantial evidence that the parent or guardian is likely to flee the
            
89

    
jurisdiction of the court; or

            
90


    
    (d)  the minor has left a previously court ordered placement.
            
91

    
    (6) (a)  Within 24 hours after receipt of a child into protective custody, excluding
            
92

    
weekends and holidays, the division shall convene a child protection team to review the
            
93

    
circumstances regarding removal of the child from the child's home or school[,] and prepare the
            
94

    
testimony and evidence that will be required of the division at the shelter hearing, in
            
95

    
accordance with Section 

78-3a-306

.
            
96

    
    (b)  Members of [that] the team shall include:
            
97

    
    (i)  the caseworker assigned to the case and the caseworker who made the decision to
            
98

    
remove the child;
            
99

    
    (ii)  a representative of the school or school district in which the child attends school;
            
100

    
    (iii)  the peace officer who removed the child from the home;
            
101

    
    (iv)  a representative of the appropriate Children's Justice Center, if one is established
            
102

    
within the county where the child resides;
            
103

    
    (v)  if appropriate, and known to the division, a therapist or counselor who is familiar
            
104

    
with the child's circumstances; and
            
105

    
    (vi)  any other individuals [as] determined [to be] appropriate and necessary by the team
            
106

    
coordinator and chair.
            
107

    
    (c)  At [that] the 24-hour meeting, the division shall have available for review and
            
108

    
consideration[,] the complete child protective services and foster care history of the child and
            
109

    
the child's parents and siblings.
            
110

    
    (7)  After receipt of a child into protective custody and prior to the adjudication hearing,
            
111

    
all investigative interviews with the child that are initiated by the division shall be audio or
            
112

    
video taped, and the child shall be allowed to have a support person of the child's choice
            
113

    
present.  That support person may not be an alleged perpetrator.
            
114

    
    (8)  The division shall cooperate with law enforcement investigations regarding the
            
115

    
alleged perpetrator.
            
116

    
    (9)  The division may not close an investigation solely on the grounds that the division
            
117

    
investigator is unable to locate the child[,] until all reasonable efforts have been made to locate
            
118

    
the child and family members.  Those efforts include:
            
119

    
    (a)  visiting the home at times other than normal work hours;

    (b)  contacting local schools;
