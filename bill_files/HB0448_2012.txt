55

56

    
    (d)  other factors the court considers necessary and relevant.

70

    
    (c)  extended parent-time equal to 1/2 of the summer or off-track time for consecutive
            
71

    
weeks.  The children should be returned to the custodial home no later than seven days before
            
72

    
school begins; however, this week shall be counted when determining the amount of
            
73

    
parent-time to be divided between the parents for the summer or off-track period; and
            
74

    
    (d) one weekend per month, at the option and expense of the noncustodial parent.

    [(6)] (7)  The noncustodial parent's monthly weekend entitlement is subject to the
            
76

    
following restrictions.

    (a)  If the noncustodial parent has not designated a specific weekend for parent-time,
            
78

    
the noncustodial parent shall receive the last weekend of each month unless a holiday assigned
            
79

    
to the custodial parent falls on that particular weekend.  If a holiday assigned to the custodial
            
80

    
parent falls on the last weekend of the month, the noncustodial parent shall be entitled to the
            
81

    
next to the last weekend of the month.
            
82

    
    (b)  If a noncustodial parent's extended parent-time or parent-time over a holiday
            
83

    
extends into or through the first weekend of the next month, that weekend shall be considered

the noncustodial parent's monthly weekend entitlement for that month.
            
85

    
    (c)  If a child is out of school for teacher development days or snow days after the
            
86

    
children begin the school year, or other days not included in the list of holidays in Subsection
            
87

    
[(5)] (6) and those days are contiguous with the noncustodial parent's monthly weekend
            
88

    
parent-time, those days shall be included in the weekend parent-time.
            
89

    
    [(7)] (8)  The custodial parent is entitled to all parent-time not specifically allocated to

            
90


    
the noncustodial parent.
            
91

    
    [(8)] (9)  In the event finances and distance preclude the exercise of minimum
            
92

    
parent-time for the noncustodial parent during the school year, the court should consider
            
93

    
awarding more time for the noncustodial parent during the summer time if it is in the best
            
94

    
interests of the children.
            
95

    
    [(9)] (10)  Upon the motion of any party, the court may order uninterrupted parent-time
            
96

    
with the noncustodial parent for a minimum of 30 days during extended parent-time, unless the
            
97

    
court finds it is not in the best interests of the child.  If the court orders uninterrupted
            
98

    
parent-time during a period not covered by this section, it shall specify in its order which parent
            
99

    
is responsible for the child's travel expenses.
            
100

    
    [(10)] (11)  Unless otherwise ordered by the court the relocating party shall be
            
101

    
responsible for all the child's travel expenses relating to Subsections [(5)] (6)(a) and (b) and 1/2
            
102

    
of the child's travel expenses relating to Subsection [(5)] (6)(c), provided the noncustodial
            
103

    
parent is current on all support obligations.  If the noncustodial parent has been found in
            
104

    
contempt for not being current on all support obligations, the noncustodial parent shall be
            
105

    
responsible for all of the child's travel expenses under Subsection [(5)] (6), unless the court
            
106

    
rules otherwise.  Reimbursement by either responsible party to the other for the child's travel
            
107

    
expenses shall be made within 30 days of receipt of documents detailing those expenses.
            
108

    
    [(11)] (12)  The court may apply this provision to any preexisting decree of divorce.
            
109

    
    [(12)] (13)  Any action under this section may be set for an expedited hearing.
            
110

    
    [(13)] (14)  A parent who fails to comply with the notice of relocation in Subsection (2)
            
111

    
shall be in contempt of the court's order.
