    (b)  individuals should have the clear legal choice to:

preferences about health care options to go into effect only after the individual loses the ability

to make or communicate health care decisions, including decisions about end-of-life care; and

254


    
decision making capacity should be made on the basis of the individual's best interest.
            
255

    
    (2)  In recognition of the dignity and privacy that all individuals are entitled to expect,
            
256

    
and to protect the right of an individual to refuse to be treated without the individual's consent,
            
257

    
the Legislature declares that this state recognizes the right to make binding health care
            
258

    
directives directing health care providers to:
            
259

    
    (a)  provide life sustaining or life supporting medically indicated health care;

 Part II:  My Health Care Wishes (Living Will)

878

    
so long as I can make health care decisions, even if the instructions appear to conflict with
