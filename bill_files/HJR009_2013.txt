12

    
after Justice George Sutherland.
            
13

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
14

    
    This resolution:
            
15

    
    .    urges the members of Utah's congressional delegation to work toward having the
            
16

    
new federal courthouse in Salt Lake City named after Justice George Sutherland;
            
17

    
and
            
18

    
    .    urges the members of Utah's congressional delegation to make this effort in
            
19

    
recognition of Justice Sutherland's lifetime of service as a member of the Utah
            
20

    
Senate, United States House of Representatives, United States Senate, and as the
            
21

    
only Utahn to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and whose example of
            
22

    
humility and integrity in public service is unsurpassed.
            
23

    
 Special Clauses:
            
24

    
    None
            
25

    

            
26

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
27

    
    WHEREAS, a new federal courthouse is currently being constructed at 351 South West

            
28


    
Temple in Salt Lake City;
            
29

    
    WHEREAS, if this new structure is to bear the name of an exemplary Utahn, it should
            
30

    
be named after Justice George Sutherland, the only Utahn to serve on the United States
            
31

    
Supreme Court;
            
32

    
    WHEREAS, to date, Justice Sutherland is Utah's most accomplished attorney, public
            
33

    
servant, and judge;
            
34

    
    WHEREAS, before joining the United States Supreme Court, Sutherland was a
            
35

    
renowned legal scholar and sage politician, having served in the Utah State Senate, the United
            
36

    
States House of Representatives, and the United States Senate;
            
37

    
    WHEREAS, no past or present Utahn has done more for his state or country, or
            
38

    
accomplished more as a lawyer;
            
39

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland was born in England in 1862 to converts to the Church of
            
40

    
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS);
            
41

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland's family immigrated to Utah as part of an oxcart company in
            
42

    
October 1863;
            
43

    
    WHEREAS, the Sutherland family first settled in Springville, Utah, and then moved to
            
44

    
Tintic, Utah, where George Sutherland, Sr. sold dry goods to miners;
            
45

    
    WHEREAS, George Sutherland, Sr. left the LDS Church in 1870, and young George
            
46

    
was never baptized;
            
47

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland recalled his boyhood as a "period when life was very simple,
            
48

    
but, as I can bear testimony, very hard as measured by present day standards.Nobody worried
            
49

    
about child labor, the average boy of 10 worked--and often worked very hard";
            
50

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland grew up in a time when everybody was poor and everybody
            
51

    
worked;
            
52

    
    WHEREAS, neither the 8-hour day nor the 40-hour week had arrived, so work began
            
53

    
when it was light enough to see and ended when it became too dark;
            
54

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland worked first in a clothing store in Salt Lake City, then as a
            
55

    
Wells Fargo agent and later as a mining recording agent until age 17, when his family moved to
            
56

    
Provo;
            
57

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland had no schooling from ages 12 to 17, but because he was
            
58

    
taught well by his parents, he entered the Brigham Young Academy in 1879 as an excellent

            
59


    
student and writer;
            
60

    
    WHEREAS, at Brigham Young Academy, he flourished under the tutelage of renowned
            
61

    
headmaster Karl Maeser, who nurtured the institution for decades;
            
62

    
    WHEREAS, at Brigham Young Academy, George Sutherland made many lifelong
            
63

    
friends, nearly all members of the LDS Church, including Sam Thurman, who later became his
            
64

    
law partner, cofounder of the predecessor firm to Snow, Christensen & Martineau, and a Utah
            
65

    
Supreme Court Chief Justice; William H. King, his future law partner and political opponent
            
66

    
against whom he ran for Congress in 1900 and the United States Senate in 1916; and James E.
            
67

    
Talmage and Richard Lyman, future Apostles of the LDS Church;
            
68

    
    WHEREAS, at Brigham Young Academy, he met Rosamond Lee of Beaver, Utah, and
            
69

    
several years later they married;
            
70

    
    WHEREAS, George and Rosamond Sutherland were together for nearly 60 years and
            
71

    
had three children, a boy who died at 17 and two daughters who survived him;
            
72

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland graduated from Brigham Young Academy in 1881 and
            
73

    
attended the University of Michigan Law School for a year, passed the Michigan Bar, and then
            
74

    
married Rosamond and moved to Provo, where he started a practice with his father, by then a
            
75

    
self-taught lawyer;
            
76

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland once stated, "I transacted all kinds of business, both civil and
            
77

    
criminal.  A lawyer in a small town can't pick and choose--public opinion demands that he
            
78

    
shall treat all men alike when they call for his services.  I often traveled on horseback in the
            
79

    
mountains to try cases before Justices of the Peace";
            
80

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland earned a well-deserved reputation as a hardworking and honest
            
81

    
family man who was smart, empathetic, and kind;
            
82

    
    WHEREAS, in 1886, at age 24, his law partnership with Sam Thurman began, and they
            
83

    
were joined by William King two years later;
            
84

    
    WHEREAS, as young lawyers, Sutherland and Thurman defended nine Irish miners
            
85

    
accused of lynching, a capital offense; all were tried and convicted but none was executed--a
            
86

    
victory for Sutherland and Thurman;
            
87

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland also represented many members of the LDS Church charged
            
88

    
with violating the Federal Edmund's Act outlawing polygamy;
            
89

    
    WHEREAS, through these cases and his general character, he earned respect within the

            
90


    
LDS community and at the same time received the political support of the non-LDS
            
91

    
community.
            
92

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland did not represent Karl Maeser when he was convicted in 1887
            
93

    
of violating the Edmund's Act, but he nonetheless appeared at Maeser's sentencing and made an
            
94

    
impassioned and successful plea to the Court not to jail Maeser, citing his many
            
95

    
accomplishments at Brigham Young Academy;
            
96

    
    WHEREAS, the Court did not sentence Maeser to jail, but fined him $300, which
            
97

    
Sutherland immediately paid to the Court;
            
98

    
    WHEREAS, as a young lawyer, Sutherland dove into public service and politics;
            
99

    
    WHEREAS, from 1886 to 1890, Sutherland was an Overseer of the State Hospital in
            
100

    
Provo, and in 1890 he ran for Mayor of Provo as a Liberal Party candidate on an antipolygamy
            
101

    
platform, and lost;
            
102

    
    WHEREAS, LDS-Church sanctioned polygamy ended in late 1890, gutting the Liberal
            
103

    
Party of its purpose, so Sutherland became a Republican and narrowly lost the 1892
            
104

    
Republican nomination for Congress;
            
105

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland was gratified that Utah's new Constitution provided for
            
106

    
women's suffrage, a cause for which he campaigned throughout his political career;
            
107

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland's legal practice blossomed, and in 1894 he left Thurman &
            
108

    
Sutherland and moved to Salt Lake City where he joined the predecessor to the Van Cott law
            
109

    
firm;
            
110

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland helped form the Utah Bar Association in 1895, and in 1896
            
111

    
was elected to the first Utah State Senate, where he chaired the Judiciary Committee, which
            
112

    
drafted the first Utah Judicial and Penal Codes;
            
113

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland proposed the state's first State Workers' Compensation Statute
            
114

    
and laws granting eminent domain to miners and those working in irrigation;
            
115

    
    WHEREAS, in 1900, Sutherland narrowly defeated Democrat and former law partner
            
116

    
William H. King for Utah's lone seat in the United States House of Representatives;
            
117

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland remained very active in state and national Republican Party
            
118

    
affairs, serving as a party delegate from Utah to every Republican convention between 1900
            
119

    
and 1916;
            
120

    
    WHEREAS, in his only House term, Sutherland was instrumental in passing the

            
121


    
Reclamation Act, which allowed Western water projects to be engineered and financed with
            
122

    
federal money, allowing the Western States to grow much faster than if water projects had been
            
123

    
left to private and state financing;
            
124

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland chose not to run for a second term and resumed his practice
            
125

    
with Van Cott;
            
126

    
    WHEREAS, in 1905, United States Senators were elected by State Legislatures;
            
127

    
    WHEREAS, years earlier, Sutherland had represented United States Senator Reed
            
128

    
Smoot's father in a polygamy case and now, with the endorsement of his friend and Senator,
            
129

    
Sutherland prevailed in an interparty fight with incumbent Thomas Kearns;
            
130

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland's two-term Senate career was stellar;
            
131

    
    WHEREAS, through his legal ability, affability, and hard work, Sutherland
            
132

    
accomplished much regarding women's suffrage, workers' compensation, reclamation, Indian
            
133

    
affairs, and foreign policy;
            
134

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland was the driving force behind the Federal Employer Liability
            
135

    
Act, which created a workers' compensation system;
            
136

    
    WHEREAS, in support of the new system, Sutherland argued, "When we are able to get
            
137

    
to the truth as to how these accidents happen we will be able to apply the remedy with greater
            
138

    
certainty, so that the law is not only just in providing compensation to all injured employees,
            
139

    
one of the legitimate expenses of the industry, but what is perhaps still more important, it will
            
140

    
tend to greatly reduce the number of accidents and consequently the aggregate of human
            
141

    
suffering";
            
142

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland championed many other labor causes, earning him the praise of
            
143

    
Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor;
            
144

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland's Judiciary Committee rewrote the United States Criminal and
            
145

    
Judicial codes, "a monumental task" according to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the
            
146

    
United States Supreme Court;
            
147

    
    WHEREAS, in 1907, Sutherland's courtroom skills were well displayed in the Senate
            
148

    
where he mounted a detailed and successful defense of Senator Reed Smoot when the Senate
            
149

    
considered expelling Smoot due to his religious and alleged polygamous practices;
            
150

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland sponsored the Nineteenth Amendment to give women the right
            
151

    
to vote in 1915 and exerted every effort to assure its passage;

            
152


    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland gave several well received speeches promoting the
            
153

    
amendment, including a 1914 speech in which he stated, "I give my assent to woman suffrage
            
154

    
because, as the matter appeals to me, there is no justification for denying to half our citizens the
            
155

    
right to participate in the operations of a government which is as much their government as it is
            
156

    
ours upon the sole ground that they happen to be born women instead of men";
            
157

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland was not a pacifist, and contended that security should be won
            
158

    
through vigilance and strength;
            
159

    
    WHEREAS, when Germany's new submarine fleet attacked shipping in the open sea,
            
160

    
President Wilson's apparent vacillation in 1915 gave rise to sharp criticism from Sutherland in
            
161

    
the Senate, where he stated, ".my own view of the matter is that the new weapon [the
            
162

    
submarine] must yield to the law not that the law must yield to the new weapon.I for one am
            
163

    
becoming sick and tired of the spineless policy of retreat and scuttle.Instead of warning our
            
164

    
own people to exercise their rights at their peril I would like to see issued to other people a
            
165

    
warning to interfere with these rights at their peril.  The danger of it all is that by this policy of
            
166

    
always backing down, instead of backing up, we shall encourage an increased encroachment
            
167

    
upon our rights until we shall finally be driven into crises from which nothing but war can
            
168

    
extricate us";
            
169

    
    WHEREAS, during his Senate years, Sutherland was frequently engaged as a speaker
            
170

    
on many public issues and he gained a strong reputation as a constitutional scholar;
            
171

    
    WHEREAS, this reputation was enhanced by the fact that he argued three cases before
            
172

    
the United States Supreme Court while serving in the Senate;
            
173

    
    WHEREAS, in 1915, Sutherland supported the Seventeenth Amendment, which
            
174

    
provided for popular election of United States Senators;
            
175

    
    WHEREAS, in 1916, Sutherland ran for a third term against his old law partner and
            
176

    
friend, William King, and lost;
            
177

    
    WHEREAS, although Sutherland had not run a statewide campaign for 16 years, his
            
178

    
loss was likely due to the coattail effect of the antiwar fervor that propelled President Wilson to
            
179

    
a second term, on the mantra that "He kept us out of war";
            
180

    
    WHEREAS, many Republican candidates were badly defeated in 1916, but in his
            
181

    
consoling words to William Howard Taft on his loss of the presidential race, Sutherland stated,
            
182

    
"We are to pass through a period of readjustment, and the present administration, in view of its

            
183


    
past history, is not likely to deal with the serious problems which will arise in such a way as to
            
184

    
satisfy the country.  The result will be, therefore, that we shall come back into power for a long
            
185

    
time";
            
186

    
    WHEREAS, the Republicans won the next three presidential elections;
            
187

    
    WHEREAS, after leaving the Senate, Sutherland practiced law in Washington, D.C.
            
188

    
and argued four cases before the United States Supreme Court;
            
189

    
    WHEREAS, in 1917, Sutherland was elected President of the American Bar
            
190

    
Association and gave a series of six lectures at Columbia University Law School on the
            
191

    
Constitution and foreign affairs;
            
192

    
    WHEREAS, always a keen political strategist, Sutherland supported Warren G.
            
193

    
Harding's seemingly unlikely but successful bid for the Republican presidential nomination,
            
194

    
and after Harding was elected he appointed Sutherland as lead counsel for the United States in
            
195

    
a seven week trial at The Hague;
            
196

    
    WHEREAS, Sutherland was also counsel to the United States Delegation to the
            
197

    
Armament talks of 1921;
            
198

    
    WHEREAS, on September 5, 1922, President Harding nominated Sutherland for an
            
199

    
open seat on the United States Supreme Court and the Senate unanimously confirmed him the
            
200

    
same day;
            
201

    
    WHEREAS, there was great public interest in and support for Sutherland's appointment
            
202

    
because he was the first Utahn to be appointed, one of the few Senators to ascend to the bench,
            
203

    
only the fourth foreign born Justice to serve on the Court, and the first to do so since 1793;
            
204

    
    WHEREAS, as he had throughout every aspect of his life, Justice Sutherland worked
            
205

    
very hard on the United States Supreme Court;
            
206

    
    WHEREAS, in 15 years he wrote 295 majority opinions, 35 dissents, and 1
            
207

    
concurrence--an average of 20 majority opinions per year, which is double the average
            
208

    
production of today's Supreme Court Justices;
            
209

    
    WHEREAS, Justice Sutherland's broad life experiences, sobriety, hard work, and
            
210

    
self-reliance brought a valuable perspective to the Court;
            
211

    
    WHEREAS, Justice Sutherland's impoverished upbringing and boyhood years filled
            
212

    
with extremely hard work, combined with his intellect and ambition, propelled him into the
            
213

    
highest echelon of power on the state and national levels, exposing him to people from all

            
214


    
walks of life;
            
215

    
    WHEREAS, Justice Sutherland's extensive experience in the state and national
            
216

    
legislative branches gave him a solid foundation as a constitutional scholar and an expert in
            
217

    
governmental affairs;
            
218

    
    WHEREAS, having seen temporary factions spring to life from time to time, claiming
            
219

    
to have all the answers to society's challenges only to fade away and leave in their wake
            
220

    
ill-considered legislation that often infringed on individual rights or violated other
            
221

    
constitutional principles, Justice Sutherland was wary of the tyranny of the majority;
            
222

    
    WHEREAS, Justice Sutherland challenged the Congress, the President, and other
            
223

    
courts in order to protect individual rights or fundamental constitutional doctrines;
            
224

    
    WHEREAS, in 1935, in Berger v. United States, wherein an Assistant U.S. Attorney
            
225

    
was guilty of gross misconduct during a criminal trial, Justice Sutherland eloquently set the
            
226

    
standard for prosecutorial misconduct when he wrote that the misconduct called for a stern
            
227

    
rebuke and repressive measures, stating, "The United States Attorney is the representative not
            
228

    
of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern
            
229

    
impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a
            
230

    
criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.  As such, he is
            
231

    
in peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold name of which is that
            
232

    
guilt shall not escape, or innocents suffer.  He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor,
            
233

    
indeed he should do so.  But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul
            
234

    
ones.  It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful
            
235

    
conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one";
            
236

    
    WHEREAS, this decision better clarified the prosecutor's role and obligations and gave
            
237

    
trial judges a clear directive and authority to punish prosecutorial misconduct;
            
238

    
    WHEREAS, when Franklin D. Roosevelt overwhelmingly defeated President Hoover in
            
239

    
1932, the Congress quickly passed many acts to address the economic calamity, but the laws
            
240

    
were not thoroughly assessed from a constitutional point of view before they were passed;
            
241

    
    WHEREAS, this led to scores of court challenges, and many laws were struck down by
            
242

    
unanimous vote in 1934, 1935, and 1936, while others were struck down by close votes on
            
243

    
various constitutional grounds;
            
244

    
    WHEREAS, the most controversial opinions that Justice Sutherland wrote struck down

            
245


    
portions of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal legislation;
            
246

    
    WHEREAS, after his landslide 1936 reelection, Roosevelt proposed adding six Justices
            
247

    
to the United States Supreme Court, which Justice Sutherland saw as a roadblock to economic
            
248

    
recovery;
            
249

    
    WHEREAS, the political upheaval that the court-packing plan sparked caused
            
250

    
conservative Justice Owen Roberts to change his votes and to uphold the New Deal legislation;
            
251

    
    WHEREAS, this switch of a vote and strong public opposition to court-packing led to
            
252

    
its defeat in the Senate and avoided a constitutional, and perhaps a national, crisis;
            
253

    
    WHEREAS, Justice Sutherland was bitterly disappointed with Justice Roberts's vote
            
254

    
change, and when the Supreme Court then reversed recent Supreme Court decisions,
            
255

    
Sutherland dissented sharply, contending that political expediency had trumped constitutional
            
256

    
principles;
            
257

    
    WHEREAS, much to the disappointment of moderates and conservatives, Justice
            
258

    
Sutherland retired in 1938;
            
259

    
    WHEREAS, humble to the end, Sutherland did not mention the Supreme Court or his
            
260

    
career in his last public address, the Convocation of the BYU Class of 1941, but instead
            
261

    
reminisced about Utah in the 1860s and 70s, his daylong labors as a child, and his education at
            
262

    
his beloved Brigham Young Academy;
            
263

    
    WHEREAS, above all he implored graduates to be vigilant caretakers of their character,
            
264

    
then to focus on career, family, and church;
            
265

    
    WHEREAS, George Sutherland passed away in 1942;
            
266

    
    WHEREAS, this nation's heritage and good sense teach us to honor distinguished and
            
267

    
exemplary forefathers; and
            
268

    
    WHEREAS, other public servants may deserve the recognition of having their names
            
269

    
on the new federal courthouse, but none deserves it more than George Sutherland:
            
270

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah urge
            
271

    
the members of Utah's congressional delegation to work to have the new federal courthouse in
            
272

    
Salt Lake City named after Justice George Sutherland.
            
273

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature urge the members of Utah's
            
274

    
congressional delegation to make this effort in recognition of Justice Sutherland's lifetime of
            
275

    
service to the citizens of the state of Utah as a member of the Utah Senate and to the United

            
276


    
States as a member of the United States House of Representatives, a member of the United
            
277

    
States Senate, and the only Utahn to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and whose
            
278

    
example of humility and integrity in public service is unsurpassed.
            
279

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the members of
            
280

    
Utah's congressional delegation.
