    (9)  The failure of an owner of property within the assessment area to appear before the
            
573

    
board of equalization to object to the levy of the assessment constitutes a waiver of all
            
574

    
objections to the levy, except an objection that the governing body failed to obtain jurisdiction
            
575

    
to order that the improvements which the assessment is intended to pay be provided to the
            
576

    
assessment area.

630

    
    (1) (a)  Each local entity that levies an assessment under this chapter shall levy the
            
631

    
assessment on each block, lot, tract, or parcel of property that [borders, is adjacent to, or]
            
632

    
benefits from an improvement:
            
633

    
    (i)  to the extent that the improvement directly [or indirectly] benefits the property; and
            
634

    
    (ii)  to whatever depth on the parcel of property that the governing body determines,
            
635

    
including the full depth.
            
636

    
    (b)  The validity of an otherwise valid assessment is not affected by the fact that the
            
637

    
benefit to the property from the improvement[:] does not increase the fair market value of the
            
638

    
property.
            
639

    
    [(i)  is only indirect; or]

641

    
    (2)  [The] Subject to Section 

11-42-406


, the assessment method a governing body uses
            
642

    
to calculate an assessment may be according to frontage, area, taxable value, fair market value,
            
643

    
lot, number of connections, equivalent residential unit, or any combination of these methods, as
            
644

    
the governing body considers fair and equitable.
            
645

    
    (3)  In calculating assessments, a governing body may:
            
646

    
    (a)  use different methods for different improvements in an assessment area; and
            
647

    
    (b)  assess different amounts in different zones, even when using the same method, if

            
648


    
acquisition or construction costs differ from zone to zone.
            
649

    
    (4) (a)  Each local entity shall make an allowance for each corner lot receiving the same
            
650

    
improvement on both sides so that the property is not assessed at the full rate on both sides.
            
651

    
    (b)  A local entity may allocate a corner lot allowance under Subsection (4)(a) to all
            
652

    
other benefitted property within the assessment area by increasing the assessment levied
            
653

    
against the other property.
            
654

    
    (5) (a)  Assessments shall be fair and equitable according to the benefit to the benefitted
            
655

    
property from the improvement.
            
656

    
    (b)  To comply with Subsection (5)(a), a local entity may levy assessments within
            
657

    
zones.
            
658

    
    (6)  A local entity may levy an assessment that would otherwise violate a provision of
            
659

    
this chapter if the owners of all property to be assessed enter into a written agreement with the
            
660

    
local entity consenting to the assessment.
