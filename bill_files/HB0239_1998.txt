26    to the case; and

27        (f)  the attorney from the attorney general's office who is representing the division.

28        (5) (a)  At the shelter hearing, the court shall provide an opportunity for the minor's parent

29    or guardian, if present, and any other person having relevant knowledge, to provide relevant

30    testimony.  The court may also provide an opportunity for the minor to testify.

31        (b)  The court may consider all relevant evidence, in accordance with the Utah Rules of

- 26 -


1    Juvenile Procedure.  The court shall hear relevant evidence presented by the minor, his parent or

2    guardian, the requesting party, or their counsel, but may in its discretion limit testimony and

3    evidence to only that which goes to the issues of removal and the child's need for continued

4    protection.

5        (6)  If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to the

6    court:

7        (a)  the reasons why the minor was removed from the parent's or guardian's custody;

8        (b)  any services provided to the child and his family in an effort to prevent removal;

9        (c)  the need, if any, for continued shelter;

10        (d)  the available services that could facilitate the return of the minor to the custody of his

11    parent or guardian; and

12        (e)  whether the child has any relatives who may be able and willing to take temporary

13    custody.

14        (7)  If necessary to protect the child, preserve the rights of a party, or for other good cause

15    shown, the court may grant no more than one time-limited continuance, not to exceed five judicial

16    days.

17        (8)  The court shall order that the minor be released from the protective custody of the

18    division unless it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist:

19        (a)  there is a substantial danger to the physical health or safety of the minor and the

20    minor's physical health or safety may not be protected without removing him from his parent's

21    custody.  If a minor has previously been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent and a

22    subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie

23    evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the custody of his parent;

24        (b)  the minor is suffering emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but is not limited to,

25    extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward self or others,

26    and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor's emotional health may be

27    protected without removing the minor from the custody of his parent;

28        (c)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been physically or

29    sexually abused, or is deemed to be at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused, by

30    a parent, a member of the parent's household, or other person known to the parent.  If a parent has

31    received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred,

- 27 -


1    and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the

2    alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of

3    being physically or sexually abused;

4        (d)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;

5        (e)  the minor has been left without any provision for his support;

6        (f)  a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for

7    safe and appropriate care for the minor;

8        (g)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the parent is

9    unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the parent are

10    unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful;

11        (h)  the minor is in immediate need of medical care;

12        (i)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to

13    the child's health or safety;

14        (j)  the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been [severely]

15    neglected; or

16        (k)  the child's welfare is otherwise endangered.

17        (9)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether reasonable

18    efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his home and

19    whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued removal.  If the

20    court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or guardian through

21    the provision of those services, it shall place the minor with his parent or guardian and order that

22    those services be provided by the division.

23        (10)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an emergency

24    situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, even with reasonable services being

25    provided, the court shall make a finding that any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was

26    reasonable.

27        (11)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or

28    neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to maintain a child in his

29    home, return a child to his home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the

30    offending parent or parents.  The court may, however, determine that those services or efforts

31    would be reasonable in specific circumstances, and order the division to provide those services.

- 28 -


1        (12)  The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of

2    educational neglect as described in Subsection 78-3a-103(1)(q)(ii).

3        (13) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it shall

4    state the facts on which that decision is based.

5        (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall state

6    the facts on which that decision is based.

7        (14)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody is necessary for the

8    protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned home, it shall order

9    continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child, or the failure of a

10    party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title

11    62A, Chapter 4a, Family Services.

12        Section 16.  Section  78-3a-307 is amended to read:

13         78-3a-307.  Shelter hearing -- Placement with a noncustodial parent or relative --

14     DCFS custody.

15        (1) (a) At the shelter hearing, when the court orders that a child be removed from the

16    custody of his parent in accordance with the requirements of Section 78-3a-306, the court shall

17    first determine whether [there is] reasonable efforts have been made to identify or locate and

18    provide notice to another natural parent as defined in Subsection (b), with whom the child was not

19    residing at the time the events or conditions that brought him within the court's jurisdiction

20    occurred, who desires to assume custody of the child.  If that parent requests custody, the court

21    shall place the minor with that parent unless it finds that the placement would be unsafe or

22    otherwise detrimental to the child.  [The provisions of this Subsection (1) are limited by the

23    provisions of Subsection (8)(b).]  Any preferential consideration for custody that may be granted

24    to a natural parent pursuant to this subsection expires 30 days from the date of the shelter hearing. 

25    After that time the court shall base its custody decision solely on the best interest of the child.

26        (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 78-3a-103, for purposes of this section

27    "natural parent" includes only a biological or adoptive parent [whose consent for adoption would

28    be required pursuant to Section 78-30-4.14] who was married to the child's biological mother at

29    the time the child was conceived or born, or who has strictly complied with the provisions of

30    Section 78-30-4.14 prior to removal of the child or voluntary surrender of the child by the

31    custodial parent.  This definition applies regardless of whether the child has been or will be placed

- 29 -


1    with adoptive parents or whether adoption has been or will be considered as a long term goal for

2    the child.

3        (c) (i)  The court shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that parent to assume

4    custody, and the safety and appropriateness of the placement.

5        (ii)  The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to visit the parent's home, perform

6    criminal background checks described in Sections 78-3a-307.1 and 62A-4a-202.4, and check the

7    division's management information system for any previous reports of abuse or neglect received

8    by the division regarding the parent at issue.

9        (iii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any further

10    investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.

11        (iv)  The division shall report its findings in writing to the court.

12        (v)  The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending its

13    determination regarding that placement.

14        (2)  If the court orders placement with a parent under Subsection (1), the child and the

15    parent are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may order that the parent

16    assume custody subject to the supervision of the court, and order that services be provided to the

17    parent from whose custody the child was removed, the parent who has assumed custody, or both. 

18    The court may also provide for reasonable visitation with the parent from whose custody the child

19    was removed, if that is in the best interest of the child.  The court's order shall be periodically

20    reviewed to determine whether:

21        (a)  placement with the parent continues to be in the child's best interest;

22        (b)  the child should be returned to the original custodial parent;

23        (c)  the child should be placed with a relative, pursuant to Subsection (5); or

24        (d)  the child should be placed in the custody of the division.

25        (3)  The time limitations described in Section 78-3a-311 with regard to reunification

26    efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with

27    Subsection (1).

28        (4)  Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection (1) or

29    (2).  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition that

30    court for modification of the order.

31        (5) (a)  If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of his

- 30 -


1    parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at that time, attempt to

2    determine whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child.  The court may

3    order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a reasonable search to determine

4    whether there are relatives of the child who are willing and appropriate, in accordance with the

5    requirements of this part and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Part 2, Child Welfare Services, for placement

6    of the child.  The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the division pending that

7    determination.  This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an identified relative will

8    receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration may be given to a relative's

9    request for placement of the child, if it is in the best interest of the child, and the provisions of this

10    section are satisfied.

11        (b) (i)  If a willing relative is identified pursuant to Subsection (5)(a), the court shall make

12    a specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative to assume custody, and the safety and

13    appropriateness of placement with that relative.  In order to be considered a "willing relative"

14    under this section, the relative shall be willing to cooperate if the child's permanency goal is

15    reunification with his parent or parents, and be willing to adopt or take permanent custody of the

16    child if that is determined to be in the best interest of the child.

17        (ii)  The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to conduct criminal background

18    checks described in Sections 78-3a-307.1 and 62A-4a-202.4, visit the relative's home, check the

19    division's management information system for any previous reports of abuse or neglect regarding

20    the relative at issue, report its findings in writing to the court, and provide sufficient information

21    so that the court may determine whether:

22        (A)  the relative has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other children that

23    may indicate or present a danger to this child;

24        (B)  the child is comfortable with the relative;

25        (C)  the relative recognizes the parent's history of abuse and is determined to protect the

26    child;

27        (D)  the relative is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent for access

28    to the child, in accordance with court orders;

29        (E)  the relative is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary; and

30        (F)  the relative can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.

31        (iii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any further

- 31 -


1    investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.

2        (c)  The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the

3    division's investigation pursuant to Subsection (b), and the court's determination regarding that

4    placement.  The court shall ultimately base its determination regarding placement with a relative

5    on the best interest of the child.

6        (d)  For purposes of this section, "relative" means an adult who is a grandparent, aunt,

7    uncle, or sibling of the child.

8        (e)  Any preferential consideration that a relative may be initially granted pursuant to this

9    subsection expires 30 days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that time period has expired,

10    a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in the child may not be granted

11    preferential consideration by the division or the court.

12        (6) (a)  When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative pursuant to

13    Subsection (5), it shall order that the relative assume custody subject to the continuing supervision

14    of the court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided to the minor and the relative. 

15    That [placement] child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the Division of Child and

16    Family Services.  The child and any relative with whom the child is placed are under the

17    continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may enter any order that it considers necessary for

18    the protection and best interest of the child.

19        (b) (i)  Placement with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5) shall be periodically reviewed

20    by the court, no less often than every six months, to determine whether:

21        [(a)] (A)  placement with the relative continues to be in the child's best interest;

22        [(b)] (B)  the child should be returned home; or

23        [(c)] (C)  the child should be placed in the custody of the division.

24        [(7) (a)  When the court vests custody of a child with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5),

25    the child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the Division of Child and Family

26    Services.  The child and any relative with whom the child is placed, are under the continuing

27    jurisdiction of the court.  The court may enter any order that it considers necessary for the

28    protection and best interest of the child.]

29        (ii)  No later than 12 months after placement with a relative the court shall schedule a

30    hearing for the purpose of entering a permanent order in accordance with the best interest of the

31    child.

- 32 -


1        (iii)  The time limitations described in Section 78-3a-311, with regard to reunification

2    efforts, apply to children placed with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5).

3        [(b)] (7)  When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of his parent and

4    does not vest custody in another parent or relative under this section, the court shall order that the

5    child be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, to proceed

6    to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services in accordance with this

7    chapter and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.

8        [(8) (a)  Any preferential consideration that a relative may be initially granted pursuant to

9    Subsection (5) expires 30 days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that time period has

10    expired, a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a child, may not be

11    granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.]

12        [(b)  When a period of 30 days from the date of the shelter hearing has expired, the

13    preferential consideration which may initially be granted to a natural parent in accordance with

14    Subsection (1), is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best

15    interest of the child.  The court shall take into consideration:]

16        [(i)  the extent of the natural parent's relationship with the child;]

17        [(ii)  whether the natural parent had actual knowledge of the child's removal from the other

18    parent's custody;]

19        [(iii)  whether, in the past, the natural parent has participated in raising the child by taking

20    responsibility for the child, maintaining a relationship with the child, and financially supporting

21    the child in accordance with the parent's abilities; and]

22        [(iv)  the nature and extent of the child's relationships and well-being in his current

23    placement.]

24        Section 17.  Section  78-3a-312 is amended to read:

25         78-3a-312.  Permanency hearing -- Final plan -- Petition for termination of parental

26     rights filed -- Hearing on termination of parental rights.

27        (1)  [A] When reunification services have been ordered in accordance with Section

28    78-3a-311, with regard to a child who is in the custody of the Division of Child and Family

29    Services, a permanency hearing shall be held by the court no later than 12 months after the original

30    removal of the child.

31        (2) (a)  [If reunification services were ordered by the court in accordance with Section

- 33 -


1    78-3a-311,] At that hearing the court shall determine whether the child may safely be returned to

2    the custody of his parent.  If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that return of the

3    child would create a substantial risk of detriment to the child's physical or emotional well-being,

4    the child may not be returned to the custody of his parent.  The failure of a parent or guardian to

5    participate in, comply with, in whole or in part, or to meet the goals of a court approved treatment

6    plan constitutes prima facie evidence that return of the child to that parent would create a

7    substantial risk of detriment.

8        (b)  In making a determination under this section, the court shall review the report prepared

9    by the Division of Child and Family Services, a report prepared by the child's guardian ad litem,

10    any report prepared by a foster care citizen review board pursuant to Section 78-3g-103, any

11    evidence regarding the efforts or progress demonstrated by the parent, and the extent to which the

12    parent cooperated and availed himself of services provided.

13        [(c)  The court shall determine whether reasonable services have been offered or provided

14    to the parent or guardian.]

15        (3) (a)  If a child is not returned to his parent or guardian at the permanency hearing, the

16    court shall order termination of reunification services to the parent, and make a final determination

17    regarding whether termination of parental rights, adoption, guardianship, or long-term foster care

18    is the most appropriate final plan for the child.  If the child clearly desires contact with the parent,

19    the court shall take the child's desire into consideration in determining the final plan.

20        (b)  The court may, in its discretion, enter any other order that it determines to be in the

21    best interest of the child.  The court may order the division to provide protective supervision or

22    other services to a child and the child's family after the division's custody of a child has been

23    terminated.

24        (4)  If the final plan for the child is to proceed toward termination of parental rights, the

25    petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed, and a pretrial held, within 45 calendar days

26    after the permanency hearing.

27        (5)  Nothing in this section may be construed to:

28        (a)  entitle any parent to reunification services for any specified period of time;

29        (b)  limit a court's ability to terminate reunification services at any time prior to a

30    permanency hearing; or

31        (c)  limit or prohibit the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights by any party,

- 34 -


1    or a hearing on termination of parental rights, at any time prior to a permanency hearing.  If a

2    petition for termination of parental rights is filed prior to the date scheduled for a permanency

3    hearing, the court may schedule the hearing on termination of parental rights in lieu of the

4    permanency hearing; combine the permanency hearing and the hearing on termination of parental

5    rights; or schedule the hearings separately.  If the court schedules the hearing on termination of

6    parental rights in lieu of the permanency hearing, any reunification services shall be terminated

7    in accordance with the time lines described in Section 78-3a-311 and, in accordance with federal

8    law, a determination regarding the permanency of the child shall be made within 18 months from

9    the date of the child's removal.

10        Section 18.  Section  78-3a-350 is amended to read:

11         78-3a-350.  Separate procedures for minors committed to the Division of Child and

12     Family Services on grounds other than abuse or neglect -- Attorney general responsibility.

14    Proceedings, designed to meet the needs of minors who are abused or neglected, are not applicable

15    to a minor who is committed to the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services on a

16    basis other than abuse or neglect and who are classified in the division's management information

17    system as having been placed in custody primarily on the basis of delinquent behavior or a status

18    offense.

19        (2)  The procedures described in Subsection 78-3a-119(2)(a) are applicable to the minors

20    described in Subsection (1).

21        (3)  The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of a minor

22    described in Subsection (1).

23        (4)  As of July 1, 1998, the attorney general's office shall represent the Division of Child

24    and Family Services with regard to actions involving minors who have not been adjudicated as

25    abused or neglected, but who are otherwise committed to the custody of the division by the

26    juvenile court, and who are classified in the division's management information system as having

27    been placed in custody primarily on the bases of delinquent behavior or a status offense.

28        Section 19.  Section  78-3a-408 is amended to read:

29         78-3a-408.  Evidence of grounds for termination.

30        (1)  In determining whether a parent or parents have abandoned a child, it is prima facie

31    evidence of abandonment that the parent or parents:

- 35 -


1        (a)  although having legal custody of the child, have surrendered physical custody of the

2    child, and for a period of six months following the surrender have not manifested to the child or

3    to the person having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical custody

4    or to make arrangements for the care of the child;

5        (b)  have failed to communicate with the child by mail, telephone, or otherwise for six

6    months; or

7        (c)  failed to have shown the normal interest of a natural parent, without just cause.

8        (2)  In determining whether a parent or parents are unfit or have neglected a child the court

9    shall consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances, conduct, or conditions:

10        (a)  emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent that renders him

11    unable to care for the immediate and continuing physical or emotional needs of the child for

12    extended periods of time;

13        (b)  conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or abusive

14    nature;

15        (c)  habitual or excessive use of intoxicating liquors, controlled substances, or dangerous

16    drugs that render the parent unable to care for the child;

17        (d)  repeated or continuous failure to provide the child with adequate food, clothing,

18    shelter, education, or other care necessary for his physical, mental, and emotional health and

19    development by a parent or parents who are capable of providing that care.  However, a parent

20    who, legitimately practicing his religious beliefs, does not provide specified medical treatment for

21    a child is not for that reason alone a negligent or unfit parent;
