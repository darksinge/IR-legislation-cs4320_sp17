Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the division shall petition the appropriate                          juvenile court, alleging a material and substantial change in the circumstances of a child who is                             subject to the court s jurisdiction, meriting revision of existing court orders to allow for removal                          of the child from this state and the division s custody, if                                 a   parental rights have not been terminated with regard to that child                                 b   the parent of the child who is subject to the court order has established domicile or                          residence in another state, either pursuant to court order or as an exercise of a constitutional right                          to travel                                 c   the parent of the child who is subject to the court order is able to show, by substantial                          evidence, that it is more likely than not that                                 i   the child was either domiciled or residing in that other state when the division removed                          the child                                 ii   the child will receive necessary child welfare services in that other state  or                                iii   the child is the subject of a petition filed in a juvenile court in that other state by a                          person or entity that has standing to file that petition, and the child will receive necessary child                          welfare services under order of that court, in accordance with the provisions of the laws of that                          state  and                                d   where applicable, the provisions of Title   A, Chapter  a, Part  , Interstate Compact                          on the Placement of Children  Title   , Chapter   c, Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction, and the                          federal Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of     ,    U.S.C. Section     A, have been complied                          with.                                    a   In the absence of exigent circumstances, when the goal of a treatment plan is                          reunification and the child is in the custody of the division, and a previously custodial parent with                          whom reunification is sought has notified the division that specified conduct of the division                          regarding the child violates or prevents the exercise of religious beliefs or conduct, or infringes on                          the conscience of the parent or child, the division may not engage in or prohibit the conduct unless,                          after a hearing, the juvenile court determines that the division has shown by clear and convincing                          evidence that                                 i   the division s proposed action or conduct is essential to the immediate well being of the                          child  and                                ii   the action taken is the least restrictive alternative to achieve the immediate protection                          or well being of the child.                                b   Administrative convenience for the division is insufficient justification for violating                             the religious beliefs or matters of conscience of a parent who is seeking reunification with his                          child.                                c   There is a rebuttable presumption that the religious beliefs and matters of conscience                          of the parent are sincerely held and are for the benefit of that parent s family, including the child                          who is in the division s custody.  If that presumption is challenged, the parent may overcome the                          challenge by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that                                 i   the religious beliefs or matters of conscience are sincerely held                                 ii   the religious beliefs or matters of conscience held by the parent are infringed upon or                          impeded by the action or conduct of the division, its employees, or agents  and                                iii   other professionally accepted and competent, less intrusive alternatives exist, which                          could be used to meet the needs of the child without infringing on the religious belief or matter of                          conscience of the parent.  Other professionally competent alternatives may be established before                          the court by the professional opinion of a person licensed in this or another state, or the                          presentation to the court of at least two peer reviewed articles regarding alternate courses of                          conduct.                                    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a parent of any child in the custody of the                          division is entitled to all records in the control or custody of the division that affect that child.  The                          parent is entitled to provide, at his own expense, an independent medical, psychiatric, or                          psychological examination of his child to the court at any stage of a civil abuse or neglect                          proceeding.  The parent, his counsel, or any person designated in writing by either of them, is                          entitled to review division and public court records relating to the named child with a member of                          the Legislature, or his designee.                                    In an abuse or neglect proceeding in juvenile court or on appeal, a parent may raise the                          defense of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding any matter that has an alleged or actual                          impact on the formulation, adoption, or failure to fulfill or comply with any part of a treatment plan                          regarding any child or his parent or guardian.  The division, or any other party to the action, may                          challenge or oppose a parent s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.                               Section  .    Section      A  a         is amended to read                                   A  a    .  Investigation by division    Temporary protective custody.                                    The division shall make a thorough investigation upon receiving either an oral or                           written report of alleged abuse, neglect, fetal alcohol syndrome, or fetal drug dependency, when                              there is reasonable cause to suspect a situation of abuse, neglect, fetal alcohol syndrome, or fetal                           drug dependency.  The primary purpose of that investigation shall be protection of the child.                                    The following reported conditions do not, of themselves, create sufficient allegations                          of abuse or neglect for the division to initiate a child protective service investigation                                 a   children, age eight and older, who are left in the parent s or caretaker s home without                          parental supervision for brief periods of time, but not overnight, provided the child has no                          significant medical or handicapping condition                                 b   children, age ten and older, who provide brief supervision for younger children who                          are  at least one year of age or older, provided that the supervised children have no significant                          medical or handicapping condition                                  c   the use of legal substances or tobacco products in the presence of a child                                  d   the presence of head lice, poor grooming, or irregular hygiene practices of a child                                  e   failure of a parent or caretaker to immunize a child                                  f   use of profane language in the presence of a child                                  g   the exercise of parental discipline of a child by spanking, so long as there is no                           significant external or internal physical injury to a child  or                                 h   the refusal of a parent to support, sanction, or approve                                  i   a minor s desire to obtain an abortion                                  ii   a minor s engaging in conduct that violates the parent s religious beliefs  or                                 iii   a minor s engaging in conduct that is prohibited by state law, including acts of                           fornication, sodomy, or adultery.                                           The investigation may include inquiry into the child s home environment,                            emotional, or mental health, nature and extent of injuries, and physical safety.                                           The division shall make a written report of its investigation. The written report                            shall include a determination regarding whether the alleged abuse or neglect was substantiated or                            unsubstantiated.                                           a   The division shall use an interdisciplinary approach whenever possible in                            dealing with reports made under this part.                                 b   For this purpose, the division shall convene appropriate interdisciplinary  child                            protection teams  to assist it in its protective, diagnostic, assessment, treatment, and coordination                            services.                                    c   A representative of the division shall serve as the team s coordinator and chair.                             Members of the team shall serve at the coordinator s invitation, and whenever possible, the team                            shall include representatives of health, mental health, education, law enforcement agencies, and                            other appropriate agencies or individuals.                                           In any case where the division supervises, governs, or directs the affairs of any                            individual, institution, or facility that has been alleged to be involved in acts or omissions of child                            abuse or neglect, the investigation of the reported child abuse or neglect shall be conducted by an                            agency other than the division.                                           If a report of neglect is based upon or includes an allegation of educational neglect                            the division shall immediately consult with school authorities to verify the child s status in                            accordance with Sections       A            through       A           .                                           When the division has completed its initial investigation under this part, it shall                            give notice of that completion to the person who made the initial report.                                           Division workers or other child protection team members have authority to enter                            upon public or private premises, using appropriate legal processes, to investigate reports of alleged                            child abuse or neglect.                                            In accordance with the procedures and requirements of Sections       A  a    .                                through       A  a    .      and         a        , a division worker or child protection team member may take                            a child into protective custody, and deliver the child to a law enforcement officer, or place the child                            in an emergency shelter facility approved by the juvenile court, at the earliest opportunity                            subsequent to the child s removal from its original environment. Control and jurisdiction over the                            child is determined by the provisions of Title   , Chapter  a, and as otherwise provided by law.                                Section  .   Severability clause.                                If any provision of this act, or the application of any provision to any person or                           circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this act shall be given effect without the invalid                           provision or application.                                Section  .   Effective date.                                If approved by two thirds of all the members elected to each house, this act takes effect                           upon approval by the governor, or the day following the constitutional time limit of Utah                           Constitution Article VII, Section  , without the governor s signature, or in the case of a veto, the                           date of veto override.        Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM     This legislation raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns    The provisions enacted by this legislation in Section   A  a    .  affect and potentially conflict  with existing statutory provisions throughout Title   A, Chapter  a, and Title   , Chapter  a, Parts    and  , regarding the standards for civil abuse and neglect proceedings.  Because of the broad  nature of the proposed provisions and the limited time for review, it is not possible to provide a  thorough legal and constitutional analysis of each potential conflict.   Subsection     of   A  a    . , absent any limitation or definition of  religious beliefs  or   matters of conscience  may also conflict with existing code provisions throughout Title   A,  Chapter  a, and Title   , Chapter  a, Parts   and  , which define abuse and neglect and provide  procedures and guidelines for the courts to determine when a parent s action is abusive.  Several  existing Utah Code sections  for example, Section   A  a     , the United States and Utah  Constitution, and state and federal case law currently protect parents  constitutional rights. The  same potential conflict exists with regard to Subsection   A  a       .  This provision also  requires an additional court hearing and determination, requiring proof by clear and convincing  evidence, regarding issues that have been and will be considered by the court in proceedings that  are currently statutorily prescribed.   It is uncertain how the provision relating to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will  interrelate to existing court rules and rules of procedure, but, on its face, it does not appear to  conflict.   Additionally, the effect of Subsection   A  a        h  i , regarding a minor s attempt or desire  to obtain an abortion, may be interpreted under the latest   th Circuit opinion,  Jane L. v. Bangerter,      F d            , to place a  substantial obstacle  or  undue burden  on a minor woman, and  therefore may be considered unconstitutional under the   th Circuit s opinion.
