        (1) (a)  (i)  The commission may require any telecommunications corporation to

    interconnect its essential facilities with another telecommunications corporation that provides

    public telecommunications services in the same, adjacent, or overlapping service territory.

        (ii)  Interconnecting telecommunications corporations shall permit the mutual exchange

    of traffic between their networks without unreasonable blocking or other unreasonable restrictions

    on the flow of traffic.  In determining unreasonable blocking or unreasonable restrictions, the

    commission shall, among other things, take into account the necessity and time required for

    adapting the network to respond to significant changes in usage patterns.

        (b) (i)  Whenever the commission grants a certificate to one or more telecommunications

    corporations to provide public telecommunications services in the same or overlapping service

    territories, all telecommunications corporations providing public telecommunications services in


    the affected area shall have the right to interconnect with the essential facilities and to purchase the

    essential services of all other certificate holders operating in the same area on a nondiscriminatory

    and reasonably unbundled basis.

        (ii)  Each telecommunications corporation shall permit access to and interconnection with

    its essential facilities and the purchase of its essential services on terms and conditions, including

    price, no less favorable than those the telecommunications corporation provides to itself and its

    affiliates.

        (c)  Nothing in this section  shall prevent a telecommunications corporation from entering

    into nondiscriminatory agreements for interconnection with its essential facilities and the purchase

    and sale of essential services.

        (d) (i)  A telecommunications corporation shall file with the commission the prices, terms,

    and conditions of any agreement it makes for the interconnection of essential facilities or the

    purchase or sale of essential services.

        (ii)  The agreement shall take effect ten days after filing.

        (iii)  Each telecommunications corporation shall allow any other telecommunications

    corporation to obtain interconnection with its essential facilities and to purchase essential services

        (e)  If there is a dispute over interconnection of essential facilities [or], the purchase and sale

    of essential services, or the planning or provisioning of facilities or unbundled elements, one or both

    of the disputing parties may bring the dispute to the commission, and the commission, by order, shall

    resolve the dispute on an expedited basis.

        (f)  It is not a discriminatory pricing practice to vary prices to reflect genuine cost differences.

        (2) (a)  The commission shall adopt rules or issue an interim order which implements by

    December 31, 1996, the competitive provision of facilities-based intraLATA toll and local exchange

    services.

        (b)  The rules or interim order shall address those issues the commission determines are

    essential for a competing telecommunications corporation to provide intraLATA toll and local

    exchange services and necessary to protect the public interest, including the interconnection with

- 2 -


    essential facilities and the purchase and sale of essential services of telecommunications corporations

    authorized to provide public telecommunications services in the same or overlapping service

    territories on a nondiscriminatory and reasonably unbundled basis.

        (3) (a)  By December 31, 1997, the commission shall adopt additional rules or issue a  final

    order to implement the competitive provision of facilities-based intraLATA toll and local exchange

    services.

        (b)  The rules or final order shall address other issues relating to:

        (i)  competition for intraLATA toll and local exchange services;

        (ii)  blocking, timing of provisioning of unbundled elements, and service quality standards

    for interconnecting carriers;

        [(ii)] (iii)  the transition to a competitive market; and

        [(iii)] (iv)  the protection of the public interest.

        (4)  Nothing in this section shall require or prohibit the commission from ordering changes

        (5)  If the commission, by order, approves the application of a telecommunications

    corporation to provide public telecommunications services in all or part of the service territory

    certificated to an incumbent telephone corporation before the adoption of the rules or final order

    described in Subsection (3), the commission may:

        (a)  order the interconnection of essential facilities and the purchase and sale of the essential

    services of a telecommunications corporation with those of a competing telecommunications

    corporation on such terms and conditions and to the extent necessary to allow the competing

    telecommunications corporation to operate under authority granted by the commission; and

        (b)  address and resolve, by order, other issues  necessary for the competitive provision of

    intraLATA toll and local exchange services. 

        Section 2.  Section  54-8b-2.4 is amended to read:

         54-8b-2.4.  Price regulation -- Maximum prices.

        (1)  The Legislature finds that:

        (a)  traditional rate of return regulation cannot guarantee that customers who do not have the

- 3 -


    choice of alternative providers will be protected from the economic responsibility for making up for

    an incumbent telephone corporation's competitive losses or from providing for the recovery of past,

    regulated investments;

        (b)  the method of regulation set forth in this section will provide better protection to

    customers who lack competitive choices than does traditional rate of return regulation; and

        (c)  before moving from traditional rate of return regulation, it is essential the commission

    address issues relating to the movement of prices towards cost and removing subsidies in the existing

    price structure of incumbent telephone corporations to encourage competition for all

    telecommunications services.

        (2) (a)  Effective May 1, 1997, any incumbent telephone corporation with more than 30,000

    access lines in the state shall be regulated pursuant to this section and may not be regulated on the

    basis of rate of return or any similar method of regulation that is based on the earnings of the

    incumbent telephone corporation, except as provided in this section.

        (b)  Any incumbent telephone corporation serving fewer than 30,000 access lines in the state

    may petition the commission to be regulated under price regulation  rather than traditional rate of

    return regulation.  In adopting price regulation for incumbent telephone corporations with fewer than

    30,000 access lines, the commission may modify the provisions of this section taking into

    consideration the individual circumstances of the incumbent telephone corporation seeking price

    regulation.

        (3) (a)  Any general rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than

    30,000 access lines in the state initiated before May 1, 1997, shall be based on a 1996 test period and

    shall be conducted under the principles of traditional rate of return regulation, even though the final

    order in the case is not issued until May 1, 1997, or thereafter.

        (b)  A rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than 30,000 access

    lines in the state may be initiated after April 30, 1997, and before March 1, 1998.

        (i)  The rate proceeding shall be revenue neutral relative to the last proceeding filed pursuant

    to Subsection (3)(a), except that the commission may increase or decrease the revenue anticipated

    from all rates to account for changes in the following factors which are known and measurable at the

- 4 -


    time of hearings in the case:

        (A)  any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone

    corporation required by federal or state law or approval by the commission;

        (B)  changes in rules of the Federal Communications Commission, including rules with

    regard to the separation of interstate and intrastate revenues, expenses, or investments;

    corporation resulting from:

        (I)  accounting rules adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and approved by

    the commission; or

        (II)  laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction; or

        (E)  any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April 30, 1997.

        (ii)  In the rate proceeding, the commission may also rebalance rates of particular services

    to move rates of those services toward cost.

        (4) (a)  The prices of tariffed telecommunications services offered by an incumbent telephone

    corporation with more than 30,000 access lines in the state may not increase during the three-year

    period commencing with the date of the final order in the last rate case initiated  before May 1, 1997. 

    The prices of services offered pursuant to a price list or competitive contract shall be governed by

    Section 54-8b-2.3.

        (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (4)(a), prices may increase pursuant to any prices

    established in a final order of the commission for a [general] rate proceeding initiated before [May]

    March 1, [1997] 1998, or the adjustment of those prices as a result of an appeal or remand of the

    final order.

        (5) (a)  Effective at the end of the three-year period specified in Subsection (4), the

    commission shall regulate the maximum prices for the tariffed public telecommunications services

    of the incumbent telephone corporation according to an aggregate price index or price indices

    associated with groups of services.  The aggregate price index or price indices shall be adjusted

    annually to reflect the effects of inflation, productivity, and exogenous factors and to maintain an

- 5 -


    appropriate level of service quality.  The precise manner of annual adjustment shall be developed

    by the commission after notice and a hearing and before the end of the three-year period.

        (b)  Factors in the price index or price indices may also include the following:

        (i)  any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone

    corporation required by federal or state law or approved by the commission;

        (ii)  the impact of alteration in asset lives to better reflect changes in the economic lives of

    plant and equipment approved by the commission consistent with Section 54-7-12.1;

        (B)  laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction; or

        (vi)  any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April 30, 1997.

        (6) (a)  The incumbent telephone corporation may decrease the price of a tariffed

    telecommunications service subject to the limitation in Section 54-8b-3.3.

        (b)  Any decrease in price shall be made by filing a tariff with the commission.  The decrease

    shall become effective 30 days after filing.
