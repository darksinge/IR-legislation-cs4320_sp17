For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the person          to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician, or other          person present as a condition for the taking of any test.                   If a person  under arrest  refuses to submit to a chemical test or tests or any additional          test under this section, evidence of any refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or          proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was operating or          in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, any drug,          combination of alcohol and any drug, or while having any measurable controlled substance or          metabolite of a controlled substance in the person s body.
