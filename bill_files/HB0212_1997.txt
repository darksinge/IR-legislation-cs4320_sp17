This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                  A      . , as enacted by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section    A      .  is amended to read                  A      . .   Coordination of human services and educational services    Licensing           of programs    Procedures.                   A human services program may not be licensed to serve children subject to compulsory          education under Section   A        or entitled to educational services under Section   A                 unless the program presents evidence satisfactory to the licensing authority and to the local school          board of the school district in which the program will be operated that children served by the          program shall receive appropriate educational services satisfying the requirements of applicable          law.                   If the human services program is to be permitted to serve any children whose custodial          parents or legal guardians reside outside the state, then the program shall also provide satisfactory          evidence to the licensing authority and to the school district in which the program will be operated          that all costs for educational services to be provided to those students, including tuition and school          fees approved by the local school board, shall be borne by the program.                   If the local school board finds the educational service plan and the educational funding           plan to be adequate, then the board shall provide the licensing authority with a letter of approval.                  If the local school board finds the educational service plan and the educational funding         plan to be inadequate, then the board shall provide the licensing authority with a letter of         disapproval, together with the specific requirements the human services program must meet before         licensure is granted.                  Failure of a local school board to respond to a proposed plan within    days of receipt         is equivalent to approval of the plan by the board.                  If a human services program fails to comply with its approved educational service plan         or educational funding plan, then the licensing authority shall give the program notice of intent to          revoke the licensure and, if the program continues its noncompliance for more than    days after          receipt of notice, shall revoke the program s license.                   If a child whose custodial parent or legal guardian resides within the state is provided          with educational services by a school district other than the school district in which the custodial          parent or legal guardian resides, then the funding provisions of Section   A       apply.                    For purposes of this section, a child who is placed in the state under Title   A,          Chapter  a, Part  , Interstate Compact on Placement of Children, is considered to have a legal          guardian residing within the state.
