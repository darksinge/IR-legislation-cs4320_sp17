Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
42

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
78A-6-502.5

 is enacted to read:
            
43

    
     78A-6-502.5.  Statement of parental liberty interests.
            
44

    
    (1)  The severance and termination of family ties by the state is a step of the utmost
            
45

    
gravity, which may only be done for the most compelling reasons.
            
46

    
    (2)  It is generally in the best interest and welfare of a child to be reared under the care
            
47

    
of the child's natural parents.
            
48

    
    (3)  Termination of parental rights cannot be decreed without giving full and serious
            
49

    
consideration to the prior and fundamental right of a parent to rear the parent's child and,
            
50

    
concomitantly, of the right of the child to be reared by the child's natural parent.
            
51

    
    (4)  A parent has a fundamental right protected by the U.S. Constitution to sustain the
            
52

    
parent's relationship with the parent's child.
            
53

    
    (5) (a)  Recognition of due process and retained rights of parents promotes values
            
54

    
essential to the preservation of human freedom and dignity and the perpetuation of our
            
55

    
democratic society.
            
56

    
    (b)  Any invasion of the sanctity of the family, even with the loftiest of motives,
            
57

    
unavoidably threatens the values described in Subsection (5)(a).
            
58

    
    (6)  No court shall, but for the gravest of reasons, transfer a child from the child's

            
59


    
natural parent to any other person, since the right of a parent under natural law to establish a
            
60

    
home and bring up children is fundamental and beyond the reach of any court.
            
61

    
    (7)  Where there is still reason to believe that positive, nurturing parent-child
            
62

    
relationships can exist, including extended family association and support, the interest of the
            
63

    
state favors preservation, not severance, of natural familial bonds.
            
64

    
    Section 2.

78A-6-507.5

 is enacted to read:

68

    


78A-6-506

 and disputes that the parent's parental rights should be terminated, may:
            
69

    
    (a)  contest the petition; and
            
70

    
    (b)  in the alternative, submit a petition naming an individual to serve as legal guardian
            
71

    
for the child, if:
            
72

    
    (i)  the nominee is an adult who is a grandparent, great-grandparent, aunt, great-aunt,
            
73

    
uncle, great-uncle, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepparent, first cousin, sibling, or stepsibling
            
74

    
of the child;
            
75

    
    (ii)  the nominee consents to the guardianship relationship; and
            
76

    
    (iii)  the parent's rights are ultimately terminated.
            
77

    
    (2)  The division shall make a recommendation to the court regarding the fitness of the
            
78

    
nominee described in Subsection (1) to serve as the child's guardian.
            
79

    
    (3)  The court shall:
            
80

    
    (a)  consider:
            
81

    
    (i)  the principles, rights, protections, and requirements described and recognized in this
            
82

    
part;
            
83

    
    (ii)  the recommendation of the division, described in Subsection (2);
            
84

    
    (iii)  the desires of the child, if the child is 12 years of age or older;
            
85

    
    (iv)  the fundamental right of a parent to choose who shall raise and care for the parent's
            
86

    
child; and
            
87

    
    (v)  the fundamental right of a child to be reared by the child's parent or the parent's
            
88

    
designee; and
            
89

    
    (b)  if it appears the parent will not be able to successfully contest the petition for

            
90


    
termination of parental rights, order a legal guardianship relationship between the child and the
            
91

    
nominee, if it is in the best interest of the child and a means of achieving the strong public
            
92

    
policy in support of family preservation.
            
93

    
    (4)  In an order granting the petition for guardianship, the court shall describe:
            
94

    
    (a)  what limitations, if any, the guardian shall place on the parent's access to the child
            
95

    
as a condition for continued guardianship; and
            
96

    
    (b)  what role, if any, the division will fill in supervising the guardianship placement.
            
97

    
    (5)  If granted, the court shall review the guardianship placement six months after the
            
98

    
day on which the guardianship petition is granted to review whether guardianship is still
            
99

    
appropriate and consistent with controlling constitutional rights.
            
100

    
    (6)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as a guarantee that a nominee will be
            
101

    
allowed to serve as a legal guardian for a child, but the nominee shall be given added weight
            
102

    
and strong and thorough consideration.
            
103

    
    (7)  Legal guardianship, as described and established in this section, is:
            
104

    
    (a)  considered a permanent placement for purposes of complying with federal law, if
            
105

    
the guardianship is ordered without the continued supervision of the division; and
            
106

    
    (b)  most appropriate when a former parent:
            
107

    
    (i)  has made progress toward becoming a fit parent, but has not yet succeeded; and
            
108

    
    (ii)  may become a fit parent with additional time and assistance.
            
109

    
    Section 3.

     78A-6-511.  Court disposition of child upon termination.
            
111

    
    (1)  As used in this section, "relative" means:
            
112
