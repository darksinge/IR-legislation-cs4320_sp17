The state's attorney and123     the defendant shall be permitted to present argument for or against the sentence of death.124          (3)  Aggravating circumstances include those outlined in Section 76-5-202.125          (4)  Mitigating circumstances include:126          (a)  the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;127          (b)  the homicide was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental128     or emotional disturbance;129          (c)  the defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person;130          (d)  at the time of the homicide, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the131     wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of law was impaired132     as a result of a mental condition, intoxication, or influence of drugs, except that "mental133     condition" under this Subsection (4)(d) does not mean an abnormality manifested primarily by134     repeated criminal conduct;135          (e)  the youth of the defendant at the time of the crime;136          (f)  the defendant was an accomplice in the homicide committed by another person and137     the defendant's participation was relatively minor; and138          (g)  any other fact in mitigation of the penalty.139          (5) (a)  The court or jury, as the case may be, shall retire to consider the penalty.  Except140     as provided in [Subsection] Subsections 76-3-207.5(2) and 76-3-206(2)(b), in all proceedings141     before a jury, under this section, it shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon142     a unanimous decision for death and that the penalty of either an indeterminate prison term of143     not less than 25 years and which may be for life or life in prison without parole, shall be144     imposed if a unanimous decision for death is not found.145          (b)  The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the146     aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that147     total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable148     doubt, that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances. 149     If the jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall150     discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of death.151          (c)  If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision imposing the sentence of death,152     the jury shall then determine whether the penalty of life in prison without parole shall be153     imposed, except as provided in Subsection 76-3-207.5(2).  The penalty of life in prison without154     parole shall only be imposed if the jury determines that the sentence of life in prison without155     parole is appropriate.  If the jury reports agreement by 10 jurors or more to impose the sentence156     of life in prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence157     of life in prison without parole.  If 10 jurors or more do not agree upon a sentence of life in158     prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury and impose an indeterminate prison159     term of not less than 25 years and which may be for life.160          (d)  If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, with the approval161     of the court and the consent of the prosecution, the court shall determine the appropriate162     penalty according to the standards of Subsections (5)(b) and (c).163          (e)  If the defendant is sentenced to more than one term of life in prison with or without164     the possibility of parole, or in addition to a sentence of life in prison with or without the165     possibility of parole the defendant is sentenced for other offenses which result in terms of166     imprisonment, the judge shall determine whether the terms of imprisonment shall be imposed167     as concurrent or consecutive sentences in accordance with Section 76-3-401.168          (6)  Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate169     court, if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence170     of death and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent171     necessary to correct the error or errors.  An error in the sentencing proceedings may not result172     in the reversal of the conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing173     proceedings, all exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted174     in the prior trial and sentencing proceedings are admissible in the new sentencing proceedings,175     and if the sentencing proceeding was before a:176          (a)  jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding unless the177     defendant waives the hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of178     the prosecution, in which case the proceeding shall be held according to Subsection (6)(b) or179     (c), as applicable;180          (b)  judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding; or181          (c)  judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new182     sentencing proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing183     proceeding, and the new proceeding will be before a jury unless the defendant waives the184     hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecution.185          (7)  If the penalty of death is held to be unconstitutional by the Utah Supreme Court or186     the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously187     sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the person to be brought before the court, and188     the court shall sentence the person to life in prison without parole.189          (8) (a)  If the appellate court's final decision regarding any appeal of a sentence of death190     precludes the imposition of the death penalty due to mental retardation or subaverage general191     intellectual functioning under Section 77-15a-101, the court having jurisdiction over a192     defendant previously sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the defendant to be193     brought before the sentencing court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to life in prison194     without parole.195          (b)  If the appellate court precludes the imposition of the death penalty under196     Subsection (8)(a), but the appellate court finds that sentencing the defendant to life in prison197     without parole is likely to result in a manifest injustice, it may remand the case to the198     sentencing court for further sentencing proceedings to determine if the defendant should serve199     a sentence of life in prison without parole or an indeterminate prison term of not less than 25200     years and which may be for life.201          Section 4.  Section 76-3-207.5 is amended to read:202          76-3-207.5.
