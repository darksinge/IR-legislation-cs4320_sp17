If a risk sharing plan under Section       A           exists for the kind of coverage provided                            by the insurance being cancelled or nonrenewed,  no  a notice of cancellation or nonrenewal                            required under Subsection     b  or     b  i   is  may not be effective unless it contains instructions                               to the policyholder for applying for insurance through the available risk sharing plan.                                     There is no liability on the part of, and no cause of action against, any insurer, its                            authorized representatives, agents, employees, or any other person furnishing to the insurer                            information relating to the reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal or for any statement made or                            information given by them in complying or enabling the insurer to comply with this section unless                            actual malice is proved by clear and convincing evidence.                                     This section does not alter any common law right of contract rescission for material                            misrepresentation.
