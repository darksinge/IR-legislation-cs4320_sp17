After that318     time period has expired, a relative or friend who has not obtained custody or asserted an319     interest in a child, may not be granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.320          (b)  When the time period described in Subsection (18)(a) has expired, the preferential321     consideration, which is initially granted to a natural parent in accordance with Subsection (2),322     is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best interest of the323     child.324          (c)  Prior to the expiration of the 120-day period described in Subsection (18)(a), the325     following order of preference shall be applied when determining the person with whom a child326     will be placed, provided that the person is willing, and has the ability, to care for the child:327          (i)  a noncustodial parent of the child;328          (ii)  a relative of the child;329          (iii)  subject to Subsection (18)(d), a friend of a parent of the child[, if the friend is a330     licensed foster parent]; and331          (iv)  other placements that are consistent with the requirements of law.332          (d)  In determining whether a friend is a willing and appropriate placement for a child,333     neither the court, nor the division, is required to consider more than one friend designated by334     each parent of the child.335          [(e)  If a parent of the child is not able to designate a friend who is a licensed foster336     parent for placement of the child, but is able to identify a friend who is willing to become337     licensed as a foster parent:]338          [(i)  the department shall fully cooperate to expedite the licensing process for the friend;339     and]340          [(ii)  if the friend becomes licensed as a foster parent within the time frame described in341     Subsection (18)(a), the court shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to342     place the child with the friend.]343          (19)  If, following the shelter hearing, the child is placed with a person who is not a344     parent of the child, a relative of the child, a friend of a parent of the child, or a former foster345     parent of the child, priority shall be given to a foster placement with a man and a woman who346     are married to each other, unless it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with a347     single foster parent.348          (20)  In determining the placement of a child, neither the court, nor the division, may349     take into account, or discriminate against, the religion of a person with whom the child may be350     placed, unless the purpose of taking religion into account is to place the child with a person or351     family of the same religion as the child.Legislative Review Note     as of  12-15-14  9:57 AMOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
