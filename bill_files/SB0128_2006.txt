Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
24

57-1-38

 is amended to read:
            
25

    
     57-1-38.  Release of security interest.

27

    
    (a)  "Revolving credit line" means an agreement between the borrower and a secured
            
28

    
lender who agrees to loan the borrower money on a continuing basis so long as the outstanding
            
29

    
principal amount owed by the borrower does not exceed a specified amount.

            
30


    
    [(a)] (b)  "Secured lender" means:
            
31

    
    (i)  a mortgagee on a mortgage;
            
32

    
    (ii)  a beneficiary on a trust deed;
            
33

50

    
the foreclosure of a mortgage, the exercise of a trustee's power of sale, the exercise of a seller's
            
51

of a secured lender to enforce the repayment of a secured loan.
            
53

    
    (3)  A secured lender or servicer who fails to release the security interest on a secured

61

    
or servicer:
            
62

    
    (a)  has established a reasonable procedure to release the security interest on a secured
            
63

    
loan in a timely manner after the final payment on the loan;
            
64

    
    (b)  has complied with this procedure in good faith; and
            
65

    
    (c)  is unable to release the security interest within 90 days after receipt of the final
            
66

    
payment because of the action or inaction of an agency or other person beyond its direct
            
67

    
control.
            
68

    
    (5)  A secured lender under a revolving credit line shall close the revolving credit line
            
69

    
and release the security interest if the secured lender receives:

    (a)  payment in full from a third party involved in a sale or loan transaction affecting the
            
71

    
security interest; and
            
72
