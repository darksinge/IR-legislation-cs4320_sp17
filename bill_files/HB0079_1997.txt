Section          is amended to read                       .  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody           consideration.                   If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is declared          void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the minor          children as it considers appropriate. In determining custody, the court shall consider the best          interests of the child and the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties.           The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s desires regarding          the future custody, but the expressed desires are not controlling and the court may determine the          children s custody otherwise.                    a   In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds         relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing the         child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate         and providing a financially stable environment.              b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , the court in awarding custody may not give         preference to one parent over the other on the basis of a parent s gender.                  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has attempted         to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into consideration in         determining whether to award custody to the other parent.                   The court shall enter findings as to the underlying reasons for its award of custody.                   Notwithstanding the separation or divorce of parents and an award of custody under          this section, it is the public policy of this state that                a   a child have frequent, meaningful, and continuing contact with each parent as is          consistent with the best interests of the child                b   each parent share in the rights, responsibilities, and joys of child rearing  and               c   no person hinder, disrupt, or deny court ordered visitation or the attendant parental          rights of a parent to whom custody has not been awarded without legal justification.
