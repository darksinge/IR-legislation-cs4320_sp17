Permission of the juvenile court may be granted by a probation officer of the court in                          the district that would have jurisdiction over the offense being referred to Youth Court.                                    Youth Courts may decline to accept a youth for Youth Court disposition for any reason                          and may terminate a youth from Youth Court participation at any time.

Referral of a case of Youth Court may not prohibit the subsequent referral of the case                           to juvenile court.                                Section  .
