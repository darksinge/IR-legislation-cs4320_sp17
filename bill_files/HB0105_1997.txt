This act shall apply to all service members on military orders who are unable to          perform, continue, or complete civil obligations due to military service.                   This act does not apply to military service performed under orders issued pursuant to          Title    or Title   , United States Code.                   Proper application of this act shall suspend or postpone actions upon those obligations          until    days after discharge from active, full time, military service.              Section  .

A plaintiff, before the entry of a default judgment against a defendant for not         appearing, shall file with the court an affidavit stating that the defendant is not in military service.          If the plaintiff does not know whether the defendant is in military service or not, the affidavit shall         so state.                  If an affidavit is not filed or the affidavit states that the plaintiff does not know whether         the defendant is in military service, the court may not enter a default judgment unless it appoints         an attorney to represent the defendant and protect his interest.  The attorney shall, through inquiry,         determine whether the service member s ability to comply with the terms of the obligation is          materially affected by his military service and report to the court or move for a stay in the service          member s behalf.  An attorney appointed by the court to represent a defendant service member may          not waive any of the service member s rights or bind the service member by his acts.

Any person who makes or uses an affidavit required under this section, or a statement,          declaration, verification, or certificate certified or declared to be true under penalty of perjury          knowing it to be false, is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Vacating, setting aside, or reversing any judgment because of any of the provisions of                 this chapter may not impair any right or title acquired by any bona fide purchaser for value under         the judgment.

If at any point during an action or proceeding it appears that a plaintiff or defendant         is a service member and in the conduct of the proceedings may be adversely affected by his         military service, the court may, on its own motion, stay the proceedings.                  The court shall stay the proceedings if the service member or another person on his         behalf makes a request in writing to the court, unless the court determines on the record that the          ability of the plaintiff to prosecute the action or the defendant to conduct his defense is not          materially affected by reason of his military service.
