If big game animals are damaging livestock forage, fences, or irrigation equipment on                           private land or are consuming livestock forage on private land, the landowner or lessee may                           request the division to take action to prevent depredation.                                    a   Within a reasonable time, not to exceed    hours after receiving the request, the                           division shall investigate the situation.
