Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
35

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
24-1-8

 is amended to read:
            
36

    
     24-1-8.  Criminal procedures.
            
37

    
    (1)  In cases where an owner is criminally prosecuted for conduct giving rise to
            
38

    
forfeiture, the prosecuting attorney may elect to forfeit the owner's interest in the property
            
39

    
civilly or criminally, provided that no civil forfeiture judgment may be entered with respect to
            
40

    
the property of a defendant who is acquitted of the offense on which the forfeiture claim is
            
41

    
based.
            
42

    
    (2)  If the prosecuting attorney elects to criminally forfeit the owner's interest in the
            
43

    
property, the information or indictment must state that the owner's interest in the specifically
            
44

    
described property is subject to criminal forfeiture and the basis for the forfeiture.
            
45

    
    (3) (a)  Upon application of the prosecuting attorney, the court may enter restraining
            
46

    
orders or injunctions, or take other reasonable action to preserve for forfeiture under this
            
47

    
section any forfeitable property if, after notice to persons known, or discoverable after due
            
48

    
diligence, to have an interest in the property and after affording them an opportunity for a
            
49

    
hearing, the court determines that:
            
50

    
    (i)  there is a substantial probability that the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture
            
51

    
and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being sold, transferred, destroyed,
            
52

    
or removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and
            
53

    
    (ii)  the need to preserve the availability of the property or prevent its sale, transfer,
            
54

    
destruction, or removal through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship against
            
55

    
any party against whom the order is to be entered.
            
56

    
    (b)  A temporary restraining order may be entered ex parte upon application of the
            
57

    
prosecuting attorney before or after an information or indictment has been filed with respect to

            
58


    
the property, if the prosecuting attorney demonstrates that:
            
59

    
    (i)  there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is
            
60

    
sought would, in the event of a conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section; and
            
61

    
    (ii)  provision of notice would jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture
            
62

    
or would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.
            
63

    
    (c)  The temporary order expires not more than ten days after entry unless extended for
            
64

    
good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension.  An
            
65

    
adversarial hearing concerning an order entered under this [paragraph] section shall be held as
            
66

    
soon as practicable and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.
            
67

    
    (d)  The court is not bound by the Utah Rules of Evidence regarding evidence it may
            
68

    
receive and consider at any hearing under this [paragraph] section.
            
69

    
    (4) (a)  Upon conviction by a jury of an owner for conduct giving rise to criminal
            
70

    
forfeiture, the jury shall be instructed and asked to return a special verdict as to the extent of
            
71

    
the property identified in the information or indictment, if any, that is forfeitable.
            
72

    
    (b)  Whether property is forfeitable shall be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
            
73

    
    (5) (a)  Upon conviction of a person for violating any provision of state law subjecting
            
74

    
an owner's property to forfeiture and upon the jury's special verdict that the property is
            
75

    
forfeitable, the court shall enter a judgment and order the property forfeited to the state
            
76

    
[treasurer] upon the terms stated by the court in its order.
            
77

    
    (b)  Following the entry of an order declaring property forfeited, the court may, upon
            
78

    
application of the prosecuting attorney, enter appropriate restraining orders or injunctions,
            
79

    
require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators,
            
80

    
appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the state in
            
81

    
property ordered forfeited.
            
82

    
    (6) (a)  After property is ordered forfeited under this section, the [state treasurer] seizing
            
83

    
agency shall direct the disposition of the property under Section [

24-1-16

] 

24-1-17

.  Any
            
84

    
property right or interest not exercisable by or transferable for value to the state expires and
            
85

    
does not revert to the defendant.  The defendant or any person acting in concert with or on

            
86


    
behalf of the defendant is not eligible to purchase forfeited property at any sale held by the
            
87

    
[state treasurer] seizing agency unless approved by the judge.
            
88

    
    (b)  The court may stay the sale or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of
            
89

    
any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture if the defendant demonstrates that
            
90

    
proceeding with the sale or disposition of the property may result in irreparable injury, harm or
            
91

    
loss to him.
            
92

    
    (7)  Except under [Subparagraphs] Subsection (3) or (10), a party claiming an interest in
            
93

    
property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section:
            
94

    
    (a)  may not intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving the forfeiture of
            
95

    
property under this section; and
            
96

    
    (b)  may not commence an action at law or equity against the state or the county
            
97

    
concerning the validity of his alleged interests in the property subsequent to the filing of an
            
98

    
indictment or an information alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this
            
99

    
section.
            
100

    
    (8)  The district court of the state which has jurisdiction of a case under this part may
            
101

    
enter orders under this section without regard to the location of any property which may be
            
102

    
subject to forfeiture under this section, or which has been ordered forfeited under this section.
            
103

    
    (9)  To facilitate the identification or location of property declared forfeited and to
            
104

    
facilitate the disposition of petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture, after the entry of
            
105

    
an order declaring property forfeited to the state [treasurer], the court[,] may upon application
            
106

    
of the prosecuting attorney[,] order that the testimony of any witness relating to the property
            
107

    
forfeited be taken by deposition, and that any book, paper, document, record, recording, or
            
108

    
other material not privileged shall be produced as provided for depositions and discovery under
            
109

    
the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.
            
110

    
    (10) (a)  Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the prosecuting
            
111

    
attorney shall publish notice of the order's intent to dispose of the property as the court may
            
112

    
direct.  The prosecuting attorney shall also provide direct written notice to any person known to
            
113

    
have an alleged interest in the property subject to the order of forfeiture.

            
114


    
    (b)  Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property which
            
115

    
has been ordered forfeited to the state [treasurer] under this section may, within 30 days of the
            
116

    
final publication of notice or his receipt of written notice under [Subparagraph (a)] Subsection
            
117

    
(10)(a), whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his
            
118

    
alleged interest in the property.  Any genuine issue of material fact, including issues of
            
119

    
standing, is triable to a jury upon demand of any party.
            
120

    
    (c)  The petition shall be in writing and signed by the petitioner under penalty of
            
121

    
perjury.  It shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner's right, title, or interest in the
            
122

    
property, the time and circumstances of the petitioner's acquisition of the right, title, or interest
            
123

    
in the property, and any additional facts supporting the petitioner's claim and the relief sought.
            
124

    
    (d)  The trial or hearing on the petition shall be expedited to the extent practicable.  The
            
125

    
court may consolidate a trial or hearing on the petition and any petition filed by any other
            
126

    
person under this section other than the defendant.  The court shall permit the parties to
            
127

    
conduct pretrial discovery pursuant to the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.
            
128

    
    (e)  At the trial or hearing, the petitioner may testify and present evidence and witnesses
            
129

    
on his own behalf and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.  The prosecuting
            
130

    
attorney may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of the claim to the
            
131

    
property and cross-examine witnesses who appear.  In addition to testimony and evidence
            
132

    
presented at the trial or hearing, the court may consider the relevant portion of the record of the
            
133

    
criminal case which resulted in the order of forfeiture.  Any trial or hearing shall be conducted
            
134

    
pursuant to the Utah Rules of Evidence.
            
135

    
    (f)  The court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination, if
            
136

    
after the trial or hearing, the court or jury determines that the petitioner has established by a
            
137

    
preponderance of the evidence that:
            
138

    
    (i)  the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and the right, title, or
            
139

    
interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or
            
140

    
interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title,
            
141

    
or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts or conduct which gave rise

            
142


    
to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or
            
143

    
    (ii)  the petitioner acquired the right, title or interest in the property in a bona fide
            
144

    
transaction for value and, at the time of such acquisition, the petitioner did not know that the
            
145

    
property was subject to forfeiture.
            
146

    
    (g)  Following the court's disposition of all petitions filed under this [paragraph]
            
147

    
Subsection (10), or if no petitions are filed following the expiration of the period provided in
            
148

    
[Subparagraph (b)] Subsection (10)(b) for the filing of petitions, the state [treasurer] has clear
            
149

    
title to property subject to the order of forfeiture and may warrant good title to any subsequent
            
150

    
purchaser or transferee.
            
151

    
    Section 2.  
Section  
24-1-15

 is amended to read:
            
152

    
     24-1-15.  Transfer and sharing procedures.
            
153

    
    (1)  For purposes of this section, property is considered to be "seized" whenever any
            
154

    
state, county, or municipal law enforcement agency takes possession of the property or
            
155

    
exercises any degree of control over the property.
            
156

    
    (2)  When property is seized pursuant to the order of a state district court or state
            
157

    
statute, the state has priority jurisdiction.
            
158

    
    [(2) (a)] (3)  Seizing agencies or prosecuting attorneys authorized to bring civil or
            
159

    
criminal forfeiture proceedings under this chapter may not directly or indirectly transfer seized
            
160

    
property not already named in a criminal indictment to any federal agency or any governmental
            
161

    
entity not created under and subject to state law unless the court enters an order, upon petition
            
162

    
of the prosecuting attorney, authorizing the property to be transferred.  The court may not enter
            
163

    
an order authorizing a transfer unless:
            
164

    
    [(i)] (a)  the [activity] conduct giving rise to the investigation or seizure is interstate in
            
165

    
nature and sufficiently complex to justify the transfer;
            
166

    
    [(ii)] (b)  the seized property may only be forfeited under federal law; or
            
167

    
    [(iii)] (c)  pursuing forfeiture under state law would unreasonably burden prosecuting
            
168

    
attorneys or state law enforcement agencies.
            
169

    
    (4)  A petition to transfer property under this section to a federal agency shall include:

            
170


    
    (a)  a detailed description of the property seized;
            
171

    
    (b)  the location where the property was seized;
            
172

    
    (c)  the date the property was seized;
            
173

    
    (d)  case number assigned by the seizing law enforcement agency; and
            
174

    
    (e)  a sworn affidavit that:
            
175

    
    (i)  is signed by the prosecutor;
            
176

    
    (ii)  states the basis for relinquishing priority jurisdiction to a federal agency; and
            
177

    
    (iii)  contains the names and addresses of any potential owners then known.
            
178

    
    [(b)] (5)  Notwithstanding Subsection [(2)(a)] (3), the court may refuse to enter an order
            
179

    
authorizing a transfer to the federal government if the transfer would circumvent the
            
180

    
protections of the Utah Constitution or of this chapter that would otherwise be available to the
            
181

    
property owner.
            
182

    
    [(c)] (6) (a)  Prior to granting any order to transfer pursuant to Subsection [(2)(a)] (3),
            
183
