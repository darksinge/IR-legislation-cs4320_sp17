energy pipeline infrastructure on the subject lands;
            
62

    
    (b) (i)  do not designate, establish, manage, or treat any of the subject lands as an area
            
63

    
with management prescriptions that parallel, duplicate, or resemble the management
            
64

    
prescriptions established for wilderness areas or wilderness study areas, including the
            
65

    
nonimpairment standard applicable to WSAs or anything that parallels, duplicates, or
            
66

    
resembles that nonimpairment standard; and
            
67

    
    (ii)  recognize, follow, and apply the agreement between the state and the Department
            
68

    
of the Interior in the settlement agreement;

    (c)  call upon the BLM to revoke and revise BLM Manuals H 6301, H 6302, and H
            
70

    
6303, issued on or about February 25, 2011, in light of the settlement agreement and the
            
71

    
following principles of this state plan:
            
72

    
    (i)  BLM lacks congressional authority to manage subject lands, other than WSAs, as if
            
73

    
they are or may become wilderness;
            
74

    
    (ii)  BLM lacks authority to designate geographic areas as lands with wilderness
            
75

    
characteristics or designate management prescriptions for such areas other than to use specific
            
76

    
geographic-based tools and prescriptions expressly identified in FLPMA;
            
77

    
    (iii)  BLM lacks authority to manage the subject lands in any manner other than to
            
78

    
prevent unnecessary or undue degradation, unless the BLM uses geographic tools expressly
            
79

    
identified in FLPMA and does so pursuant to a duly adopted provision of a resource
            
80

    
management plan adopted under FLPMA, 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1712;
            
81

    
    (iv)  BLM inventories for the presence of wilderness characteristics must be closely
            
82

    
coordinated with inventories for those characteristics conducted by state and local
            
83

    
governments, and should reflect a consensus among those governmental agencies about the
            
84

    
existence of wilderness characteristics, as follows:
            
85

    
    (A)  any inventory of wilderness characteristics should reflect all of the criteria
            
86

    
identified in the Wilderness Act of 1964, including:
            
87

    
    (I)  a size of 5,000 acres or more, containing no visible roads; and
            
88

    
    (II)  the presence of naturalness, the opportunity for primitive and unconfined
            
89

    
recreation, and the opportunity for solitude;

            
90


    
    (B)  geographic areas found to contain the presence of naturalness must appear pristine
            
91

    
to the average viewer, and not contain any of the implements, artifacts, or effects of human
            
92

    
presence, including:
            
93

    
    (I)  visible roads, whether maintained or not; and
            
94

    
    (II)  human-made features such as vehicle bridges, fire breaks, fisheries, enhancement
            
95

    
facilities, fire rings, historic mining and other properties, including tailings piles, commercial
            
96

    
radio and communication repeater sites, fencing, spring developments, linear disturbances,
            
97

    
stock ponds, visible drill pads, pipeline and transmission line rights-of-way, and other similar
            
98

    
features;
            
99

    
    (C)  factors, such as the following, though not necessarily conclusive, should weigh
            
100

    
against a determination that a land area has the presence of naturalness:
            
101

    
    (I)  the area is or once was the subject of mining and drilling activities;
            
102

    
    (II)  mineral and hard rock mining leases exist in the area; and
            
103

    
    (III)  the area is in a grazing district with active grazing allotments and visible range
            
104

    
improvements;
            
105

    
    (D)  geographic areas found to contain the presence of solitude should convey the sense
            
106

    
of solitude within the entire geographic area identified, otherwise boundary adjustments should
            
107

    
be performed in accordance with Subsection (1)(c)(iv)(F);
            
108

    
    (E)  geographic areas found to contain the presence of an opportunity for primitive and
            
109

    
unconfined recreation must find these features within the entire area and provide analysis about
            
110

    
the effect of the number of visitors to the geographic area upon the presence of primitive or
            
111

    
unconfined recreation, otherwise boundary adjustments should be performed in accordance
            
112

    
with Subsection (1)(c)(iv)(F);
            
113

    
    (F)  in addition to the actions required by the review for roads pursuant to the
            
114

    
definitions of roads contained in BLM Manual H 6301, or any similar authority, the BLM
            
115

    
should, pursuant to its authority to inventory, identify and list all roads or routes identified as
            
116

    
part of a local or state governmental transportation system, and consider those routes or roads
            
117

    
as qualifying as roads within the definition of the Wilderness Act of 1964; and
            
118

    
    (G)  BLM should adjust the boundaries for a geographic area to exclude areas that do
            
119

    
not meet the criteria of lacking roads, lacking solitude, and lacking primitive and unconfined
            
120

    
recreation and the boundaries should be redrawn to reflect an area that clearly meets the criteria

            
121


    
above, and which does not employ minor adjustments to simply exclude small areas with
            
122

    
human intrusions, specifically:
            
123

    
    (I)  the boundaries of a proposed geographic area containing lands with wilderness
            
124

    
characteristics should not be drawn around roads, rights-of-way, and intrusions; and
            
125

    
    (II)  lands located between individual human impacts that do not meet the requirements
            
126

    
for lands with wilderness characteristics should be excluded;
            
127

    
    (v)  BLM should consider the responses of the Department of the Interior under cover
            
128

    
of the letter dated May 20, 2009, clearly stating that BLM does not have the authority to apply
            
129

    
the nonimpairment management standard to the subject lands, or to manage the subject lands in
            
130

    
any manner to preserve their suitability for designation as wilderness, when considering the
            
131

    
proper management principles for areas that meet the full definition of lands with wilderness
            
132

    
characteristics; and
            
133

    
    (vi)  even if the BLM were to properly inventory an area for the presence of wilderness
            
134

    
characteristics, the BLM still lacks authority to make or alter project level decisions to
            
135

    
automatically avoid impairment of any wilderness characteristics without express
            
136

    
congressional authority to do so;
            
137

    
    (d)  achieve and maintain at the highest reasonably sustainable levels a continuing yield
            
138

    
of energy, hard rock, and nuclear resources in those subject lands with economically
            
139

    
recoverable amounts of such resources as follows:
            
140

    
    (i)  the development of the solid, fluid, and gaseous mineral resources in portions of the
            
141

    
subject lands is an important part of the state's economy and the economies of the respective
            
142

    
counties, and should be recognized that it is technically feasible to access mineral and energy
            
143

    
resources in portions of the subject lands while preserving or, as necessary, restoring
            
144

    
nonmineral and nonenergy resources;
            
145

    
    (ii)  all available, recoverable solid, fluid, gaseous, and nuclear mineral resources in the
            
146

    
subject lands should be seriously considered for contribution or potential contribution to the
            
147

    
state's economy and the economies of the respective counties;
            
148

    
    (iii)  those portions of the subject lands shown to have reasonable mineral, energy, and
            
149

    
nuclear potential should be open to leasing, drilling, and other access with reasonable
            
150

    
stipulations and conditions, including mitigation, reclamation, and bonding measures where
            
151

    
necessary, that will protect the lands against unnecessary and undue damage to other significant

            
152


    
resource values;
            
153

    
    (iv)  federal oil and gas existing lease conditions and restrictions should not be
            
154

    
modified, waived, or removed unless the lease conditions or restrictions are no longer
            
155

    
necessary or effective;
            
156

    
    (v)  any prior existing lease restrictions in the subject lands that are no longer necessary
            
157

    
or effective should be modified, waived, or removed;
            
158

    
    (vi)  restrictions against surface occupancy should be eliminated, modified, or waived,
            
159

    
where reasonable;
            
160

    
    (vii)  in the case of surface occupancy restrictions that cannot be reasonably eliminated,
            
161

    
modified, or waived, directional drilling should be considered where the mineral and energy
            
162

    
resources beneath the area can be reached employing available directional drilling technology;
            
163

    
    (viii)  applications for permission to drill in the subject lands that meet standard
            
164

    
qualifications, including reasonable and effective mitigation and reclamation requirements,
            
165

    
should be expeditiously processed and granted; and
            
166

    
    (ix)  any moratorium that may exist against the issuance of qualified mining patents and
            
167

    
oil and gas leases in the subject lands, and any barriers that may exist against developing
            
168

    
unpatented mining claims and filing for new claims, should be carefully evaluated for removal;
            
169

    
    (e)  achieve and maintain livestock grazing in the subject lands at the highest reasonably
            
170

    
sustainable levels by adhering to the policies, goals, and management practices set forth in
            
171

    
Subsection 

63J-4-401


(6)(m);
            
172

    
    (f)  manage the watershed in the subject lands to achieve and maintain water resources
            
173

    
at the highest reasonably sustainable levels as follows:
            
174

    
    (i)  adhere to the policies, goals, and management practices set forth in Subsection
            
175

    

63J-4-401


(6)(m);
            
176

    
    (ii)  deter unauthorized cross-country OHV use in the subject lands by establishing a
            
177

    
reasonable system of roads and trails in the subject lands for the use of an OHV, as closing the
            
178

    
subject lands to all OHV use will only spur increased and unauthorized use; and
            
179

    
    (iii)  keep open any road or trail in the subject lands that historically has been open to
            
180

    
OHV use, as identified on respective county road maps;
            
181

    
    (g)  achieve and maintain traditional access to outdoor recreational opportunities
            
182

    
available in the subject lands as follows:

            
183


    
    (i)  hunting, trapping, fishing, hiking, family and group parties, family and group
            
184

    
campouts and campfires, rock hounding, OHV travel, geological exploring, pioneering,
            
185

    
recreational vehicle parking, or just touring in personal vehicles are activities that are important
            
186

    
to the traditions, customs, and character of the state and individual counties where the subject
            
187

    
lands are located and should continue;
            
188

    
    (ii)  wildlife hunting, trapping, and fishing should continue at levels determined by the
            
189

    
Wildlife Board and the Division of Wildlife Resources and traditional levels of group camping,
            
190

    
group day use, and other traditional forms of outdoor recreation, both motorized and
            
191

    
nonmotorized, should continue; and

make improvements to the roads; and

landowners as follows:
            
218

    
    (i)  the state recognizes that there are parcels of private fee land throughout the subject
            
219

    (k)  manage the subject lands in a manner that supports the fiduciary agreement made
            
228

    
between the state and the federal government concerning the school and institutional trust
            
229

    
lands, as managed according to state law, by:
            
230

    
    (i)  formally recognizing, by duly authorized federal proclamation, the duty of the
            
231

    
federal government to support the purposes of the school and institutional trust lands owned by
            
232

    
the state and administered by SITLA in trust for the benefit of public schools and other
            
233

    
institutions as mandated in the Utah Constitution and the Utah Enabling Act of 1894, 28 Stat.
            
234

237

    
development and for other multiple and consumptive use activities such as mineral
            
238

    
development, grazing, recreation, timber, and agriculture;
            
239

    
    (iii)  not interfering with SITLA's ability to carry out its fiduciary responsibilities by the
            
240

    
creation of geographical areas burdened with management restrictions that prohibit or
            
241

    
discourage the optimization of revenue, without just compensation;
            
242

    
    (iv)  recognizing SITLA's right of economic access to the school trust lands to enable

244

    
    (v)  recognizing any management plan enacted by SITLA pursuant to Section

            
245


    

53C-2-201


; and
            
246

    
    (vi)  acting responsibly as the owner of land parcels with potential for exchange for
            
247

    
state land parcels by:
            
248

    
    (A)  moving forward with the process for identifying federal land parcels suitable and
            
249

    
desirable for exchange for state land parcels;
            
250

    
    (B)  removing barriers to the exchange of federal land parcels for state land parcels;
            
251

    
    (C)  expediting the procedures and processes necessary to execute the exchange of
            
252

    
federal land parcels for state land parcels; and
            
253

    
    (D)  lobbying and supporting in good faith any congressional legislation to enact and
            
254

    
finalize the exchange of federal land parcels for state land parcels;
            
255

    
    (l)  oppose the designation of BLM lands as areas of critical environmental concern
            
256

    
(ACEC), as the BLM lands are generally not compatible with the state's plan and policy for
            
257

    
managing the subject lands, but special cases may exist where such a designation is appropriate
            
258

    
if compliance with FLPMA, 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1702(a) is clearly demonstrated and where the
            
259

    
proposed designation and protection:
            
260

    
    (i)  is limited to the geographic size to the minimum necessary to meet the standards
            
261

    
required by Section 

63J-4-401


;
            
262

    
    (ii)  is necessary to protect not just a temporary change in ground conditions or visual
            
263

    
resources that can be reclaimed or reversed naturally, but is clearly shown as necessary to
            
264

    
protect against visible damage on the ground that will persist on a time scale beyond that which
            
265

    
would effectively disqualify the land for a later inventory of wilderness characteristics;
            
266

    
    (iii)  will not be applied in a geographic area already protected by other protective
            
267

    
designations available pursuant to law; and
            
268

    
    (iv)  is not a substitute for the nonimpairment management requirements of wilderness
            
269

    
study areas; and
            
270

    
    (m)  recognize that a BLM visual resource management class I or II rating is generally
            
271

    
not compatible with the state's plan and policy for managing the subject lands, but special cases
            
272

    
may exist where such a rating is appropriate if jointly considered and created by state, local,
            
273

    
and federal authorities as part of an economic development plan for a region of the state, with
            
274

    
due regard for school trust lands and private lands within the area.
            
275

    
    (2)  All BLM and Forest Service decision documents should be accompanied with an

            
276


    
analysis of the social and economic impact of the decision.  Such analysis should:
            
277

    
    (a)  consider all facets of the decision in light of valuation techniques for the potential
            
278

    
costs and benefits of the decision;
            
279

    
    (b)  clarify whether the costs and benefits employ monetized or nonmonetized
            
280

    
techniques;
            
281

    
    (c)  compare the accuracy, completeness, and viability of monetized and nonmonetized
            
282

    
valuation techniques used as part of the analysis, including all caveats on use of the techniques;
            
283

    
and
            
284

    
    (d)  compare the valuation techniques employed in the analysis to the federal standards
            
285

    
for valuation employed by the U.S. Department of Justice in court actions.
