With respect to the General Fund only, any accumulated fund balance is restricted                            to the following purposes                                  a   to provide working capital to finance expenditures from the beginning of the budget                             year  period until general property taxes, sales taxes, or other applicable revenues are collected,                            thereby reducing the amount which the city must borrow during the period, but this Subsection                               a  does not permit the appropriation of any fund balance for budgeting purposes except as                            provided in Subsection                                      b   to provide a resource to meet emergency expenditures under Section                   and                                 c   to cover a pending year end excess of expenditures over revenues from an unavoidable                            shortfall in revenues.   This provision does not permit the appropriation of any fund balance to                            avoid an operating deficit during any budget  year  period except as provided under Subsection                               , or for emergency purposes under Section                 .

If the fund balance at the close of any fiscal  year  period exceeds the amount permitted                            under Subsection    , the excess shall be appropriated in the manner provided in Section                 .                                     Any fund balance in excess of    of the total revenues of the General Fund may be                            utilized for budget purposes.                                     a   Within a capital improvements fund the governing body may, in any budget  year                            period, appropriate from estimated revenue or fund balance to a reserve for capital improvements                            for the purpose of financing future specific capital improvements, under a formal long range                            capital plan adopted by the governing body.                                 b   The reserves may accumulate from  year   fiscal period to  year  fiscal period until the                            accumulated total is sufficient to permit economical expenditure for the specified purposes.                                 c   Disbursements from these reserves shall be made only by transfer to a revenue or                            transfer account within the capital improvements fund, under a budget appropriation in a budget                            for the fund adopted in the manner provided by this chapter.                                 d   Expenditures from the above appropriation budget accounts shall conform to all                            requirements of this chapter relating to execution and control of budgets.
