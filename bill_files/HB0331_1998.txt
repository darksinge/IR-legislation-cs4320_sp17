19        (ii)  Interconnecting telecommunications corporations shall permit the mutual exchange

20    of traffic between their networks without unreasonable blocking or other unreasonable restrictions

21    on the flow of traffic.  In determining unreasonable blocking or unreasonable restrictions, the

22    commission shall, among other things, take into account the necessity and time required for

23    adapting the network to respond to significant changes in usage patterns.

24        (b) (i)  Whenever the commission grants a certificate to one or more telecommunications

25    corporations to provide public telecommunications services in the same or overlapping service

26    territories, all telecommunications corporations providing public telecommunications services in

27    the affected area shall have the right to interconnect with the essential facilities and to purchase


1    the essential services of all other certificate holders operating in the same area on a

2    nondiscriminatory and reasonably unbundled basis.

3        (ii)  Each telecommunications corporation shall permit access to and interconnection with

8    into nondiscriminatory agreements for interconnection with its essential facilities and the purchase

9    and sale of essential services.

10        (d) (i)  A telecommunications corporation shall file with the commission the prices, terms,

11    and conditions of any agreement it makes for the interconnection of essential facilities or the

12    purchase or sale of essential services.

13        (ii)  The agreement shall take effect ten days after filing.

14        (iii)  Each telecommunications corporation shall allow any other telecommunications

17        (e)  If there is a dispute over interconnection of essential facilities, the purchase and sale

18    of essential services, or the planning or provisioning of facilities or unbundled elements, one or

19    both of the disputing parties may bring the dispute to the commission, and the commission, by

20    order, shall resolve the dispute on an expedited basis.

21        (f)  It is not a discriminatory pricing practice to vary prices to reflect genuine cost

23        (2) (a)  The commission shall adopt rules or issue an interim order which implements by

24    December 31, 1996, the competitive provision of facilities-based intraLATA toll and local

25    exchange services.

26        (b)  The rules or interim order shall address those issues the commission determines are

27    essential for a competing telecommunications corporation to provide intraLATA toll and local

28    exchange services and necessary to protect the public interest, including the interconnection with

29    essential facilities and the purchase and sale of essential services of telecommunications

30    corporations authorized to provide public telecommunications services in the same or overlapping

31    service territories on a nondiscriminatory and reasonably unbundled basis.

1        (3) (a)  By December 31, 1997, the commission shall adopt additional rules or issue a final

2    order to implement the competitive provision of facilities-based intraLATA toll and local

3    exchange services.

4        (b)  The rules or final order shall address other issues relating to:

5        (i)  competition for intraLATA toll and local exchange services;

6        (ii)  blocking, timing of provisioning of unbundled elements, and service quality standards

7    for interconnecting carriers;

10        (4)  [Nothing in this section shall require or prohibit the commission from ordering changes

11    in dialing patterns for intraLATA toll services.] A telephone corporation subject to interLATA

12    telecommunication service restrictions may not be required, including in the rules or an order

13    established under Subsection (3), to provide dialing parity to other telecommunication corporations

14    for the provision of intraLATA long distance service until the telephone corporation:

15        (a)  is also permitted to provide interstate and intrastate interLATA and intraLATA long

16    distance service on an integrated basis; and

17        (b)  is not subject to interLATA telecommunication service restrictions.

18        (5)  If the commission, by order, approves the application of a telecommunications

19    corporation to provide public telecommunications services in all or part of the service territory

21    described in Subsection (3), the commission may:

22        (a)  order the interconnection of essential facilities and the purchase and sale of the

23    essential services of a telecommunications corporation with those of a competing

24    telecommunications corporation on such terms and conditions and to the extent necessary to allow

25    the competing telecommunications corporation to operate under authority granted by the

26    commission; and

27        (b)  address and resolve, by order, other issues necessary for the competitive provision of

28    intraLATA toll and local exchange services.
