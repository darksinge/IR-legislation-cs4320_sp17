12

    
    This bill:
            
13

14

    
amount it received from an overpayment of taxes;
            
15

    
    .    includes court commissioners in the definition of judge for the purpose of imposing

17

    
who retaliate against a commissioner for the performance of the commissioner's
            
18

    
official duties;
            
19

    
    .    increases the amount of per annum compensation a presiding judge receives;
            
20

    
    .    provides that child protective orders expire when the subject of the order is 18 years

22

    
age;
            
23

    
    .     increases the amount of money allocated to the Children's Legal Defense Account
            
24

25

    
    .    clarifies that a defendant has the right to a hearing within three days, if the

27

    
plaintiff has filed a possession bond.

45

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
59-10-529

 is amended to read:
            
46

    
     59-10-529.  Overpayment of tax -- Credits -- Refunds.
            
47

    
    (1)  In cases where there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed by this chapter,
            
48

    
the amount of overpayment is credited as follows:
            
49

    
    (a)  against any income tax then due from the taxpayer;
            
50

    
    (b)  against:
            
51

    
    (i)  the amount of any judgment against the taxpayer, including one ordering the
            
52

    
payment of a fine or of restitution to a victim under Title 77, Chapter 38a, Crime Victims
            
53

    
Restitution Act, obtained through due process of law by any entity of state government; or
            
54

    
    (ii) any child support obligation which is due or past due, as determined by the Office
            
55

    
of Recovery Services in the Department of Human Services and after notice and an opportunity
            
56

    
for an adjudicative proceeding, as provided in Subsection (2); or
            
57

    
    (c)  as bail, to ensure the appearance of the taxpayer before the appropriate authority to

            
58


    
resolve an outstanding warrant against the taxpayer for which bail is due, if a court of
            
59

    
competent jurisdiction has not approved an alternative form of payment.  This bail may be
            
60

    
applied to any fine or forfeiture which is due and related to a warrant which is outstanding on
            
61

    
or after February 16, 1984, and in accordance with Subsections (3) and (4).
            
62

    
    (2) (a)  Subsection (1)(b)(ii) may be exercised only if the Office of Recovery Services
            
63

    
has sent written notice to the taxpayer's last-known address or the address on file under Section
            
64

    

62A-11-304.4

, stating:
            
65

    
    (i)  the amount of child support that is due or past due as of the date of the notice or
            
66

    
other specified date;
            
67

    
    (ii)  that any overpayment shall be applied to reduce the amount of due or past-due child
            
68

    
support specified in the notice; and
            
69

    
    (iii)  that the taxpayer may contest the amount of past-due child support specified in the
            
70

    
notice by filing a written request for an adjudicative proceeding with the office within 15 days
            
71

    
of the notice being sent.
            
72

    
    (b)  The Office of Recovery Services shall establish rules to implement this Subsection
            
73

    
(2), including procedures, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, to ensure
            
74

    
prompt reimbursement to the taxpayer of any amount of an overpayment of taxes which was
            
75

    
credited against a child support obligation in error, and to ensure prompt distribution of
            
76

    
properly credited funds to the obligee parent.
            
77

    
    (3)  Subsection (1)(c) may be exercised only if:
            
78

    
    (a)  a court has issued a warrant for the arrest of the taxpayer for failure to post bail,
            
79

    
appear, or otherwise satisfy the terms of a citation, summons, or court order; and
            
80

    
    (b)  a notice of intent to apply the overpayment as bail on the issued warrant has been
            
81

    
sent to the person's current address on file with the commission.
            
82

    
    (4) (a)  The commission shall deliver the overpayment applied as bail to the court that
            
83

    
issued the warrant of arrest.  The clerk of the court is authorized to endorse the check or
            
84

    
commission warrant of payment on behalf of the payees and deposit the monies in the court
            
85

    
treasury.

            
86


    
    (b)  The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the
            
87

    
warrant for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the
            
88

    
taxpayer is not required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar
            
89

    
amount of bail.  In all other cases, the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not
            
90

    
required to order the withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the 40-day
            
91

    
period, and the taxpayer may be arrested on the warrant.  [However, the bail amount shall be
            
92

    
reduced by the amount of tax overpayment received by the court.]
            
93

    
    (c)  If the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice described in Subsection (3), or to
            
94

    
resolve the warrant within 40 days after the notice was sent under that Subsection, the
            
95

    
overpayment applied as bail is forfeited and notice of the forfeiture shall be mailed to the
            
96

    
taxpayer at the current address on file with the commission.  The court may then issue another
            
97

    
warrant or allow the original warrant to remain in force if:
            
98

    
    (i)  the taxpayer has not complied with an order of the court;
            
99

    
    (ii)  the taxpayer has failed to appear and respond to a criminal charge for which a
            
100

    
personal appearance is required; or
            
101

    
    (iii)  the taxpayer has paid partial but not full bail in a case for which a personal
            
102

    
appearance is not required.
            
103

    
    (5)  If the alleged violations named in the warrant are later resolved in favor of the
            
104

    
taxpayer, the bail amount shall be remitted to the taxpayer.
            
105

    
    (6)  Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.
            
106

    
    (7) (a)  If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld
            
107

    
from wages exceeds the actual tax due, a refund or credit may not be made or allowed unless
            
108

    
the taxpayer or his legal representative files with the commission a tax return claiming the
            
109

    
refund or credit:
            
110

    
    (i)  within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension
            
111

    
of time for filing the return provided for in Subsection (7)(c); or
            
112

    
    (ii)  within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever period is later.
            
113

    
    (b) Except as provided in Subsection (7)(d), in other instances where a refund or credit

            
114


    
of tax which has not been deducted and withheld from income is due, a credit or refund may
            
115

    
not be allowed or made after three years from the time the tax was paid, unless, before the
            
116

    
expiration of the period, a claim is filed by the taxpayer or his legal representative.
            
117

    
    (c)  Beginning on July 1, 1998, the commission shall extend the period for a taxpayer to
            
118

    
file a claim under Subsection (7)(a)(i) if:
            
119

    
    (i)  the time period for filing a claim under Subsection (7)(a) has not expired; and
            
120

    
    (ii)  the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement:
            
121

    
    (A)  authorizing the extension; and
            
122

    
    (B)  providing for the length of the extension.
            
123

    
    (d)  Notwithstanding Subsection (7)(b), beginning on July 1, 1998, the commission
            
124

    
shall extend the period for a taxpayer to file a claim under Subsection (7)(b) if:
            
125

    
    (i)  the three-year period under Subsection (7)(b) has not expired; and
            
126

    
    (ii)  the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement:
            
127

    
    (A)  authorizing the extension; and
            
128

    
    (B)  providing for the length of the extension.
            
129

    
    (8)  The fine and bail forfeiture provisions of this section apply to all warrants and fines
            
130

    
issued in cases charging the taxpayer with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction described
            
131

    
in this section which are outstanding on or after February 16, 1984.
            
132

    
    (9)  If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the
            
133

    
tax to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.
            
134

    
    (10)  A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the
            
135

    
application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years
            
136

    
from the time the return was due for the taxable year of the loss.
            
137

    
    (11)  If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and
            
138

    
withheld under Section 

59-10-402

, a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent
            
139

    
that the amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.
            
140

    
    (12)  If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax,
            
141

    
the amount is an overpayment.

            
142


    
    (13)  If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable
            
143

    
period of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.
            
144

    
    (14) (a)  If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable
            
145

    
income reported on his federal income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is
            
146

    
treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes, or to
            
147

    
file an amended return with the commission, a claim for credit or refund of any resulting
            
148

    
overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the date the notice of
            
149

    
the change, correction, or amended return was required to be filed with the commission.
            
150

    
    (b)  If the report or amended return is not filed within 90 days, interest on any resulting
            
151

    
refund or credit ceases to accrue after the 90-day period.
            
152

    
    (c)  The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in
            
153

    
tax attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer's amended
            
154

    
federal income tax return.
            
155

    
    (d)  Except as specifically provided, this section does not affect the amount or the time
            
156

    
within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
            
157

    
    (15)  No credit or refund may be allowed or made if the overpayment is less than $1.
            
158

    
    (16)  The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the tax paid during the three
            
159

    
years immediately preceding the filing of the claim, or if no claim is filed, then during the three
            
160

    
years immediately preceding the allowance of the credit or refund.
            
161

    
    (17)  In the case of an overpayment of tax by the employer under the withholding
            
162

    
provisions of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent
            
163

    
that the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the
            
164

    
provisions of this chapter.
            
165

    
    (18)  If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under this chapter dies, the commission
            
166

    
may make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer's estate.  If
            
167

    
there is no executor or administrator, payment may be made to those persons who establish
            
168

    
entitlement to inherit the property of the decedent in the proportions set out in Title 75, Utah
            
169

482

    
accrued rent, utility charges, any late fee, and other costs, including attorney's fees, as provided
            
483

490

    
amount that is the probable amount of costs of suit and actual damages that may result to the
            
491

    
plaintiff if the defendant has improperly withheld possession.  The court shall consider prepaid
            
492

    
rent to the owner as a portion of the defendant's total bond.
            
493

    
    (c)  [The] If the defendant[, upon demand,] demands, within three days of being served

495

    
[to be held prior to the expiration of three days from the date the defendant is served with
            
496

    
notice of the filing of plaintiff's possession bond] within three days of the defendant's demand.
            
497

502

    
after the hearing that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of the property, the constable or
            
503

    
sheriff shall promptly return possession of the property to the plaintiff.  If at the hearing the

505

    
between the parties, the court shall require the defendant to post a bond as required in

507

    
adjudicated without further court proceedings, the court shall, upon adjudicating those issues,
            
508
