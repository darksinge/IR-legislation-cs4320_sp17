 Legislative Review Note
    as of   1-16-04  11:06 AM

This legislation authorizes a Choose Life special group license plate.  This legislation might be
challenged on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has not decided a case addressing the issuance
of special group license plates. However, at least one court has held that the issuance of a
special plate constitutes private speech that is unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination if the
license plate is issued pursuant to the uncontrolled discretion of the legislature.  Planned
Parenthood v. Rose, 236 F. Supp. 2d 564 (D.S.C. 2002);  See also, Sons of Confederate
Veterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, 288 F.3d 610
(4th Cir. 2002) .

This legislation also requires a contribution of at least $25 annually to Choose Life Utah, Inc., a
private non-profit entity, in order to qualify for a Choose Life license plate.  Article VI, Section
26 of the Utah Constitution prohibits special legislation.  The Utah Supreme Court has defined
special legislation as legislation that classifies its objects unreasonably, by selecting from a
class of particular persons, places, or things for the purpose of conferring privileges or
imposing burdens. It is unclear whether a court would determine that requiring a contribution
of at least $25 annually to Choose Life Utah, Inc. is unconstitutional special legislation.  If a
court finds that the classification is reasonable and that general legislation is unable to cover
the same issues that the special legislation covers, a court would likely uphold the Legislature's
action.
