 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-2-12  7:01 PM


As required by legislative rule and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General
Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its
own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill.  The note is based on an analysis of
relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill.  The note is not written for
the purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide
information relevant to the legislators' consideration of this bill.  The note is not a substitute
for the judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a
law in the context of a specific case.

This bill provides that, subject to certain exceptions, food grown by an individual and intended
for personal or family use is not subject to federal regulation.  In addition, this bill provides
that, subject to certain exceptions, food either grown or stored by an individual that is intended
for the individual's use or for use by the individual's family may not be confiscated by a
government entity. As drafted, this bill raises issues relating to the Supremacy Clause,
contained in Article VI of the United States Constitution.  The United States Supreme Court
has "long recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are 'without effect.'"  Altria
Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008), quoting Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725,
746 (1981).

The United States Supreme Court has held that the United States Congress has broad power to
regulate purely intrastate activity under the Commerce Clause of the United States
Constitution.  Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1, 18 (2005) (“Congress can regulate purely
intrastate activity . . . if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut
the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.”); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. 
Moreover, even if the growing and storing of food described in this bill is not considered
commercial activity, the Supreme Court has held that Congress may regulate intrastate activity
if it substantially affects interstate commerce.  United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 559
(1995).  Finally, the United States Supreme Court has explained that the regulation of
agricultural commodities is a fundamental example of what Congress may regulate under the
Commerce Clause.  Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942) (holding that Congress may
regulate wholly intrastate conduct_even the growing of wheat for consumption only by the
grower_if “it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.”). 

Based on this authority, to the extent this bill conflicts with federal regulation of commerce,
there is a high probability that a court would find that this legislation violates the Supremacy
Clause of the United States Constitution.
