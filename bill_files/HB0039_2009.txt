     34A-2-413.  Permanent total disability -- Amount of payments -- Rehabilitation.
            
67

    
    (1) (a)  In the case of a permanent total disability resulting from an industrial accident
            
68

    
or occupational disease, the employee shall receive compensation as outlined in this section.
            
69

    
    (b)  To establish entitlement to permanent total disability compensation, the employee
            
70

    
must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:
            
71

    
    (i)  the employee sustained a significant impairment or combination of impairments as a
            
72

    
result of the industrial accident or occupational disease that gives rise to the permanent total
            
73

    
disability entitlement;
            
74

    
    (ii)  the employee is permanently totally disabled; and
            
75

    
    (iii)  the industrial accident or occupational disease is the direct cause of the employee's
            
76

    
permanent total disability.
            
77

    
    (c)  To establish that an employee is permanently totally disabled the employee must
            
78

    
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that:
            
79

    
    (i)  the employee is not gainfully employed;
            
80

    
    (ii)  the employee has an impairment or combination of impairments that limit the
            
81

    
employee's ability to do basic work activities;
            
82

    
    (iii)  the industrial or occupationally caused impairment or combination of impairments

prevent the employee from performing the essential functions of the work activities for which
            
84

    
the employee has been qualified until the time of the industrial accident or occupational disease
            
85

    
that is the basis for the employee's permanent total disability claim; and
            
86

    
    (iv)  the employee cannot perform other work reasonably available, taking into
            
87

    
consideration the employee's:
            
88

    
    (A)  age;
            
89

    
    (B)  education;

93

    
    (d)  Evidence of an employee's entitlement to disability benefits other than those
            
94

    
provided under this chapter and Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act, if relevant:
            
95

    
    (i)  may be presented to the commission;
            
96

    
    (ii)  is not binding; and
            
97

    
    (iii)  creates no presumption of an entitlement under this chapter and Chapter 3, Utah
            
98

    
Occupational Disease Act.
            
99

    
    (e)  In determining under Subsections (1)(b) and (c) whether an employee cannot
            
100

    
perform other work reasonably available, the following may not be considered:
            
101

    
    (i)  whether the employee is incarcerated in a facility operated by or contracting with a

federal, state, county, or municipal government to house a criminal offender in either a secure
            
103

    
or nonsecure setting; or
            
104

    
    (ii)  whether the employee is not legally eligible to be employed because of a reason
            
105

    
unrelated to the impairment or combination of impairments.
            
106

    
    (2)  For permanent total disability compensation during the initial 312-week
            
107

    
entitlement, compensation is 66-2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage at the time of the

injury, limited as follows:

158

    
an employee receives compensation from the employer or the employer's insurance carrier for
            
159

    
any combination of disabilities amounting to 312 weeks of compensation at the applicable total
            
160

    
disability compensation rate, shall reduce the compensation payable:
            
161

    
    (i)  to the extent allowable by law;
            
162

    
    (ii)  by the dollar amount of 50% of the Social Security retirement benefits the
            
163

amount related to a cost-of-living increase to the Social Security retirement benefit that the
            
170

    
employee is first eligible to receive for a four week period, notwithstanding whether the
            
171

    
employee is injured on or before May 4, 2008.
            
172

    
    (ii)  For purposes of an employee whose compensation payable is reduced under this
            
173

    
Subsection (5) on or before May 4, 2008, the reduction is limited to the amount of the

    (6) (a)  A finding by the commission of permanent total disability is not final, unless
            
176

    
otherwise agreed to by the parties, until:
            
177

    
    (i)  an administrative law judge reviews a summary of reemployment activities
            
178

    
undertaken pursuant to Chapter [8] 8a, Utah Injured Worker Reemployment Act;
            
179

    
    (ii)  the employer or its insurance carrier submits to the administrative law judge:
            
180

    
    (A)  a reemployment plan as prepared by a qualified rehabilitation provider reasonably
            
181

    
designed to return the employee to gainful employment; or
            
182

    
    (B)  notice that the employer or its insurance carrier will not submit a plan; and

            
183


    
    (iii)  the administrative law judge, after notice to the parties, holds a hearing, unless
            
184

    
otherwise stipulated, to:
            
185

    
    (A)  consider evidence regarding rehabilitation; and
            
186

    
    (B)  review any reemployment plan submitted by the employer or its insurance carrier
            
187

    
under Subsection (6)(a)(ii).
            
188

    
    (b)  Before commencing the procedure required by Subsection (6)(a), the administrative
            
189

    
law judge shall order:
            
190

    
    (i)  the initiation of permanent total disability compensation payments to provide for the
            
191

    
employee's subsistence; and
            
192

    
    (ii)  the payment of any undisputed disability or medical benefits due the employee.
            
193

    
    (c)  Notwithstanding Subsection (6)(a), an order for payment of benefits described in
            
194

    
Subsection (6)(b) is considered a final order for purposes of Section 

34A-2-212

.
            
195

    
    (d)  The employer or its insurance carrier shall be given credit for any disability
            
196

    
payments made under Subsection (6)(b) against its ultimate disability compensation liability
            
197

    
under this chapter or Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act.
            
198

    
    (e)  An employer or its insurance carrier may not be ordered to submit a reemployment
            
199

    
plan.  If the employer or its insurance carrier voluntarily submits a plan, the plan is subject to
            
200

    
Subsections (6)(e)(i) through (iii).
            
201

    
    (i)  The plan may include, but not require an employee to pay for:
            
202

    
    (A)  retraining;
            
203

    
    (B)  education;
            
204

    
    (C)  medical and disability compensation benefits;
            
205

    
    (D)  job placement services; or
            
206

    
    (E)  incentives calculated to facilitate reemployment.
            
207

    
    (ii)  The plan shall include payment of reasonable disability compensation to provide
            
208

    
for the employee's subsistence during the rehabilitation process.
            
209

    
    (iii)  The employer or its insurance carrier shall diligently pursue the reemployment
            
210

    
plan.  The employer's or insurance carrier's failure to diligently pursue the reemployment plan
            
211

    
is cause for the administrative law judge on the administrative law judge's own motion to make
            
212

    
a final decision of permanent total disability.
            
213

    
    (f)  If a preponderance of the evidence shows that successful rehabilitation is not

            
214


    
possible, the administrative law judge shall order that the employee be paid weekly permanent
            
215

    
total disability compensation benefits.
            
216

    
    (g)  If a preponderance of the evidence shows that pursuant to a reemployment plan, as
            
217

    
prepared by a qualified rehabilitation provider and presented under Subsection (6)(e), an
            
218

    
employee could immediately or without unreasonable delay return to work but for the
            
219

    
following, an administrative law judge shall order that the employee be denied the payment of
            
220

    
weekly permanent total disability compensation benefits:
            
221

    
    (i)  incarceration in a facility operated by or contracting with a federal, state, county, or
            
222

    
municipal government to house a criminal offender in either a secure or nonsecure setting; or
            
223

    
    (ii)  not being legally eligible to be employed because of a reason unrelated to the
            
224

    
impairment or combination of impairments.
            
225

    
    (7) (a)  The period of benefits commences on the date the employee became
            
226

    
permanently totally disabled, as determined by a final order of the commission based on the
            
227

    
facts and evidence, and ends:
            
228

    
    (i)  with the death of the employee; or
            
229

    
    (ii)  when the employee is capable of returning to regular, steady work.
            
230

    
    (b)  An employer or its insurance carrier may provide or locate for a permanently totally
            
231

    
disabled employee reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work in a job earning at least
            
232

    
minimum wage, except that the employee may not be required to accept the work to the extent
            
233

    
that it would disqualify the employee from Social Security disability benefits.
            
234

    
    (c)  An employee shall:
            
235

    
    (i)  fully cooperate in the placement and employment process; and
            
236

    
    (ii)  accept the reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work.
            
237

    
    (d)  In a consecutive four-week period when an employee's gross income from the work
            
238

    
provided under Subsection (7)(b) exceeds $500, the employer or insurance carrier may reduce
            
239

    
the employee's permanent total disability compensation by 50% of the employee's income in
            
240

    
excess of $500.
            
241

    
    (e)  If a work opportunity is not provided by the employer or its insurance carrier, a
            
242

    
permanently totally disabled employee may obtain medically appropriate, part-time work
            
243

    
subject to the offset provisions of Subsection (7)(d).
            
244

    
    (f) (i)  The commission shall establish rules regarding the part-time work and offset.

            
245


    
    (ii)  The adjudication of disputes arising under this Subsection (7) is governed by Part
            
246

    
8, Adjudication.
            
247

    
    (g)  The employer or its insurance carrier has the burden of proof to show that
            
248

    
medically appropriate part-time work is available.
            
249

    
    (h)  The administrative law judge may:
            
250

    
    (i)  excuse an employee from participation in any work:
            
251

    
    (A)  that would require the employee to undertake work exceeding the employee's:
            
252

    
    (I)  medical capacity; or
            
253

    
    (II)  residual functional capacity; or
            
254

    
    (B)  for good cause; or
            
255

    
    (ii)  allow the employer or its insurance carrier to reduce permanent total disability
            
256

    
benefits as provided in Subsection (7)(d) when reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time
            
257

    
work is offered, but the employee fails to fully cooperate.
            
258

    
    (8)  When an employee is rehabilitated or the employee's rehabilitation is possible but
            
259

    
the employee has some loss of bodily function, the award shall be for permanent partial
            
260

    
disability.
            
261

    
    (9)  As determined by an administrative law judge, an employee is not entitled to
            
262

    
disability compensation, unless the employee fully cooperates with any evaluation or
            
263

    
reemployment plan under this chapter or Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act.  The
            
264

    
administrative law judge shall dismiss without prejudice the claim for benefits of an employee
            
265

    
if the administrative law judge finds that the employee fails to fully cooperate, unless the
            
266

    
administrative law judge states specific findings on the record justifying dismissal with
            
267

    
prejudice.
            
268

    
    (10) (a)  The loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of the following constitutes
            
269

    
total and permanent disability that is compensated according to this section:

273

    
    (iv)  both legs;
            
274

    
    (v)  both eyes; or
            
275

    
    (vi)  any combination of two body members described in this Subsection (10)(a).

            
276


    
    (b)  A finding of permanent total disability pursuant to Subsection (10)(a) is final.
            
277

    
    (11) (a)  An insurer or self-insured employer may periodically reexamine a permanent
            
278

    
total disability claim, except those based on Subsection (10), for which the insurer or
            
279

    
self-insured employer had or has payment responsibility to determine whether the employee
            
280

    
remains permanently totally disabled.
            
281

    
    (b)  Reexamination may be conducted no more than once every three years after an
            
282

    
award is final, unless good cause is shown by the employer or its insurance carrier to allow
            
283

    
more frequent reexaminations.
            
284

    
    (c)  The reexamination may include:
            
285

    
    (i)  the review of medical records;
            
286

    
    (ii)  employee submission to one or more reasonable medical evaluations;
            
287

    
    (iii)  employee submission to one or more reasonable rehabilitation evaluations and
            
288

    
retraining efforts;
            
289

    
    (iv)  employee disclosure of Federal Income Tax Returns;
            
290

    
    (v)  employee certification of compliance with Section 

34A-2-110

; and
            
291

    
    (vi)  employee completion of one or more sworn affidavits or questionnaires approved
            
292

    
by the division.
            
293

    
    (d)  The insurer or self-insured employer shall pay for the cost of a reexamination with
            
294

    
appropriate employee reimbursement pursuant to rule for reasonable travel allowance and per
            
295

    
diem as well as reasonable expert witness fees incurred by the employee in supporting the
            
296

    
employee's claim for permanent total disability benefits at the time of reexamination.
            
297

    
    (e)  If an employee fails to fully cooperate in the reasonable reexamination of a
            
298

    
permanent total disability finding, an administrative law judge may order the suspension of the
            
299

    
employee's permanent total disability benefits until the employee cooperates with the
            
300

    
reexamination.
            
301

    
    (f) (i) If the reexamination of a permanent total disability finding reveals evidence that
            
302

    
reasonably raises the issue of an employee's continued entitlement to permanent total disability
            
303

    
compensation benefits, an insurer or self-insured employer may petition the Division of
            
304

    
Adjudication for a rehearing on that issue.  The insurer or self-insured employer shall include
            
305

    
with the petition, documentation supporting the insurer's or self-insured employer's belief that
            
306

    
the employee is no longer permanently totally disabled.

            
307


    
    (ii)  If the petition under Subsection (11)(f)(i) demonstrates good cause, as determined
            
308

    
by the Division of Adjudication, an administrative law judge shall adjudicate the issue at a
            
309

    
hearing.
            
310

    
    (iii)  Evidence of an employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time work
            
311

    
may not be the sole basis for termination of an employee's permanent total disability
            
312

    
entitlement, but the evidence of the employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time
            
313

    
work under Subsection (7) may be considered in the reexamination or hearing with other
            
314

    
evidence relating to the employee's status and condition.
            
315

    
    (g)  In accordance with Section 

34A-1-309

, the administrative law judge may award
            
316

    
reasonable attorney fees to an attorney retained by an employee to represent the employee's
            
317

    
interests with respect to reexamination of the permanent total disability finding, except if the
            
318

    
employee does not prevail, the attorney fees shall be set at $1,000.  The attorney fees awarded
            
319

    
shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier in addition to the permanent total
            
320

    
disability compensation benefits due.
            
321

    
    (h)  During the period of reexamination or adjudication, if the employee fully
            
322

    
cooperates, each insurer, self-insured employer, or the Employers' Reinsurance Fund shall
            
323

    
continue to pay the permanent total disability compensation benefits due the employee.
            
324

    
    (12)  If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision to any person
            
325

    
or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this section is given effect without the invalid
