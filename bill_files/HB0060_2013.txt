99

    
provide safe, reliable, adequate, and efficient service to the customers of the public utility.
            
100

    
    (5)  The written decision shall leave to the local government any issue that does not
            
101

    
affect the provision of safe, reliable, adequate, and efficient service to customers of the public
            
102

    
utility or that does not involve an estimated excess cost.
            
103

    
    (6)  With respect to local government requirements or conditions that impose an
            
104

    
estimated excess cost but do not impair the provision of safe, reliable, and adequate service to
            
105

    
the customers of the public utility, the written decision shall leave each siting issue to the local

authorization, approval, exception, or waiver in a timely manner, the board shall allow
            
114

    
sufficient time for the local government to pay any actual excess cost that may be imposed as a
            
115

    
result of requirements or conditions the local government has imposed that do not impair the
            
116

    
provision of safe, reliable, and adequate service to customers of the public utility.
            
117

    
    (c)  There is a presumption that the utility has sought a permit, authorization, approval,

     54-18-305.  Appeal of high voltage power line route.
            
124

    
    This [section] chapter does not affect a public utility's or local government's right to

appeal a high voltage power line route to the Utility Facility Review Board in accordance with
