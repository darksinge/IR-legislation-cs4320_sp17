    (1)  Article I.  Purposes and Authorities.
            
1493

    
    (1) (a)  This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member
            
1494

    
states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states.  For the purposes of this
            
1495

    
agreement, the term "states" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto
            
1496

    
Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.
            
1497

    
    (b)  The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states
            
1498

    
entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the
            
1499

    
governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard,
            
1500

    
man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders,
            
1501

    
insurgency, or enemy attack.
            
1502

    
    (c)  This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related
            
1503

    
exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating
            
1504

    
performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of
            
1505

    
party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency
            
1506

    
periods.  Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' national guard
            
1507

    
forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual
            
1508

    
agreement between states.
            
1509

    
    (2)  Article II.  General Implementation.
            
1510

    
    (2) (a)  Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies
            
1511

    
transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is
            
1512

    
essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact.  Each state further
            
1513

    
recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present
            
1514

    
procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an
            
1515

    
emergency.  This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need

            
1516


    
in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies
            
1517

    
exist.
            
1518

    
    (b)  The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states,
            
1519

    
including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source,
            
1520

    
that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or
            
1521

    
disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this
            
1522

    
compact shall be understood.
            
1523

    
    (c)  On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally
            
1524

    
designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be
            
1525

    
responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures
            
1526

    
necessary to implement this compact.
            
1527

    
    (3)  Article III.  Party State Responsibilities.
            
1528

    
    (3) (a)  It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans

1568

    
resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is

1575

    
services.  Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular
            
1576

    
leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency
            
1577

    
services authorities of the state receiving assistance.  These conditions may be activated, as

            
1578

1579

1585

    
party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or
            
1586

    
other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person
            
1587

    
shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid
            
1588

    
involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and
            
1589

to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of
            
1596

    
such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or
            
1597

    
supplies in connection therewith.  Good faith in this article shall not include willful

    (7)  Article VII.  Supplementary Agreements.
            
1600

    
    Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid
            
1601

    
among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this
            
1602

    
instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein
            
1603

    
contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another
            
1604

    
state or affect any other agreements already in force between states.  Supplementary agreements
            
1605

    
may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured

1611

    
of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant
            
1612

    
to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were
            
1613

    
sustained within their own state.
            
1614

    
    (9)  Article IX.  Reimbursement.
            
1615

    
    Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be
            
1616

    
reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred
            
1617

    
in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for
            
1618

    
aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party
            
1619

    
state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan
            
1620

    
such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and
            
1621

    
provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements
            
1622

    
establishing a different allocation of costs among those states.  Article VIII expenses shall not
            
1623

    
be reimbursable under this provision.
            
1624

    
    (10)  Article X.  Evacuation.
            
1625

    
    (10) (a)  Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the
            
1626

    
civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so
            
1627

    
warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency
            
1628

    
management or services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident
            
1629

    
requiring evacuations might occur.
            
1630

    
    (b)  Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees
            
1631

    
come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be

    (c)  Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state
            
1637

    
from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket
            
1638

    
expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for
            
1639

    
transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items.  Such expenditures

            
1640


    
shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come.  After the
            
1641

    
termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall
            
1642

    
assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.
            
1643

1646

    
enactment by such state.
            
1647

    
    (b)  Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the

1649

    
withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other
            
1650

    
party states.  Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed
            
1651

    
hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
            
1652

    
    (c)  Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as
