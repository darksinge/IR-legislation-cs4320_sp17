Section  
9-13-102

 is enacted to read:
            

    
     9-13-102.  Legislative findings.
            

    
    (1) (a)  The corporation is created with the primary purpose of supporting the development
            

    
of qualifying businesses with loans through a revolving loan fund which includes corporate monies.
            

    
    (b)  The corporation is created for this purpose because the Legislature finds that:
            

    
    (i)  the growth of small businesses that develop qualifying products and services is necessary
            

    
to ensure:
            

    
    (A)  adequate employment for the state's citizens;
            

    
    (B)  growth and vitality of the state's economy; and
            

    
    (C)  diversity critical to the health and strength of the economy throughout the state; and
            

    
    (ii)  financial resources in this state are not adequate to support small businesses developing

- 6 -

            

    
qualifying products or services.
            

    
    (2) (a)  In addition to the primary purpose described in Subsection (1)(a) and from monies
            

    
other than corporate monies, the corporation may support the development of small businesses in
            

    
Utah through:
            

    
    (i)  helping small businesses obtain loans, grants, and other forms of assistance from private
            

    
and other public sources;
            

    
    (ii)  administering funds and programs on behalf of other public entities; and
            

    
    (iii)  qualifying for grants and loans from public and private entities to be used to provide
            

    
financing for small businesses.
            

    
    (b)  The corporation is permitted to engage in the activities described in Subsection (2)(a)
            

    
because the Legislature finds:
            

    
    (i) (A)  funds are available to help finance economic development loan programs;
            

    
    (B)  the state may not be eligible to receive the funds described in Subsection (2)(b)(i)(A);
            

    
and
            

    
    (C)  an organization such as an independent public corporation permits the state and its
            

    
citizens to receive the full benefit from the funds described in Subsection (2)(b)(i)(A); and
            

    
    (ii) (A)  many political subdivisions and other public entities qualify for funds for loan
            

    
programs, but lack the resources and expertise to administer a loan program in the most efficient and
            

    
cost-effective manner; and
            

    
    (B)  the entities described in Subsection (2)(b)(ii)(A) are aided by establishing an
            
    
independent
            

    
public corporation that can assist with the administration of those loan programs.
            

    
    (3)  By creating the corporation as an independent public corporation:
            

    
    (a)  the Legislature intends that the state be protected from potential liability for claims
            

    
against the corporation; and
            

    
    (b)  the corporation can qualify for certain grants, loans, and other forms of assistance from
            

    
the federal government and other sources for which the state itself is not eligible.
