1023

    
seller's business are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month or quarterly period
            
1024

    
will impose unnecessary hardships, the commission may accept reports at intervals that will, in
            
1025

    
the commission's opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer or seller and will not
            
1026

    
jeopardize collection of the tax.
