    (6) (a) (i)  The prosecutor may make written application to any district court showing a
            
70

    
reasonable likelihood that publicly releasing information about the identity of a witness or the
            
71

    
substance of the evidence resulting from a subpoena or interrogation would pose a threat of
            
72

    
harm to a person or otherwise impede the investigation.
            
73

    
    (ii)  Upon a finding of reasonable likelihood, the court may order the:

75

the person subpoenaed, and the substance of the evidence obtained be kept secret; and
            
77

    
    (C)  record of testimony and other subpoenaed evidence be kept secret unless the court
            
78

    
for good cause otherwise orders.

    (i)  the attorneys representing the state and members of their staffs;
            
82

    
    (ii)  persons who, in the judgment of the attorneys representing the state, are reasonably
            
83

    
necessary to assist in the investigative process;
            
84

    
    (iii)  the court reporter or operator of the electronic recording device; and
            
85

    
    (iv)  the attorney for the witness.
            
86

    
    (c)  This chapter does not prevent attorneys representing the state or members of their
            
87

    
staff from disclosing information obtained pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of furthering
            
88

    
any official governmental investigation.
            
89

    
    (d) (i)  If a secrecy order has been granted by the court regarding the interrogation or

            
90


    
disclosure of evidence by a witness under this subsection, and if the court finds a further
            
91

    
restriction on the witness is appropriate, the court may order the witness not to disclose the
            
92

    
substance of the witness's testimony or evidence given by the witness to others.
            
93

    
    (ii)  Any order to not disclose made under this subsection shall be served with the
            
94

96

    
the existence of the investigation to others.
            
97

    
    (iv)  Any order under this Subsection (6)(d) must be based upon a finding by the court
            
98

    
that one or more of the following risks exist:
            
99

    
    (A)  disclosure by the witness would cause destruction of evidence;
            
100

    
    (B)  disclosure by the witness would taint the evidence provided by other witnesses;
            
101

    
    (C)  disclosure by the witness to a target of the investigation would result in flight or
            
102

    
other conduct to avoid prosecution;
            
103

    
    (D)  disclosure by the witness would damage a person's reputation; or
            
104

    
    (E)  disclosure by the witness would cause a threat of harm to any person.
            
105

    
    (e) (i)  If the court imposes an order under Subsection (6)(d) authorizing an instruction
            
106

    
to a witness not to disclose the substance of testimony or evidence provided and the
            
107

    
prosecuting agency proves by a preponderance of the evidence that a witness has violated that
            
108

    
order, the court may hold the witness in contempt.
            
109

    
    (ii)  An order of secrecy imposed on a witness under this Subsection (6)(e) may not
            
110

    
infringe on the attorney-client relationship between the witness and the witness's attorney or on
            
111

    
any other legally recognized privileged relationship.
            
112

    
    (7) (a) (i)  The prosecutor may submit to any district court a separate written request
            
113

    
that the application, statement of good cause, and the court's order authorizing the investigation
            
114

    
be kept secret.
            
115

    
    (ii)  The request for secrecy is a public record under Title 63G, Chapter 2, Government
            
116

    
Records Access and Management Act, but need not contain any information that would
            
117

    
compromise any of the interest listed in Subsection (7)(c).
            
118

    
    (b)  With the court's permission, the prosecutor may submit to the court, in camera, any
            
119

    
additional information to support the request for secrecy if necessary to avoid compromising
            
120

    
the interests listed in Subsection (7)(c).

            
121


    
    (c)  The court shall consider all information in the application and order authorizing the
            
122

    
investigation and any information received in camera and shall order that all information be
            
123

    
placed in the public file except information that, if disclosed, would pose:
            
124

    
    (i)  a substantial risk of harm to a person's safety;
            
125

    
    (ii)  a clearly unwarranted invasion of or harm to a person's reputation or privacy; or
            
126

    
    (iii)  a serious impediment to the investigation.
            
127

    
    (d)  Before granting an order keeping secret documents and other information received
            
128

    
under this section, the court shall narrow the secrecy order as much as reasonably possible in
            
129

    
order to preserve the openness of court records while protecting the interests listed in
            
130

    
Subsection (7)(c).
            
131

    
    Section 2.   Effective date.
            
132

    
    If approved by two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, this bill takes effect
            
133

    
upon approval by the governor, or the day following the constitutional time limit of Utah
