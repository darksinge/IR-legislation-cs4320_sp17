     59-10-540.  Transferees.
            
276

    
    (1)  The liability at law or in equity of a transferee of property of any person liable in
            
277

    
respect of any tax (including additions to tax, penalties or interest) imposed by this chapter,
            
278

    
shall be assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions
            
279

    
and limitations as in the case of the tax to which the liability relates, except that the period of
            
280

    
limitations for assessment against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each
            
281

    
successive transfer, in order of transfer (from the person originally liable to the transferee

            
282


    
involved), but not by more than three years in the aggregate.   As used in this section,
            
283

    
"transferee" includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee, and distributee.
            
284

    
    (2)  (a)  If, before the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment of liability
            
285

    
of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the commission in any court against the person
            
286

    
originally liable or the last preceding transferee, based upon the liability of the person
            
287

    
originally liable, then the period of limitation for assessment of liability of the transferee shall
            
288

    
in no event expire prior to one year after such claim has been finally allowed, disallowed, or
            
289

    
otherwise disposed of.

    (b)  If, before expiration of the time prescribed in Subsection (1) or (2)(a) for the
            
291

    
assessment of the liability, the commission and the transferee have both consented in writing to
            
292

    
its assessment after such time, the liability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration
            
293

    
of the period agreed upon.  The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent
            
294

295

    
purpose of determining the period of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of
            
296

    
overpayments of tax made by such transferee or overpayments of tax made by the transferor as
            
297

299

    
the agreement is executed after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against

the original taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under Section 

59-10-529

 on the amount
            
301

    
of the credit or refund, the periods specified in Section 

59-10-529

 shall be increased by the
            
302

    
period from the date of such expiration to the date of the agreement.
            
303

    
    (3)  If any person is deceased, the period of limitation for assessment against him shall
            
304

    
be the period that would be in effect if he had lived.
            
305

    
    (4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section [

59-10-545

]

306
