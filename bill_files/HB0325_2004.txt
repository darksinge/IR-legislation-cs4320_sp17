30

    
    (i)  name the motor vehicle owner or operator in whose name the policy was purchased,
            
31

33

    
    (ii) (A)  if it is an owner's policy, designate by appropriate reference all the motor

ownership, maintenance, or use of these motor vehicles within the United States and Canada,
            
39

    
subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, for each motor vehicle, in amounts not less

than the minimum limits specified under Section 

31A-22-304

; or
            
41

    
    (B)  if it is an operator's policy, insure the person named as insured against loss from
            
42

    
the liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the insured's use of any motor
            
43

    
vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and with the same limits of liability
            
44

    
as in an owner's policy under Subsection (1)(ii)(A);
            
45

    
    (iii)  except as provided in Subsection (7), insure persons related to the named insured

47

    
household, including those who usually make their home in the same household but
            
48

    
temporarily live elsewhere, to the same extent as the named insured and the available coverage
            
49

    
of the policy may not be reduced to the persons described in this Subsection (1)(a)(iii) because:
            
50

    
    (A)  a permissive user driving a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident;
            
51

    
or
            
52

    
    (B)  the named insured or any of the persons described in this Subsection (1)(a)(iii)

    (iv)  cover damages or injury resulting from a covered driver of a motor vehicle who is

stricken by an unforeseeable paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition and who is not
            
56

    
reasonably aware that paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition is about to occur to the
            
57

    
extent that a person of ordinary prudence would not attempt to continue driving.
            
58

    
    (b)  The driver's liability under Subsection (1)(a)(iv) is limited to the insurance

            
59


    
coverage.
            
60

    
    (2) (a)  A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection
            
61

    

31A-22-302

(1)(a) may:
            
62

    
    (i)  provide for the prorating of the insurance under that policy with other valid and
            
63

    
collectible insurance;
            
64

    
    (ii)  grant any lawful coverage in addition to the required motor vehicle liability
            
65

    
coverage;
            
66

    
    (iii)  if the policy is issued to a person other than a motor vehicle business, limit the
            
67

    
coverage afforded to a motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the
            
68

    
minimum limits under Section 

31A-22-304

, and to those instances when there is no other valid
            
69

    
and collectible insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary,
            
70

    
excess, or contingent; and
            
71

    
    (iv)  if issued to a motor vehicle business, restrict coverage afforded to anyone other
            
72

    
than the motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits
            
73

    
under Section 

31A-22-304

, and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible
            
74

    
insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or
            
75

    
contingent.
            
76

    
    (b) (i)  The liability insurance coverage of a permissive user of a motor vehicle owned
            
77

    
by a motor vehicle business shall be primary coverage.
            
78

    
    (ii)  The liability insurance coverage of a motor vehicle business shall be secondary to
            
79

    
the liability insurance coverage of a permissive user as specified under Subsection (2)(b)(i).
            
80

    
    (3)  Motor vehicle liability coverage need not insure any liability:
            
81

    
    (a)  under any workers' compensation law under Title 34A, Utah Labor Code;
            
82

    
    (b)  resulting from bodily injury to or death of an employee of the named insured, other
            
83

    
than a domestic employee, while engaged in the employment of the insured, or while engaged
            
84

    
in the operation, maintenance, or repair of a designated vehicle; or
            
85

    
    (c)  resulting from damage to property owned by, rented to, bailed to, or transported by
            
86

    
the insured.
            
87

    
    (4)  An insurance carrier providing motor vehicle liability coverage has the right to
            
88

    
settle any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount
            
89

    
of the settlement is deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section 

31A-22-304

.

            
90


    
    (5)  A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage imposes on the insurer the
            
91

    
duty to defend, in good faith, any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit
            
92

    
seeking damages which would be payable under the policy.
            
93

    
    (6) (a)  If a policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage provides an insurer with
            
94

    
the defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured, that defense is not effective
            
95

    
against a third person making a claim against the insurer, unless there was collusion between
            
96

    
the third person and the insured.
            
97

    
    (b)  If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant, after
            
98

    
payment, the insurer is subrogated to the injured person's claim against the insured to the extent
            
99

    
of the payment and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has
            
100

    
been made whole with respect to the claim against the insured.
            
101

    
    (7)  A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection 

31A-22-302

(1) may
            
102

    
specifically exclude from coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured's
            
103

    
household, including a person who usually makes his home in the same household but
            
104

    
temporarily lives elsewhere, if:
            
105

    
    (a)  at the time of the proposed exclusion, each person excluded from coverage satisfies
            
106

    
the owner's or operator's security requirement of Section 

41-12a-301

, independently of the
            
107

    
named insured's proof of owner's or operator's security;
            
108

    
    (b)  the named insured and the person excluded from coverage each provide written
            
109

    
consent to the exclusion; and
            
110

    
    (c)  the insurer includes the name of each person excluded from coverage in the
            
111

    
evidence of insurance provided to an additional insured or loss payee.
            
112

    
    (8)  A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage may limit coverage to the policy
            
113

    
minimum limits under Section 

31A-22-304

 if the insured motor vehicle is operated by a person
            
114

    
who has consumed any alcohol or any illegal drug or illegal substance if the policy or a
            
115

    
specifically reduced premium was extended to the insured upon express written declaration
            
116

    
executed by the insured that the insured motor vehicle would not be so operated.
            
117

    
    (9) (a)  When a claim is brought exclusively by a named insured or a person described
            
118

    
in Subsection (1)(a)(iii) and asserted exclusively against a named insured or an individual
            
119

    
described in Subsection (1)(a)(iii), the claimant may elect to resolve the claim:
            
120

    
    (i)  by submitting the claim to binding arbitration; or

            
121


    
    (ii)  through litigation.
            
122

    
    (b)  Once the claimant has elected to commence litigation under Subsection (9)(a)(ii),
            
123

    
the claimant may not elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration under this section
            
124

    
without the written consent of both parties and the defendant's liability insurer.
            
125

    
    (c) (i)  Unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties, a claim that is submitted to
            
126

    
binding arbitration under Subsection (9)(a)(i) shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators.
            
127

    
    (ii)  Unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties, each party shall select an
            
128

    
arbitrator.  The arbitrators selected by the parties shall select a third arbitrator.
            
129

    
    (d)  Unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties, each party will pay the fees
            
130

    
and costs of the arbitrator that party selects.  Both parties shall share equally the fees and costs
            
131

    
of the third arbitrator.
            
132

    
    (e)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, an arbitration procedure conducted
            
133

    
under this section shall be governed by Title 78 Chapter 31a, Utah Uniform Arbitration Act,
            
134

    
unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties.
            
135

    
    (f) (i)  Discovery shall be conducted in accordance with Rules 26b through 36, Utah
            
136

    
Rules of Civil Procedure.
            
137

    
    (ii)  All issues of discovery shall be resolved by the arbitration panel.
            
138

    
    (g)  A written decision of two of the three arbitrators shall constitute a final decision of
            
139

    
the arbitration panel.
            
140

    
    (h)  Prior to the rendering of the arbitration award:
            
141

    
    (i)  the existence of a liability insurance policy may be disclosed to the arbitration
            
142

    
panel; and
            
143

    
    (ii)  the amount of all applicable liability insurance policy limits may not be disclosed to
            
144

    
the arbitration panel.
            
145

    
    (i)  The amount of the arbitration award may not exceed the liability limits of all the
            
146

    
defendant's applicable liability insurance policies, including applicable liability umbrella
            
147

    
policies.  If the initial arbitration award exceeds the liability limits of all applicable liability
            
148

    
insurance policies, the arbitration award shall be reduced to an amount equal to the liability
            
149

    
limits of all applicable liability insurance policies.
            
150

    
    (j)  The arbitration award is the final resolution of all claims between the parties unless
            
151

    
the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means.

            
152


    
    (k)  If the arbitration panel finds that the action was not brought, pursued, or defended
            
153

    
in good faith, the arbitration panel may award reasonable fees and costs against the party that
            
154

    
failed to bring, pursue, or defend the claim in good faith.
            
155

    
    (l)  Nothing in this section is intended to limit any claim under any other portion of an
            
156

    
applicable insurance policy.
            
157

    
    (10)  An insurer issuing a policy of insurance under this part that is covering an at-fault
            
158

    
driver may not reduce compensation to an injured party based on the injured party not being
            
159

    
covered by a policy of insurance that provides personal injury protection coverage under
            
160
