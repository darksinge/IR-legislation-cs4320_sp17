(1), if the minor who is
            
533

    
the subject of the petition is not in the protective custody of the division, a court may order that
            
534

    
the minor be removed from the minor's home or otherwise taken into protective custody if the

has occurred involving the same alleged abuser or under similar circumstance as the previous
            
542

543

    
custody of the minor's parent];
            
544

    
    (b)  a parent or guardian engages in or threatens the minor with unreasonable conduct

that causes the minor to suffer emotional damage and there are no reasonable means available

558

    
failed to protect the minor by allowing the minor to be in the physical presence of the alleged

physically or sexually abused;]

 DCFS custody.
            
624

    
    (1) (a)  At the shelter hearing, when the court orders that a child be removed from the
            
625

    
custody of his parent in accordance with the requirements of Section 

78-3a-306

, the court shall
            
626

    
first determine whether there is another natural parent as defined in Subsection (1)(b), with
            
627

    
whom the child was not residing at the time the events or conditions that brought him within
            
628

    
the court's jurisdiction occurred, who desires to assume custody of the child.  If that parent
            
629

    
requests custody, the court shall place the minor with that parent unless it finds that the
            
630

    
placement would be unsafe or otherwise detrimental to the child.  The provisions of this
            
631

    
Subsection (1) are limited by the provisions of Subsection (8)(b).
            
632

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 

78-3a-103

, for purposes of this section
            
633

    
"natural parent" includes only a biological or adoptive mother, an adoptive father, or a
            
634

    
biological father who was married to the child's biological mother at the time the child was
            
635

    
conceived or born, or who has strictly complied with the provisions of Section 

78-30-4.14

 prior
            
636

    
to removal of the child or voluntary surrender of the child by the custodial parent.  This
            
637

    
definition applies regardless of whether the child has been or will be placed with adoptive
            
638

    
parents or whether adoption has been or will be considered as a long term goal for the child.
            
639

    
    (c) (i)  The court shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that parent to
            
640

    
assume custody, and the safety and appropriateness of the placement.
            
641

    
    (ii)  The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to visit the parent's home,
            
642

    
perform criminal background checks described in Sections 

78-3a-307.1

 and 

62A-4a-202.4

, and
            
643

    
check the division's management information system for any previous reports of abuse or
            
644

    
neglect received by the division regarding the parent at issue.
            
645

    
    (iii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any
            
646

    
further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.
            
647

    
    (iv)  The division shall report its findings in writing to the court.

            
648


    
    (v)  The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending its
            
649

    
determination regarding that placement.
            
650

    
    (2)  If the court orders placement with a parent under Subsection (1), the child and the
            
651

    
parent are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may order that the parent
            
652

    
assume custody subject to the supervision of the court, and order that services be provided to
            
653

    
the parent from whose custody the child was removed, the parent who has assumed custody, or
            
654

    
both.  The court shall also provide for reasonable parent-time with the parent from whose
            
655

    
custody the child was removed, unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the child.  The
            
656

    
court's order shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether:
            
657

    
    (a)  placement with the parent continues to be in the child's best interest;
            
658

    
    (b)  the child should be returned to the original custodial parent;
            
659

    
    (c)  the child should be placed with a relative, pursuant to Subsection (5); or
            
660

    
    (d)  the child should be placed in the custody of the division.
            
661

    
    (3)  The time limitations described in Section 

78-3a-311

 with regard to reunification
            
662

    
efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with
            
663

    
Subsection (1).
            
664

    
    (4)  Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection (1)
            
665

    
or (2).  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition
            
666

    
that court for modification of the order.
            
667

    
    (5) (a) (i)  If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of
            
668

    
his parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at that time,
            
669

    
determine whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child.
            
670

    
    (ii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a
            
671

    
reasonable search to determine whether there are relatives of the child who are willing and
            
672

    
appropriate, in accordance with the requirements of this part and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Part 2,
            
673

    
Child Welfare Services, for placement of the child.  The court shall order the parents to
            
674

    
cooperate with the division, within five working days, to provide information regarding
            
675

    
relatives who may be able and willing to care for the child.
            
676

    
    (iii)  The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the division pending [that]
            
677

    
the determination under Subsection (5)(a)(ii).
            
678

    
    (iv)  This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an identified relative will

            
679


    
receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration [may] shall be given to a
            
680

    
relative's request for placement of the child, if it is in the best interest of the child, and the
            
681

    
provisions of this section are satisfied.
            
682

    
    (b) (i)  If a willing relative is identified pursuant to Subsection (5)(a), the court shall
            
683

    
make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative to assume custody, and the safety
            
684

    
and appropriateness of placement with that relative.  In order to be considered a "willing
            
685

    
relative" under this section, the relative shall be willing to cooperate if the child's permanency
            
686

    
goal is reunification with his parent or parents, and be willing to adopt or take permanent
            
687

    
custody of the child if that is determined to be in the best interest of the child.
            
688

    
    (ii)  The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to conduct criminal background
            
689

    
checks described in Sections 

78-3a-307.1

 and 

62A-4a-202.4

, visit the relative's home, check
            
690

    
the division's management information system for any previous reports of abuse or neglect
            
691

    
regarding the relative at issue, report its findings in writing to the court, and provide sufficient
            
692

    
information so that the court may determine whether:
            
693

    
    (A)  the relative has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other children
            
694

    
that may indicate or present a danger to this child;
            
695

    
    (B)  the child is comfortable with the relative;
            
696

    
    (C)  the relative recognizes the parent's history of abuse and is determined to protect the
            
697

    
child;
            
698

    
    (D)  the relative is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent for
            
699

    
access to the child, in accordance with court orders;
            
700

    
    (E)  the relative is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary; and
            
701

    
    (F)  the relative can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.
            
702

    
    (iii)  The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any
            
703

    
further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.
            
704

    
    (iv)  The division shall complete and file its assessment regarding placement with a
            
705

    
relative as soon as practicable, in an effort to facilitate placement of the child with a relative.
            
706

    
    (c)  The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the
            
707

    
division's investigation pursuant to Subsection (5)(b), and the court's determination regarding
            
708

    
that placement.  The court shall ultimately base its determination regarding placement with a
            
709

    
relative on the best interest of the child.

            
710


    
    (d)  For purposes of this section, "relative" means an adult who is a grandparent, great

grandparent, aunt, great aunt, uncle, great uncle, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepparent, first
            
712

713

    
the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. Section 1903, "relative" also means an "extended
            
714

    
family member" as defined by that statute.
            
715

    
    (6) (a)  When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative pursuant to
            
716

    
Subsection (5), it shall order that the relative assume custody subject to the continuing
            
717

    
supervision of the court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided to the minor
            
718

    
and the relative.  That child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the Division of
            
719

    
Child and Family Services.  The child and any relative with whom the child is placed are under
            
720

    
the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may enter any order that it considers
            
721

    
necessary for the protection and best interest of the child.  The court shall provide for
            
722

    
reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the child was removed
            
723

    
unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the child.
            
724

    
    (b) (i)  Placement with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5) shall be periodically
            
725

    
reviewed by the court, no less often than every six months, to determine whether:
            
726

    
    (A)  placement with the relative continues to be in the child's best interest;
            
727

    
    (B)  the child should be returned home; or
            
728

    
    (C)  the child should be placed in the custody of the division.
            
729

    
    (ii)  No later than 12 months after placement with a relative the court shall schedule a
            
730

    
hearing for the purpose of entering a permanent order in accordance with the best interest of the
            
731

    
child.
            
732

    
    (iii)  The time limitations described in Section 

78-3a-311

, with regard to reunification
            
733

    
efforts, apply to children placed with a relative pursuant to Subsection (5).
            
734

    
    (7)  When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of his parent and
            
735

    
does not vest custody in another parent or relative under this section, the court shall order that
            
736

    
the child be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, to
            
737

    
proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services in
            
738

    
accordance with this chapter and Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
739

    
    (8) (a)  Any preferential consideration that a relative [may be] is initially granted
            
740

    
pursuant to Subsection (5) expires 120 days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that

            
741


    
time period has expired, a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a
            
742

    
child, may not be granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.
            
743

    
    (b)  When the time period described in Subsection (8)(a) has expired, the preferential
            
744

    
consideration which [may] is initially [be] granted to a natural parent in accordance with
            
745

    
Subsection (1), is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best
            
746

    
interest of the child.
            
747

    
    Section 12.  
Section  
78-3a-311

 is amended to read:
            
748

    
     78-3a-311.  Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.
            
749

    
    (1)  The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section 

78-3a-118

, place
            
750

    
the child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency,
            
751

    
order protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or other
            
752

    
services.
            
753

    
    (2) (a) (i) Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing,
            
754

    
and that the minor remain in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, it shall
            
755

    
first establish a primary permanency goal for the minor and determine whether, in view of the
            
756

    
primary permanency goal, reunification services are appropriate for the child and the child's
            
757

    
family, pursuant to Subsection (3).
            
758

    
    (ii)  When the court determines that reunification services are appropriate for the child
            
759

    
and the child's family, the court shall provide for reasonable parent-time with the parent or
            
760

    
parents from whose custody the child was removed, unless parent-time is not in the best
            
761

    
interest of the child.
            
762

    
    (iii)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical abuse or
            
763

    
neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make "reasonable
            
764

    
efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to attempt to
            
765

    
rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  In all cases, the child's health, safety, and welfare
            
766

    
shall be the court's paramount concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify
            
767

    
should be made.
            
768

    
    (b) (i)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a
            
769

    
concurrent permanency goal.  The concurrent permanency goal shall include a representative
            
770

    
list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal will be abandoned in favor of
            
771

    
the concurrent permanency goal and an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying

            
772


    
the primary permanency goal.
            
773

    
    (ii)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection
            
774

    

78-3a-312

(1)(b) within 30 days if something other than reunification is initially established as a
            
775

    
child's primary permanency goal.
            
776

    
    (iii)  The court may amend a child's primary permanency goal before the establishment
            
777

    
of a final permanency plan under Section 

78-3a-312

.  The court is not limited to the terms of
            
778

    
the concurrent permanency goal in the event that the primary permanency goal is abandoned. 
            
779

    
If, at anytime, the court determines that reunification is no longer a child's primary permanency
            
780

    
goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312


            
781

    
within the earlier of 30 days of the court's determination or 12 months from the original
            
782

    
removal of the child.
            
783

    
    (c) (i)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order
            
784

    
that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and the child's parent
            
785

    
for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time. In
            
786

    
providing those services, the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the division's
            
787

    
paramount concern, and the court shall so order.
            
788

    
    (ii)  The court shall determine whether the services offered or provided by the division
            
789

    
under the treatment plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division.  The court
            
790

    
shall also determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the treatment plan in
            
791

    
accordance with Section 

62A-4a-205

.  Those duties and responsibilities shall be identified on
            
792

    
the record, for the purpose of assisting in any future determination regarding the provision of
            
793

    
reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and federal law.
            
794

    
    (iii)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the date
            
795

    
that the child was initially removed from the child's home.  Nothing in this section may be
            
796

    
construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12 months of reunification services.
            
797

    
    (iv)  If reunification services have been ordered, the court may terminate those services
            
798

    
at any time.
            
799

    
    (v)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to
            
800

    
be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection
            
801

    

78-3a-312

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance
            
802

    
with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the

            
803


    
permanent placement of the child.
            
804

    
    (d)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
805

    
described in Subsection (2)(c) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
806

    
    (e) (i)  If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be
            
807

    
conducted by the court in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

 at the expiration of the time
            
808

    
period for reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12
            
809

    
months after the original removal of the child.
            
810

    
    (ii)  If reunification services have not been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be
            
811

    
conducted within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

.
            
812

    
    (f)  With regard to a child who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the child is
            
813

    
initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
814

    
    (i)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
815

    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-312

; and
            
816

    
    (ii)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
817

    
removal of the child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to
            
818

    
comply with the treatment plan.
            
819

    
    (g)  With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have
            
820

    
been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period
            
821

    
of six months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate
            
822

    
reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental
            
823

    
rights.
            
824

    
    (3) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
825

    
permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
826

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may determine that
            
827

    
efforts to reunify a child with the child's family are not reasonable or appropriate, based on the
            
828

    
individual circumstances, and that reunification services should not be provided.  In
            
829

    
determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a child, and in making "reasonable
            
830

    
efforts," the child's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern.
            
831

    
    (b)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
832

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
833

    
circumstances exist:

            
834


    
    (i)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
835

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
836

    
    (ii)  the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders him
            
837

    
incapable of utilizing reunification services; that finding shall be based on competent evidence
            
838

    
from mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision of services, the
            
839

    
parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within 12 months;
            
840

    
    (iii)  the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or
            
841

    
sexual abuse, that following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of his
            
842

    
parent, was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the minor is being removed
            
843

    
due to additional physical or sexual abuse;
            
844

    
    (iv)  the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has
            
845

    
committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder or
            
846

    
manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide;
            
847

    
    (v)  the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
848

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
849

    
minor;
            
850

    
    (vi)  the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the
            
851

    
parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services
            
852

    
with the offending parent;
            
853

    
    (vii)  the parent's rights have been terminated with regard to any other child;
            
854

    
    (viii)  the child has been removed from his home on at least two previous occasions and
            
855

    
reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times; or
            
856

    
    (ix)  the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer; or
            
857

    
    (x)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
858

    
efforts or services.
            
859

    
    (4) (a)  Failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with any
            
860

    
previous treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the
            
861

    
influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, whether a parent continues to
            
862

    
live with an individual who abused the child, any patterns of the parent's behavior that have
            
863

    
exposed the child to repeated abuse, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent's
            
864

    
behavior is unlikely to be successful, shall be considered in determining whether reunification

            
865


    
services are appropriate.
            
866

    
    (b)  The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in
            
867

    
reunification with the child, in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.
            
868

    
    (5)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), and the
            
869

    
whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out-of-home placement of the
            
870

    
minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits
            
871

    
described in Subsection (2), however, are not tolled by the parent's absence.
            
872

    
    (6)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
873

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.  In
            
874

    
determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent-child
            
875

    
bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or
            
876

    
illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for minors ten years
            
877

    
of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services,
            
878

    
and any other appropriate factors.  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject
            
879

    
to the 12-month limitation imposed in Subsection (2).  Reunification services for an
            
880

    
institutionalized parent are subject to the 12-month limitation imposed in Subsection (2),
            
881

    
unless the court determines that continued reunification services would be in the child's best
            
882

    
interest.
            
883

    
    (7)  If, pursuant to Subsection (3)(b)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), or (x), the
            
884

    
court does not order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30
            
885

    
days, in accordance with Section 

78-3a-312

.
            
886

    
    Section 13.  
Section  
78-3a-314

 is amended to read:
            
887

    
     78-3a-314.  All proceedings -- Persons entitled to be present.
            
888

    
    (1)  A child who is the subject of a juvenile court hearing, any person entitled to notice
            
889

    
pursuant to Section 

78-3a-306

 or 

78-3a-309

, preadoptive parents, and any relative providing
            
890

    
care for the child, are entitled:
            
891

    
    (a)  to notice[,];

citizen reviews[,]; and [are entitled]
            
894

    
    (c)  to an opportunity to be heard.
            
895

    
    (2)  Because the child's foster parents have the right to notice, pursuant to Section

            
896


    

78-3a-309

, they have the right to be present at each and every hearing held under this part
            
897

    
including administrative and citizen reviews, and are entitled to an opportunity to be heard.
            
898

    
    (3)  [A] If the court appoints a guardian ad litem for a child, the child shall be
            
899

    
represented at each hearing by the guardian ad litem [appointed to his case by the court].  The
            
900

    
child has a right to be present at each hearing, subject to the discretion of the guardian ad litem,
            
901

    
if appointed, or the court regarding any possible detriment to the child.
            
902

    
    (4) (a)  The parent or guardian of a child who is the subject of a petition under this part
            
903

    
has the right to be represented by counsel, and to present evidence, at each hearing.
            
904

    
    (b)  When it appears to the court that a parent or guardian of the child desires counsel
            
905

    
but is financially unable to afford and cannot for that reason employ counsel, and the child has
            
906

    
been placed in out-of-home care, or the petitioner is recommending that the child be placed in
            
907

    
out-of-home care, the court shall appoint counsel.
            
908

    
    (5) (a)  In every abuse, neglect, or dependency proceeding under this chapter, the court
            
909

    
shall order that the child be represented by a guardian ad litem, in accordance with Section
            
910

    

78-3a-912

.
            
911

    
    (b)  The guardian ad litem shall represent the best interest of the child, in accordance
            
912

    
with the requirements of that section, at the shelter hearing and at all subsequent court and
            
913

    
administrative proceedings, including any proceeding for termination of parental rights in
            
914

    
accordance with Part 4, Termination of Parental Rights Act.
            
915

    
    (6) (a) (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, counsel for all parties to the
            
916

    
action shall be given access to all records, maintained by the division or any other state or local
            
917

    
public agency, that are relevant to the abuse, neglect, or dependency proceeding under this
            
918

    
chapter.
            
919

    
    (ii)  If the natural parent of a child is representing himself, [he] the natural parent of the
            
920

    
child shall have access to [those] the records described in Subsection (6)(a)(i).
            
921

    
    (b)  The [above] disclosures described in Subsection (6)(a) are not required in the

    (b) (i)  When the court appoints an attorney guardian ad litem under this section, the

1060

    
determines to be just and appropriate.
            
1061

    
    (ii)  The court may not assess those fees or costs against a legal guardian, when that
            
1062

    
guardian is the state, or against a parent who is found to be impecunious.  If a person claims to
            
1063

    
be impecunious, the court shall require of that person an affidavit of impecuniosity as provided
            
1064

    
in Section

1068

    
employee of the state for purposes of indemnification under Title 63, Chapter 30, Utah
            
1069

    
Governmental Immunity Act.
            
1070

    
    [(8)] (9) (a)  An attorney guardian ad litem shall represent the best interest of a minor. 
            
1071

    
If the minor's wishes differ from the attorney's determination of the minor's best interest, the
            
1072

    
attorney guardian ad litem shall communicate the minor's wishes to the court in addition to
            
1073

    
presenting the attorney's determination of the minor's best interest.  A difference between the
            
1074

    
minor's wishes and the attorney's determination of best interest may not be considered a
            
1075

    
conflict of interest for the attorney.
            
1076

    
    (b)  The court may appoint one attorney guardian ad litem to represent the best interests
            
1077

    
of more than one minor child of a marriage.
            
1078

    
    [(9)] (10)  An attorney guardian ad litem shall be provided access to all Division of
            
1079

    
Child and Family Services records regarding the minor at issue and the minor's family.
            
1080

    
    [(10)] (11)  An attorney guardian ad litem shall maintain current and accurate records
            
1081

    
regarding the number of times the attorney has had contact with each minor and the actions the

            
1082


    
attorney has taken in representation of the minor's best interest.
            
1083

    
    [(11)] (12) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection [(11)] (12)(b), all records of an
            
1084

    
attorney guardian ad litem are confidential and may not be released or made public upon
            
1085

    
subpoena, search warrant, discovery proceedings, or otherwise.  This subsection supersedes
            
1086

    
Title 63, Chapter 2, Government Records Access and Management Act.
            
1087

    
    (b)  All records of an attorney guardian ad litem are subject to legislative subpoena,
            
1088

    
under Title 36, Chapter 14, Legislative Subpoena Powers, and shall be released to the
            
1089

    
Legislature.
            
1090

    
    (c)  Records released in accordance with Subsection [(11)] (12)(b) shall be maintained
            
1091

    
as confidential by the Legislature.  The Office of the Legislative Auditor General may,
            
1092

    
however, include summary data and nonidentifying information in its audits and reports to the
            
1093

    
Legislature.
            
1094

    
    (d)  Because of the unique role of an attorney guardian ad litem described in Subsection
            
1095

    
[(8)] (9), and the state's role and responsibility to provide a guardian ad litem program and, as
            
1096

    
parens patriae, to protect minors, Subsection [(11)] (12)(b) constitutes an exception to Rules of
            
1097

    
Professional Conduct, Rule 1.6, as provided by Rule 1.6(b)(4).  A claim of attorney-client
            
1098

    
privilege does not bar access to the records of an attorney guardian ad litem by the Legislature,
            
1099

    
through legislative subpoena.
            
1100

    
    Section 16.

1106

    
a minor is at issue.  The attorney guardian ad litem shall be certified by the Director of the
            
1107

    
Office of the Guardian Ad Litem as having met the minimum qualifications for appointment,
            
1108

1109

    
    (b)  If an attorney guardian ad litem has been appointed for the minor in any prior or

1119

    
    (I)  the Office of the Guardian Ad Litem[.]; or
            
1120

    
    (II)  another attorney guardian ad litem; or
            
1121

    
    (B)  make no further appointment.

determines to be just.

    (b)  If the court finds a party to be impecunious, under the provisions of Section
            
1126

    

78-7-36

, the court may direct the impecunious party's share of the assessment to be covered by

    (c)  interview witnesses and review relevant records pertaining to the minor and the
