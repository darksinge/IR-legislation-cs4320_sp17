assure the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, that an adequate supply of decent, safe, and

sanitary housing is essential to the well-being of the citizens of the state, and that an adequate

supply of mortgage funds for housing at reasonable interest rates is in the public interest.
            
3131

    
    (2)  [It is found and declared] The Legislature finds and declares that:

restrict the transfer of existing housing and new housing starts[.];
            
3137

    
    [(3)] (c)  [It is found and declared that] the reduction in residential construction starts
            
3138

    
associated with the high rates causes a condition of substantial unemployment and
            
3139

    
underemployment in the construction industry which impedes the economy of the state and
            
3140

    [(a)] (d)  these conditions associated with the recurrent shortages of residential
            
3143

    
mortgage funds contribute to slums and blight in the cities and rural areas of the state and

ultimately to the deterioration of the quality of living conditions within the state; [and]
            
3145

governmental entities throughout Utah that are endeavoring to improve the availability of

housing for low and moderate income, but many of these organizations and entities lack
            
3160

    
expertise and financial resources to act efficiently and expeditiously in these efforts[.];
            
3161

    
    [(8)] (i)  [It is found and declared that] innovative programs that bring together
            
3162

    
resources from the public, nonprofit, and private sector are necessary in order to increase the
            
3163

    
supply of housing for low and moderate individuals, but these programs usually need advice
