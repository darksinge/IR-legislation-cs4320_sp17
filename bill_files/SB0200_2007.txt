116

    
    (f)  Laboratories conducting testing in accordance with this section shall implement a
            
117

    
quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure that will determine the

119

    
    (g)  This section does not require additional testing if cigarettes are tested consistent
            
120

    
with this part for any other purpose.

    (4)  A manufacturer of a cigarette that the state fire marshal determines cannot be tested
            
133

    
in accordance with the test method prescribed in Subsection (2)(a) shall propose a test method
            
134

    
and performance standard for the cigarette to the state fire marshal.  Upon approval of the
            
135

    
proposed test method and a determination by the state fire marshal that the performance
            
136

    
standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in
            
137

    
Subsection (2)(c), the manufacturer may employ such test method and performance standard to
            
138

    
certify such cigarette pursuant to Section 

53-7-404

.  If the state fire marshal determines that
            
139

    
another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test
            
140

    
method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this part, and the state
            
141

    
fire marshal finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have

            
142


    
approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular
            
143

    
cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the fire safety standards of that state's law or
            
144

    
regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section, then the state fire marshal shall
            
145

    
authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to
            
146

    
certify that cigarette for sale in this state, unless the state fire marshal demonstrates a
            
147

    
reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under this part.  All other
            
148

    
applicable requirements of this section shall apply to the manufacturer.
            
149

    
    (5)  Each manufacturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests conducted on all

available to the state fire marshal and the attorney general upon written request.  Any
            
152

    
manufacturer who fails to make copies of these reports available within 60 days of receiving a
            
153

    
written request shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each day after the

sixtieth day that the manufacturer does not make the copies available.
            
155

    
    (6)  The state fire marshal may adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for
            
156

    
Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes upon a finding that the subsequent method does
            
157

    
not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette
            
158

    
when compared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when
            
159

    
tested in accordance with ASTM Standard E2187-04 and the performance standard in
            
160

    
Subsection (2)(c).
            
161

    
    (7)  The state fire marshal shall review the effectiveness of this section and report every
            
162

    
three years to the Legislature the state fire marshal's findings and, if appropriate,

164

    
legislative recommendations shall be submitted no later than November 1, 2011 and every
            
165

    
November 1 of each three-year period thereafter.

    (8)  The requirements of Subsection (1) shall not prohibit wholesale or retail dealers
            
167

    
from selling their existing inventory of cigarettes on or after the effective date of this part if the
            
168

    
wholesale or retail dealer can establish that state tax stamps were affixed to the cigarettes prior
            
169

    
to the effective date, and if the wholesale or retail dealer can establish that the inventory was

            
170


    
purchased prior to the effective date in comparable quantity to the inventory purchased during
            
171

    
the same period of the prior year.
            
172

    
    (9)  This part shall be implemented in accordance with the implementation and
