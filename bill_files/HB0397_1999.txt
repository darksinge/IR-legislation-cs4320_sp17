For purposes of restitution,                            a victim has the meaning as defined in Subsection     e .                                 ii   In determining whether restitution is appropriate, the court shall follow the criteria and                            procedures as provided in Subsections     c  and     d .                                 iii   If the court finds the defendant owes restitution, the clerk of the court shall enter an                            order of complete restitution as defined in Subsection     b  on the civil judgment docket and                            provide notice of the order to the parties.                                 iv   The order is considered a legal judgment enforceable under the Utah Rules of Civil                            Procedure, and the person in whose favor the restitution order is entered may seek enforcement of                            the restitution order in accordance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

Interest shall accrue on the amount ordered from the time of sentencing.                                 vii   The Department of Corrections shall make rules permitting the restitution payments                            to be credited to principal first and the remainder of payments credited to interest in accordance                            with Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.                                 b   i   If a defendant has been extradited to this state under Title   , Chapter   ,                            Extradition, to resolve pending criminal charges and is convicted of criminal activity in the county                            to which he has been returned, the court may, in addition to any other sentence it may impose,                            order that the defendant make restitution for costs expended by any governmental entity for the                            extradition.                                 ii   In determining whether restitution is appropriate, the court shall consider the criteria                            in Subsection     c .                                 c   In determining restitution, the court shall determine complete restitution and                            court ordered restitution.                                 i   Complete restitution means the restitution necessary to compensate a victim for all                            losses caused by the defendant.                                 ii   Court ordered restitution means the restitution the court having criminal jurisdiction                            orders the defendant to pay as a part of the criminal sentence at the time of sentencing.                                 iii   Complete restitution and court ordered restitution shall be determined as provided in                            Subsection    .                                 d   i   If the court determines that restitution is appropriate or inappropriate under this                            subsection, the court shall make the reasons for the decision a part of the court record.                                 ii   In any civil action brought by a victim to enforce the judgment, the defendant shall be                            entitled to offset any amounts that have been paid as part of court ordered restitution to the victim.                                 iii   A judgment ordering restitution constitutes a lien when recorded in a judgment docket                               and shall have the same effect and is subject to the same rules as a judgment for money in a civil                            action.  Interest shall accrue on the amount ordered from the time of sentencing.                                 iv   The Department of Corrections shall make rules permitting the restitution payments                            to be credited to principal first and the remainder of payments credited to interest in accordance                            with Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.                                 e   If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount, or distribution of the restitution, the                            court shall at the time of sentencing allow the defendant a full hearing on the issue.                                     a   In addition to any other sentence the court may impose, the court shall order the                            defendant to pay restitution of governmental transportation expenses if the defendant was                                  i   transported pursuant to court order from one county to another within the state at                            governmental expense to resolve pending criminal charges                                  ii   charged with a felony or a class A, B, or C misdemeanor  and                                 iii   convicted of a crime.                                 b   The court may not order the defendant to pay restitution of governmental transportation                            expenses if any of the following apply                                  i   the defendant is charged with an infraction or on a subsequent failure to appear a                            warrant is issued for an infraction  or                                 ii   the defendant was not transported pursuant to a court order.                                 c   i   Restitution of governmental transportation expenses under Subsection     a  i  shall                            be calculated according to the following schedule                                  A       for up to     miles a defendant is transported                                  B        for     up to     miles a defendant is transported  and                                 C        for     miles or more a defendant is transported.                                 ii   The schedule of restitution under Subsection     c  i  applies to each defendant                            transported regardless of the number of defendants actually transported in a single trip.                                     a   If a statute under which the defendant was convicted mandates that one of three                            stated minimum terms shall be imposed, the court shall order imposition of the term of middle                            severity unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.                                 b   Prior to or at the time of sentencing, either party may submit a statement identifying                            circumstances in aggravation or mitigation or presenting additional facts.  If the statement is in                            writing, it shall be filed with the court and served on the opposing party at least four days prior to                               the time set for sentencing.                                 c   In determining whether there are circumstances that justify imposition of the highest                            or lowest term, the court may consider the record in the case, the probation officer s report, other                            reports, including reports received under Section                 , statements in aggravation or mitigation                            submitted by the prosecution or the defendant, and any further evidence introduced at the                            sentencing hearing.                                 d   The court shall set forth on the record the facts supporting and reasons for imposing                            the upper or lower term.                                 e    The court in  In determining a just sentence, the court shall consider sentencing                            guidelines regarding  aggravation and mitigation  aggravating and mitigating circumstances                            promulgated by the Sentencing Commission  on Criminal and Juvenile Justice .                                     If during the commission of a crime described as child kidnaping, rape of a child,                            object rape of a child, sodomy upon a child, or sexual abuse of a child, the defendant causes                            substantial bodily injury to the child, and if the charge is set forth in the information or indictment                            and admitted by the defendant, or found true by a judge or jury at trial, the defendant shall be                            sentenced to the highest minimum term in state prison.  This subsection takes precedence over any                            conflicting provision of law.                                     a   For the purpose of determining restitution for an offense, the offense shall include                            any criminal conduct admitted by the defendant to the sentencing court or to which the defendant                            agrees to pay restitution.  A victim of an offense, that involves as an element a scheme, a                            conspiracy, or a pattern of criminal activity, includes any person directly harmed by the defendant s                            criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.                                 b   In determining the monetary sum and other conditions for complete restitution, the                            court shall consider all relevant facts, including                                  i   the cost of the damage or loss if the offense resulted in damage to or loss or destruction                            of property of a victim of the offense                                  ii   the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to                            physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered                            in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment  the cost                            of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation  and the income lost by the                            victim as a result of the offense if the offense resulted in bodily injury to a victim  and                                    iii   the cost of necessary funeral and related services if the offense resulted in the death                            of a victim.                                 c   In determining the monetary sum and other conditions for court ordered restitution, the                            court shall consider the factors listed in Subsection     b  and                                  i   the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will                            impose, with regard to the other obligations of the defendant                                  ii   the ability of the defendant to pay restitution on an installment basis or on other                            conditions to be fixed by the court                                  iii   the rehabilitative effect on the defendant of the payment of restitution and the method                            of payment  and                                 iv   other circumstances which the court determines make restitution inappropriate.                                 d   The court may decline to make an order or may defer entering an order of restitution                            if the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process, as a result                            of considering an order of restitution under this subsection, substantially outweighs the need to                            provide restitution to the victim.
