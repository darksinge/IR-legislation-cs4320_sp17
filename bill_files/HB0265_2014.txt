198

    
without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian has the following powers and duties, except as
            
199

    (a)  To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of
            
201

    
competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, the guardian is entitled
            
202

reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects and
            
208

money and property for support, care, and education of the ward; but the guardian may not use
            
218

    
funds from the ward's estate for room and board which the guardian, the guardian's spouse,
            
219

    
parent, or child have furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order of
            
220

    
the court made upon notice to at least one adult relative in the nearest degree of kinship to the
            
221

    (e) (i)  A guardian is required to report the condition of the ward and of the estate which
            
224

    
has been subject to the guardian's possession or control, as required by the court or court rule.
            
225

    
    (ii)  A guardian is required to immediately notify all interested persons if the guardian
            
226

    
reasonably believes that the ward's death is likely to occur within the next 30 days, based on:
            
227

    
    (A)  the guardian's own observations; or
            
228

    
    (B)  information from the ward's physician or other medical care providers.
            
229

    
    (iii)  A guardian is required to immediately notify all interested persons of the ward's

notice of the guardian's intent to move the ward and to serve the notice on all interested persons
            
233

    
at least 10 days before the move.  The guardian shall take reasonable steps to notify all
            
234

    
interested persons and to file the notice with the court as soon as practicable following the

information.  The forms for both the informal report for estates under $50,000, excluding the
            
246

    
residence owned by the ward, and the full accounting report for larger estates shall be approved
            
247

    
by the Judicial Council.  This annual report shall be examined and approved by the court.  If
            
248

    
the ward's income is limited to a federal or state program requiring an annual accounting
            
249

    
report, a copy of that report may be submitted to the court in lieu of the required annual report.

internal report annually to the court.  The report shall be examined and approved by the court.
            
252

    
    (vii)  The guardian shall also render an annual accounting of the status of the person to
            
253

    
the court which shall be included in the petition or the informal annual report as required under
            
254

    
Subsection (2)(e).  If a fee is paid for an accounting of an estate, no fee shall be charged for an
            
255

    
accounting of the status of a person.
            
256

    
    (viii)  If a guardian:
            
257

    
    (A)  makes a substantial misstatement on filings of annual reports;
            
258

    
    (B)  is guilty of gross impropriety in handling the property of the ward; or
            
259

    
    (C)  willfully fails to file the report required by this subsection, after receiving written
            
260

    
notice from the court of the failure to file and after a grace period of two months has elapsed,
            
261

    
the court may impose a penalty in an amount not to exceed $5,000.  The court may also order
            
262

    
restitution of funds misappropriated from the estate of a ward.  The penalty shall be paid by the
            
263

    
guardian and may not be paid by the estate.
            
264

    
    (ix)  These provisions and penalties governing annual reports do not apply if the
            
265

    
guardian is the parent of the ward.
            
266

    
    (x)  For the purposes of Subsections (2)(e)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), "interested persons"

275

    
room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the

            
276


    
conservator, if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances.  The guardian

278

    
institutions for the ward's care and maintenance.

285

    
preserve and apply the property of the person to be protected as may be required for the
            
286

protective order exists with respect to a person for reasons other than minority, the court has,
            
293
