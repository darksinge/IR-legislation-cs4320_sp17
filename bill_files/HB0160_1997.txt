If a voter marks more names than there are persons to be elected to an office, or if for         any reason it is impossible to determine the choice of any voter for any office to be filled, the         counter may not count that voter s ballot for that office.                  The counter shall count a defective or incomplete mark on any paper ballot if               a   it is in the proper place  and              b   there is no other mark or cross on the paper ballot indicating the voter s intent to vote         other than as indicated by the defective mark.                   a   When the voter has marked the ballot so that it appears that the voter has voted          more than one straight ticket, the election judges may not count any votes for party candidates.               b   The election judges shall count the remainder of the ballot if it is voted correctly.                   A counter may not reject a ballot marked by the voter because of marks on the ballot          other than those marks allowed by this section unless the extraneous marks on a ballot or group          of ballots show an intent by a person or group to mark their ballots so that their ballots can be          identified.                   a   In counting the ballots, the counters shall give full consideration to the intent of the          voter.               b   The counters may not invalidate a ballot because of mechanical and technical defects          in voting or failure on the part of the voter to follow strictly the rules for balloting required by          Chapter  .

The counter may not count any paper ballot that does not have the official endorsement          by an election  judge  officer.                   If the counter discovers that the name of a candidate voted for is misspelled or that the          initial letters of a candidate s given name are transposed or omitted in part or altogether, the          counter shall count the voter s vote for that candidate if it is apparent that the voter intended to vote          for that candidate.                    The counter shall count a vote for the president and the vice president of any political                 party as a vote for the presidential electors selected by the political party.                   In counting the valid write in votes, if, by casting a valid write in vote, a voter has         cast more votes for an office than that voter is entitled to vote for that office, the judges shall count         the valid write in vote as being the obvious intent of the voter.             Section  .  Section    A       is amended to read                 A      .  Delivery of checked official register to county clerk after canvass.
