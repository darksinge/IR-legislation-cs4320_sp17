This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                           AMENDS                                       , as last amended by Chapter   , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .    Section                is amended to read                                        .  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody                           consideration.                                    If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is declared                           void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the minor                           children as it considers appropriate.  In determining custody, the court shall consider the best                           interests of the child and the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties.                            The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s desires regarding                            the  future custody or visitation schedules, but the expressed desires are not controlling and the                           court may determine the children s custody otherwise.  Interviews with the children may be                          conducted by the judge in camera with the consent of the parties.                                    In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds                           relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing the                           child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate.                                    If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has attempted                           to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into consideration in                              determining whether to award custody to the other parent.                                    a   A court may not discriminate against a parent due to a disability, as defined in                           Section                , in awarding custody or determining whether a substantial change has occurred                           for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.                                b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining                           whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody, the                           parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising therefrom by                           showing that                                 i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to provide                           for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or                                ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources available                           to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at                           issue.                                c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to                                 i   abuse, neglect, or dependency proceedings under Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and                           Family Services, or Title   , Chapter  a, Juvenile Courts  or                                ii   adoption proceedings under Title   , Chapter   , Adoption.
