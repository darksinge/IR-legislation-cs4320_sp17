29    supersede the provisions of this section.

30        (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (6)(a):

31        (i)  the convictions under Sections 76-5-404 and 76-5a-3 shall be governed by the

- 4 -


1    enhancement provisions of this section; and

2        (ii)  the "violent felony" offense defined in Subsection (1)(c) shall include any felony
