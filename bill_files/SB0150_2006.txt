28

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
29

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
76-3-402

 is amended to read:

            
30


    
     76-3-402.  Conviction of lower degree of offense.
            
31

    
    (1)  If the court, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense of which
            
32

    
the defendant was found guilty and to the history and character of the defendant, concludes it
            
33

    
would be unduly harsh to record the conviction as being for that degree of offense established
            
34

    
by statute and to sentence the defendant to an alternative normally applicable to that offense,
            
35

    
the court may unless otherwise specifically provided by law enter a judgment of conviction for
            
36

    
the next lower degree of offense and impose sentence accordingly.
            
37

    
    (2)  If a conviction is for a third degree felony the conviction is considered to be for a
            
38

    
class A misdemeanor if:
            
39

    
    (a)  the judge designates the sentence to be for a class A misdemeanor and the sentence
            
40

    
imposed is within the limits provided by law for a class A misdemeanor; or
            
41

    
    (b) (i)  the imposition of the sentence is stayed and the defendant is placed on probation,
            
42

    
whether committed to jail as a condition of probation or not;
            
43

    
    (ii)  the defendant is subsequently discharged without violating his probation; and
            
44

    
    (iii)  the judge upon motion and notice to the prosecuting attorney, and a hearing if
            
45

    
requested by either party or the court, finds it is in the interest of justice that the conviction be
            
46

    
considered to be for a class A misdemeanor.
            
47

    
    (3)  An offense may be reduced only one degree under this section unless the prosecutor
            
48

    
specifically agrees in writing or on the court record that the offense may be reduced two
            
49

    
degrees.  In no case may an offense be reduced under this section by more than two degrees.
            
50

    
    (4)  This section may not be construed to preclude any person from obtaining or being
            
51

    
granted an expungement of his record as provided by law.
            
52

    
    (5)  Judgment for a conviction for a lower degree of offense may not be entered if there
            
53

    
remains any unpaid balance on court ordered restitution for the offense for which the reduction
            
54

    
is sought.
            
55

58


    
    (1)  The division shall issue a certificate of eligibility to a petitioner seeking to obtain
            
59

60

    
finds, through records of a governmental agency, including national criminal data bases that:
            
61

    
    (a)  the conviction for which expungement is sought is:
