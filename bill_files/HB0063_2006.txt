27

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

            
28


    
    Section 1.  
Section  
75-2-803

 is amended to read:
            
29

    
     75-2-803.  Definitions -- Effect of homicide on intestate succession, wills, trusts,
            
30

    
 joint assets, life insurance, and beneficiary designations -- Forfeiture -- Revocation.
            
31

    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
32

    
    (a)  "Disposition or appointment of property" includes a transfer of an item of property
            
33

    
or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument.
            
34

    
    (b)  "Disqualifying homicide" means a homicide established by a preponderance of the
            
35

    
evidence that meets the elements of any felony homicide offense in Title 76, Chapter 5,
            
36

    
Offenses Against the Person, except automobile homicide, applying the same principles of
            
37

    
culpability and defenses as in Title 76, including but not limited to Chapter 2, Principles of
            
38

    
Criminal Responsibility.
            
39

    
    [(b)] (c)  "Governing instrument" means a governing instrument executed by the
            
40

    
decedent.
            
41

    
    (d)  "Killer" means a person who commits a disqualifying homicide.
            
42

    
    [(c)] (e)  "Revocable," with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision, or
            
43

    
nomination, means one under which the decedent, at the time of or immediately before death,
            
44

    
was alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the designation, in
            
45

    
favor of the killer, whether or not the decedent was then empowered to designate himself in
            
46

    
place of his killer and whether or not the decedent then had capacity to exercise the power.
            
47

    
    (2)  An individual who [feloniously and intentionally kills] commits a disqualifying
            
48

    
homicide of the decedent forfeits all benefits under this chapter with respect to the decedent's
            
49

    
estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or child's share, a
            
50

    
homestead allowance, exempt property, and a family allowance.  If the decedent died intestate,
            
51

    
the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed his intestate share.
            
52

    
    (3)  The [felonious and intentional] killing of the decedent by means of a disqualifying
            
53

56

    
governing instrument;
            
57

    
    (ii)  provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of
            
58

    
appointment on the killer; and

            
59


    
    (iii)  nomination of the killer in a governing instrument, nominating or appointing the
            
60

    
killer to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative,
            
61

    
executor, trustee, or agent;  and
            
62

    
    (b)  severs the interests of the decedent and killer in property held by them at the time of
            
63

    
the killing as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests of the
            
64

    
decedent and killer into tenancies in common.
            
65

    
    (4)  A severance under Subsection (3)(b) does not affect any third-party interest in
            
66

    
property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the
            
67

    
killer unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded in
            
68

    
records appropriate to the kind and location of the property which are relied upon, in the
            
69

    
ordinary course of transactions involving such property, as evidence of ownership.
            
70

    
    (5)  Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the killer disclaimed all
            
71

    
provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or
            
72

    
representative capacity, as if the killer predeceased the decedent.
            
73

    
    (6)  A wrongful acquisition of property or interest by [a killer] one who kills another
            
74

    
under circumstances not covered by this section shall be treated in accordance with the
            
75

    
principle that [a killer] one who kills cannot profit from his wrong.
            
76

    
    (7)  [After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing
            
77

    
criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively
            
78

    
establishes the convicted individual as the decedent's killer for purposes of this section.  In the
            
79

    
absence of a conviction, the] The court, upon the petition of an interested person, shall
            
80

    
determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual [would be
            
81

    
found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing] has committed a
            
82

    
disqualifying homicide of the decedent.  If the court determines that, under that standard, the
            
83

    
individual [would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing] has
            
84

    
committed a disqualifying homicide of the decedent, the determination conclusively establishes
            
85

    
that individual as [the decedent's killer] having committed a disqualifying homicide for
            
86

    
purposes of this section.  A judgment of criminal conviction for a disqualifying homicide of the
            
87

    
decedent, after all direct appeals have been exhausted, conclusively establishes that the
            
88

    
convicted individual has committed the disqualifying homicide for purposes of this section.
            
89

    
    (8) (a)  A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or

            
90


    
transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing
            
91

    
instrument affected by [an intentional and felonious killing] a disqualifying homicide, or for
            
92

    
having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument,
            
93

    
upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent's death, before the payor or other third party
            
94

    
received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.  A payor or
            
95

    
other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third
            
96

    
party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.
            
97

    
    (b)  Written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under Subsection (8)(a) shall be
            
98

    
mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by registered or certified mail,
            
99

    
return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a
            
100

    
summons in a civil action.  Upon receipt of written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation
            
101

    
under this section, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit
            
102

    
any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate
            
103

    
proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if no proceedings have been commenced, to or
            
104

    
with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estates
            
105

    
located in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall hold the funds or item of
            
106

    
property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance
            
107

    
with the determination.  Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge
            
108

    
the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of
            
109

    
property transferred to or deposited with the court.
            
110

    
    (9) (a)  A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives
            
111

    
a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable
            
112

    
obligation, is neither obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property, or
            
113

    
benefit nor is liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of
            
114

    
property or benefit.  But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of property, or
            
115

    
any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the
            
116

    
payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or
            
117

    
the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.
            
118

    
    (b)  If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to
            
119

    
a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered by this section, a person who, not
            
120

    
for value, receives the payment, item of property, or any other benefit to which the person is
