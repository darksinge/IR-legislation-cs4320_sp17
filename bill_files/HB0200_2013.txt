2415


    
methamphetamine base "crack" cocaine and methamphetamine "ice" respectively, has
            
2416

    
increased dramatically throughout the western states and Utah.  These highly technical illegal
            
2417

    
operations create substantial dangers to the general public and environment from fire,
            
2418

    
explosions, and the release of toxic chemicals.  By their very nature these activities often
            
2419

    
involve a number of persons in a conspiratorial enterprise to bring together all necessary
            
2420

    
components for clandestine production, to thwart regulation and detection, and to distribute the
            
2421

    
final product.  Therefore, the Legislature enacts the following Utah Clandestine Laboratory Act
            
2422

    
for prosecution of specific illegal laboratory operations.  With regard to the controlled
            
2423

Section  
76-1-403

 is amended to read:
            
2759

    
     76-1-403.  Former prosecution barring subsequent prosecution for offense out of
            
2760

    
 same episode.
            
2761

    
    (1) If a defendant has been prosecuted for one or more offenses arising out of a single
            
2762

    
criminal episode, a subsequent prosecution for the same or a different offense arising out of the
            
2763

    
same criminal episode is barred if:
            
2764

    
    (a)  the subsequent prosecution is for an offense that was or should have been tried
            
2765

    
under Subsection 

76-1-402

(2) in the former prosecution; and
            
2766

    
    (b)  the former prosecution:
            
2767

    
    (i)  resulted in acquittal; [or]
            
2768

    
    (ii)  resulted in conviction; [or]
            
2769

    
    (iii)  was improperly terminated; or
            
2770

    
    (iv)  was terminated by a final order or judgment for the defendant that has not been
            
2771

    
reversed, set aside, or vacated and that necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a
            
2772

    
fact that must be established to secure conviction in the subsequent prosecution.
            
2773

    
    (2)  There is an acquittal if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not guilty by the trier
            
2774

    
of facts or in a determination that there was insufficient evidence to warrant conviction.  A
            
2775

    
finding of guilty of a lesser included offense is an acquittal of the greater offense even though
            
2776

    
the conviction for the lesser included offense is subsequently reversed, set aside, or vacated.
            
2777

    
    (3)  There is a conviction if the prosecution resulted in a judgment of guilt that has not
            
2778

    
been reversed, set aside, or vacated; a verdict of guilty that has not been reversed, set aside, or
            
2779

    
vacated and that is capable of supporting a judgment; or a plea of guilty accepted by the court.
            
2780

    
    (4)  There is an improper termination of prosecution if the termination takes place
            
2781

    
before the verdict, is for reasons not amounting to an acquittal, and takes place after a jury has
            
2782

    
been impaneled and sworn to try the defendant, or, if the jury trial is waived, after the first
            
2783

    
witness is sworn.  However, termination of prosecution is not improper if:
            
2784

    
    (a)  the defendant consents to the termination; [or]
            
2785

    
    (b)  the defendant waives his right to object to the termination; or
            
2786

    
    (c)  the court finds and states for the record that the termination is necessary because:

            
2787


    
    (i)  it is physically impossible to proceed with the trial in conformity with the law; [or]
            
2788

    
    (ii)  there is a legal defect in the proceeding not attributable to the state that would make
            
2789

    
any judgment entered upon a verdict reversible as a matter of law; [or]
            
2790

    
    (iii)  prejudicial conduct in or out of the courtroom not attributable to the state makes it
            
2791

    
impossible to proceed with the trial without injustice to the defendant or the state; [or]
            
2792

    
    (iv)  the jury is unable to agree upon a verdict; or
            
2793

    
    (v)  false statements of a juror on voir dire prevent a fair trial.
            
2794

    
    Section 53.  
Section  
76-1-501

 is amended to read:
            
2795

    
     76-1-501.  Presumption of innocence -- "Element of the offense" defined.
            
2796

    
    (1) A defendant in a criminal proceeding is presumed to be innocent until each element
            
2797

    
of the offense charged against him is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  In the absence of
            
2798

    
[such] this proof, the defendant shall be acquitted.
            
2799

    
    (2)  As used in this part the words "element of the offense" mean:

2801

    
or forbidden in the definition of the offense;
            
2802

    
    (b)  The culpable mental state required.
            
2803

established by a preponderance of the evidence.

date of conviction or commitment of any case relied upon by the prosecution.

    (b) (i)  The defendant shall serve notice in writing upon the prosecutor if the defendant

    (A)  the defendant is the person who was convicted or committed;
            
2963

    
    (B)  the defendant was represented by counsel or had waived counsel; or

    (4) (a)  If the defendant enters a denial under Subsection (3)(b) and if the case is tried to
            
2968

    
a jury, the jury may not be told, until after it returns its verdict on the underlying felony charge,
            
2969

    
of the:
            
2970

    
    (i)  defendant's previous convictions for violent felonies, except as otherwise provided
            
2971

    
in the Utah Rules of Evidence; or

    (ii)  allegation against the defendant of being a habitual violent offender.

            
2973


    
    (b)  If the jury's verdict is guilty, the defendant shall be tried regarding the allegation of
            
2974

    
being an habitual violent offender by the same jury, if practicable, unless the defendant waives
            
2975

2980

    
evidence.
            
2981

    
    (iii) Before sentencing under this section, the trier of fact shall determine whether this
            
2982

    
section is applicable beyond a reasonable doubt.
            
2983

    
    (d)  If any previous conviction and commitment is based upon a plea of guilty or no
            
2984

    
contest, there is a rebuttable presumption that the conviction and commitment were regular and
            
2985

    
lawful in all respects if the conviction and commitment occurred after January 1, 1970.  If the
            
2986

    
conviction and commitment occurred prior to January 1, 1970, the burden is on the prosecution
            
2987

    
to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was then represented by
            
2988

    
counsel or had lawfully waived the right to have counsel present, and that the defendant's plea
            
2989

    
was understandingly and voluntarily entered.
            
2990

    
    (e)  If the trier of fact finds this section applicable, the court shall enter that specific
            
2991

    
finding on the record and shall indicate in the order of judgment and commitment that the
            
2992

    
defendant has been found by the trier of fact to be a habitual violent offender and is sentenced
            
2993

    
under this section.
            
2994

    
    (5) (a)  The sentencing enhancement provisions of Section 

76-3-407

 supersede the
            
2995

    
provisions of this section.
            
2996

    
    (b)  Notwithstanding Subsection (5)(a), the "violent felony" offense defined in

Subsection (1)(c) shall include any felony sexual offense violation of Title 76, Chapter 5, Part
            
2998

    
4, Sexual Offenses, to determine if the convicted person is a habitual violent offender.

76-5-404

; and
            
3005

    
    (b)  applying the sentencing enhancement provided for in this section would result in a
            
3006

    
lower maximum penalty than the penalty provided for under the section that describes the
            
3007

    
offense for which the person is being sentenced.
            
3008

    
    Section 56.

     76-4-203.  Criminal solicitation -- Elements.
            
3010

    
    (1)  An actor commits criminal solicitation if, with intent that a felony be committed, he
            
3011

    
solicits, requests, commands, offers to hire, or importunes another person to engage in specific
            
3012

    
conduct that under the circumstances as the actor believes them to be would be a felony or
            
3013

    
would cause the other person to be a party to the commission of a felony.
            
3014

    
    (2)  An actor may be convicted under this section only if the solicitation is made under
            
3015

    
circumstances strongly corroborative of the actor's intent that the offense be committed.
            
3016

    
    (3)  It is not a defense under this section that the person solicited by the actor:

3018

3020

    
any offense;

    (d)  is not criminally responsible for the felony solicited;

    (e)  was acquitted, was not prosecuted or convicted, or was convicted of a different
            
3023

    
offense or of a different type or degree of offense; or
            
3024

    
    (f)  is immune from prosecution.
            
3025

    
    (4)  It is not a defense under this section that the actor:
            
3026

    
    (a)  belongs to a class of persons that by definition is legally incapable of committing
            
3027

    
the offense in an individual capacity; or
            
3028

    
    (b)  fails to communicate with the person he solicits to commit an offense, if the intent
            
3029

    
of the actor's conduct was to effect the communication.
            
3030

    
    (5)  Nothing in this section prevents an actor who otherwise solicits, requests,
            
3031

    
commands, encourages, or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which
            
3032

    
constitutes an offense from being prosecuted and convicted as a party to the offense under
            
3033

    
Section 

76-2-202

 if the person solicited actually commits the offense.
            
3034

    
    Section 57.  
Section  
76-4-401

 is amended to read:

plaintiffs have been passed on to others who are entitled to recover so as to avoid duplication
            
3801

    
of recovery of damages.  In an action by indirect purchasers, any damages or settlement

absence of proof to the contrary, that the injured persons who dealt indirectly with the
            
3809

    
defendant incurred at least 1/3 of the damages, and shall, therefore, recover at least 1/3 of the

            
3810


    
awarded damages.  The final 1/3 of the damages shall be awarded by the court to those injured
            
3811

    
persons determined by the court as most likely to have absorbed the damages.

all increments in its cost due to an increase in the cost of an ingredient or a component product
            
3815

    
or service that was caused by a violation of this chapter.  This amount will be presumed, in the

absence of evidence to the contrary, to be equal to the change in the cost, in dollars and cents,
            
3817

    
of the ingredient, component product, or service to its first purchaser.
            
3818

3820

    
general shall receive a copy of each filing from each plaintiff.  The attorney general may, in his
            
3821

    
or her discretion, intervene or file amicus briefs in the case, and may be heard on the question
            
3822

    
of the fairness or appropriateness of any proposed settlement agreement.
            
3823

    
    (10)  If, in a class action or parens patriae action filed under this chapter, including the
            
3824

    
settlement of any action, it is not feasible to return any part of the recovery to the injured
            
3825

    
plaintiffs, the court shall order the residual funds be applied to benefit the specific class of
            
3826

    
injured plaintiffs, to improve antitrust enforcement generally by depositing the residual funds
            
3827

    
into the Attorney General Litigation Fund created by Section 

76-10-922

, or both.
            
3828

    
    (11)  In any action brought under this chapter, the court shall approve all attorney fees

4064

    
    (14) (a)  Following the hearing, the court shall determine by a preponderance of
            
4065

    (i)  competent to proceed;
            
4067

    
    (ii)  not competent to proceed with a substantial probability that the minor may attain
            
4068

    
competency in the foreseeable future; or
            
4069

    
    (iii)  not competent to proceed without a substantial probability that the minor may
            
4070

    
attain competency in the foreseeable future.

terminate the competency proceeding, dismiss the delinquency charges without prejudice, and
            
4077

    
release the minor from any custody order related to the pending delinquency proceeding, unless
            
4078

    
the prosecutor informs the court that commitment proceedings pursuant to Title 62A, Chapter
            
4079

    
5, Services for People with Disabilities, or Title 62A, Chapter 15, Substance Abuse and Mental
            
4080

    
Health Act, will be initiated.  These commitment proceedings shall be initiated within seven
            
4081

    
days after the court's order, unless the court enlarges the time for good cause shown.  The
            
4082

    
minor may be ordered to remain in custody until the commitment proceedings have been
            
4083

    
concluded.
