11

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
12

    
    This bill:
            
13

14

    
notice of intent to seek the death penalty within 60 days after the arraignment;
            
15

    
    .    provides that the court may not receive a plea to a noncapital first degree aggravated
            
16

    
homicide offense during the filing period unless agreed to by the prosecution;
            
17

    
    .    provides that if the prosecutor does not file notice of intent to seek the death
            
18

    
penalty, the offense is noncapital first degree felony aggravated homicide;
            
19

    
    .    provides that a person who has been convicted of or has pled to a noncapital

44

    
     76-3-207.  Capital felony -- Sentencing proceeding.
            
45

    
    (1) (a)  When a defendant has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a capital felony,
            
46

    
there shall be further proceedings before the court or jury on the issue of sentence.
            
47

    
    (b)  In the case of a plea of guilty to a capital felony, the sentencing proceedings shall
            
48

    
be conducted before a jury or, upon request of the defendant and with the approval of the court
            
49

    
and the consent of the prosecution, by the court which accepted the plea.
            
50

    
    (c) (i)  When a defendant has been found guilty of a capital felony, the proceedings
            
51

    
shall be conducted before the court or jury which found the defendant guilty, provided the
            
52

    
defendant may waive hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of
            
53

    
the prosecution, in which event the hearing shall be before the court.
            
54

    
    (ii)  If circumstances make it impossible or impractical to reconvene the same jury for
            
55

    
the sentencing proceedings, the court may dismiss that jury and convene a new jury for the
            
56

    
proceedings.
            
57

    
    (d)  If a retrial of the sentencing proceedings is necessary as a consequence of a remand

            
58


    
from an appellate court, the sentencing authority shall be determined as provided in Subsection
            
59

    
(6).
            
60

    
    (2) (a)  In capital sentencing proceedings, evidence may be presented on:
            
61

    
    (i)  the nature and circumstances of the crime;
            
62

    
    (ii)  the defendant's character, background, history, and mental and physical condition;
            
63

    
    (iii)  the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim's family and community
            
64

    
without comparison to other persons or victims; and
            
65

    
    (iv)  any other facts in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty that the court considers
            
66

    
relevant to the sentence.
            
67

    
    (b)  Any evidence the court considers to have probative force may be received
            
68

    
regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.  The state's attorney and
            
69

    
the defendant shall be permitted to present argument for or against the sentence of death.
            
70

    
    (3)  Aggravating circumstances include those outlined in Section 

76-5-202

.
            
71

    
    (4)  Mitigating circumstances include:
            
72

    
    (a)  the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;
            
73

    
    (b)  the homicide was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental
            
74

    
or emotional disturbance;
            
75

    
    (c)  the defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person;
            
76

    
    (d)  at the time of the homicide, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the
            
77

    
wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of law was impaired
            
78

    
as a result of a mental condition, intoxication, or influence of drugs, except that "mental
            
79

    
condition" under this Subsection (4)(d) does not mean an abnormality manifested primarily by
            
80

    
repeated criminal conduct;
            
81

    
    (e)  the youth of the defendant at the time of the crime;
            
82

    
    (f)  the defendant was an accomplice in the homicide committed by another person and
            
83

    
the defendant's participation was relatively minor; and
            
84

    
    (g)  any other fact in mitigation of the penalty.
            
85

    
    (5) (a)  The court or jury, as the case may be, shall retire to consider the penalty.  Except

            
86


    
as provided in Subsection 

76-3-207.5

(2), in all proceedings before a jury, under this section, it
            
87

    
shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon a unanimous decision for death
            
88

    
and that the penalty of either an indeterminate prison term of not less than 20 years and which
            
89

    
may be for life or life in prison without parole, shall be imposed if a unanimous decision for
            
90

    
death is not found.
            
91

    
    (b)  The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the
            
92

    
aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that
            
93

    
total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable
            
94

    
doubt, that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances. 
            
95

    
If the jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall
            
96

    
discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of death.
            
97

    
    (c)  If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision imposing the sentence of death
            
98

    
[or the state is not seeking the death penalty], the jury shall then determine whether the penalty
            
99

    
of life in prison without parole shall be imposed, except as provided in Subsection
            
100

    

76-3-207.5

(2).  The penalty of life in prison without parole shall only be imposed if the jury
            
101

    
determines that the sentence of life in prison without parole is appropriate.  If the jury reports
            
102

    
agreement by ten jurors or more to impose the sentence of life in prison without parole, the
            
103

    
court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of life in prison without parole.  If
            
104

    
ten jurors or more do not agree upon a sentence of life in prison without parole, the court shall
            
105

    
discharge the jury and impose an indeterminate prison term of not less than 20 years and which
            
106

    
may be for life.
            
107

    
    (d)  If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, with the approval
            
108

    
of the court and the consent of the prosecution, the court shall determine the appropriate
            
109

    
penalty according to the standards of Subsections (5)(b) and (c).
            
110

    
    (e)  If the defendant is sentenced to more than one term of life in prison with or without
            
111

    
the possibility of parole, or in addition to a sentence of life in prison with or without the
            
112

    
possibility of parole the defendant is sentenced for other offenses which result in terms of
            
113

    
imprisonment, the judge shall determine whether the terms of imprisonment shall be imposed

            
114


    
as concurrent or consecutive sentences in accordance with Section 

76-3-401

.
            
115

    
    (6)  Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate
            
116

    
court, if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence
            
117

    
of death and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent
            
118

    
necessary to correct the error or errors.  An error in the sentencing proceedings may not result
            
119

    
in the reversal of the conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing
            
120

    
proceedings, all exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted
            
121

    
in the prior trial and sentencing proceedings are admissible in the new sentencing proceedings,
            
122

    
and if the sentencing proceeding was before a:
            
123

    
    (a)  jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding unless the
            
124

    
defendant waives the hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of
            
125

    
the prosecution, in which case the proceeding shall be held according to Subsection (6)(b) or
            
126

    
(c), as applicable;
            
127

    
    (b)  judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding; or
            
128

    
    (c)  judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new
            
129

    
sentencing proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing
            
130

    
proceeding, and the new proceeding will be before a jury unless the defendant waives the
            
131

    
hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecution.
            
132

    
    (7)  [In the event the death] If the penalty of death is held to be unconstitutional by the
            
133

    
Utah Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a
            
134

    
person previously sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the person to be brought
            
135

    
before the court, and the court shall sentence the person to[:] life in prison without parole.
            
136

    
    [(a)  an indeterminate prison term of not less than 20 years and which may be for life, if
            
137

    
the death penalty is held unconstitutional prior to April 27, 1992; or]
            
138

    
    [(b)  life in prison without parole if the death penalty is held unconstitutional on or after
            
139

    
April 27, 1992, and any person who is thereafter  convicted of a capital felony shall be
            
140

    
sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of not less than 20 years and which may be for life or
            
141

    
life in prison without parole.]

            
142


    
    (8) (a)  If the appellate court's final decision regarding any appeal of a sentence of death
            
143

    
precludes the imposition of the death penalty due to mental retardation or subaverage general
            
144

    
intellectual functioning under Section 

77-15a-101

, the court having jurisdiction over a
            
145

    
defendant previously sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the defendant to be
            
146

    
brought before the sentencing court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to life in prison
            
147

    
without parole.
            
148

    
    (b)  If the appellate court precludes the imposition of the death penalty under
            
149

    
Subsection (8)(a), but the appellate court finds that sentencing the defendant to life in prison
            
150

    
without parole is likely to result in a manifest injustice, it may remand the case to the
            
151

    
sentencing court for further sentencing proceedings to determine if the defendant should serve
            
152

    
a sentence of life in prison without parole or an indeterminate prison term of not less than 20
            
153

    
years and which may be for life.
            
154
