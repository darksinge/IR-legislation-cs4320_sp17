40

    
    [(ii)] (b)  ensure that districts are not building secondary schools in close proximity to

63

    
    [(4)] (7) (a)  To avoid penalizing a district financially for consolidating its small
            
64

    
schools, additional weighted pupil units may be allowed a district each year, not to exceed two
            
65

    
years.
            
66

    
    (b)  The additional weighted pupil units may not exceed the difference between what
            
67

    
the district receives for a consolidated school and what it would have received for the small
            
68

    
schools had they not been consolidated.
            
69

    
    (8)  An amount not to exceed five percent of the total necessarily existent small schools
