sustained-yield principles in public land use planning and management; and

            
865


    
    (ii)  multiple-use and sustained-yield management means that federal agencies should
            
866

    
develop and implement management plans and make other resource-use decisions that:
            
867

    
    (A)  achieve and maintain in perpetuity a high-level annual or regular periodic output of

897

    
state water appropriation system;
            
898

supply of resources for the people of the state and the people of the local communities who
            
910

    
depend on these resources for a sustainable economy;
            
911

    
    (k)  forests, rangelands, timber, and other vegetative resources:
            
912

    
    (i)  provide forage for livestock;

919

    
industries by utilizing proven techniques and tools are vital to the state's economy and the
            
920

    
quality of life in Utah; and
            
921

    
    (m) (i)  land management plans, programs, and initiatives should provide that the
            
922

    
amount of domestic livestock forage, expressed in animal unit months, for permitted, active
            
923

    
use as well as the wildlife forage included in that amount, be no less than the maximum
            
924

    
number of animal unit months sustainable by range conditions in grazing allotments and
            
925

    
districts, based on an on-the-ground and scientific analysis;
            
926

cattlemen's, sportsmen's, and wildlife management groups such as chaining, logging, seeding,
            
930

    
burning, and other direct soil and vegetation prescriptions that are demonstrated to restore
            
931

    
forest and rangeland health,  increase forage, and improve watersheds in grazing districts and
            
932

    
allotments for the mutual benefit of domestic livestock and wildlife;
            
933

    
    (B)  when practices described in Subsection (6)(m)(iii)(A) increase a grazing
            
934

    
allotment's forage beyond the total permitted forage use that was allocated to that allotment in
            
935

    
the last federal land use plan or allotment management plan still in existence as of January 1,
            
936

    
2005, a reasonable and fair portion of the increase in forage beyond the previously allocated
            
937

    
total permitted use should be allocated to wildlife as recommended by a joint, evenly balanced
            
938

    
committee of livestock and wildlife representatives that is appointed and constituted by the
            
939

    
governor for that purpose;
            
940

    
    (C)  the state favors quickly and effectively adjusting wildlife population goals and
            
941

    
population census numbers in response to variations in the amount of available forage caused
            
942

    
by drought or other climatic adjustments, and state agencies responsible for managing wildlife
            
943

    
population goals and population census numbers will give due regard to both the needs of the
            
944

    
livestock industry and the need to prevent the decline of species to a point where listing under
            
945

    
the terms of the Endangered Species Act when making such adjustments;
            
946

    
    (iv)  the state opposes the transfer of grazing animal unit months to wildlife for
            
947

    
supposed reasons of rangeland health;
            
948

    
    (v)  reductions in domestic livestock animal unit months must be temporary and
            
949

    
scientifically based upon rangeland conditions;
            
950

    
    (vi)  policies, plans, programs, initiatives, resource management plans, and forest plans
            
951

    
may not allow the placement of grazing animal unit months in a suspended use category unless
            
952

    
there is a rational and scientific determination that the condition of the rangeland allotment or
            
953

    
district in question will not sustain the animal unit months sought to be placed in suspended
            
954

    
use;
            
955

    
    (vii)  any grazing animal unit months that are placed in a suspended use category should
            
956

    
be returned to active use when range conditions improve;
            
957

    
    (viii)  policies, plans, programs, and initiatives related to vegetation management

            
958


    
should recognize and uphold the preference for domestic grazing over alternate forage uses in
            
959

    
established grazing districts while upholding management practices that optimize and expand
            
960

    
forage for grazing and wildlife in conjunction with state wildlife management plans and
            
961

    
programs in order to provide maximum available forage for all uses; and
            
962

    
    (ix)  in established grazing districts, animal unit months that have been reduced due to
            
963

    
rangeland health concerns should be restored to livestock when rangeland conditions improve,
            
964

    
and should not be converted to wildlife use.
            
965

    
    (7)  The state planning coordinator shall recognize and promote the following findings
            
966

federal lands and natural resources on federal lands under this section:
            
968

    
    (a)  as a coholder of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way with the counties, the state supports its
            
969

970

    
the federal government to fully recognize the rights-of-way and their use by the public as
            
971

    
expeditiously as possible;
            
972

    
    (b)  it is the policy of the state to use reasonable administrative and legal measures to
            
973

    
protect and preserve valid existing rights-of-way granted by Congress under R.S. 2477, and to
            
974

    
support and work in conjunction with counties to redress cases where R.S. 2477 rights-of-way
            
975

    
are not recognized or are impaired; and
            
976

    
    (c)  transportation and access routes to and across federal lands, including all
            
977

    
rights-of-way vested under R.S. 2477, are vital to the state's economy and to the quality of life
            
978

    
in the state, and must provide, at a minimum, a network of roads throughout the resource
            
979

    
planning area that provides for:

994

    
in the preparation of any plans, policies, programs, processes, or desired outcomes relating to
            
995

    
federal lands and natural resources on federal lands pursuant to this section:

physiographic provinces in the state, and that the rationale and justification for the conclusions
            
1002

    
are disclosed;
            
1003

    
    (iii)  it is clearly demonstrated that the inclusion of each river segment is consistent

potential additions have been applied in a consistent manner by all federal agencies;
            
1013

    
    (vi)  the rationale and justification for the proposed addition, including a comparison
            
1014

    
with protections offered by other management tools, is clearly analyzed within the multiple-use
            
1015

    
mandate, and the results disclosed;
            
1016

    
    (vii)  it is clearly demonstrated that the federal agency with management authority over
            
1017

    
the river segment, and which is proposing the segment for inclusion in the National Wild and
            
1018

    
Scenic River System will not use the actual or proposed designation as a basis to impose
            
1019

    
management standards outside of the federal land management plan;

            
1020


    
    (viii)  it is clearly demonstrated that the terms and conditions of the federal land and
            
1021

    
resource management plan containing a recommendation for inclusion in the National Wild
            
1022

Scenic River System at the eligibility phase;
            
1027

    
    (C)  fully disclaims any interest in water rights for the recommended segment as a result
            
1028

    
of the adoption of the plan; and
            
1029

    
    (D)  fully disclaims the use of the recommendation for inclusion in the National Wild
            
1030

    
and Scenic River System as a reason or rationale for an evaluation of impacts by proposals for
            
1031

    
projects upstream, downstream, or within the recommended segment;
            
1032

    
    (ix)  it is clearly demonstrated that the agency with management authority over the river

(ACEC), as defined in 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1702, within federal land management plans will be
            
1050

    
withheld until:

            
1051


    
    (i)  it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area satisfies all the definitional
            
1052

    
requirements of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. Sec.
            
1053

    
1702(a);
            
1054

    
    (ii)  it is clearly demonstrated that the area proposed for designation as an ACEC is
            
1055

    
limited in geographic size and that the proposed management prescriptions are limited in scope
            
1056

    
to the minimum necessary to specifically protect and prevent irreparable damage to the relevant
            
1057

    
and important values identified, or limited in geographic size and management prescriptions to
            
1058

    
the minimum required to specifically protect human life or safety from natural hazards;
            
1059

    
    (iii)  it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area is limited only to areas that are
            
1060

    
already developed or used or to areas where no development is required;

unique or substantially significant on a regional basis, or contain natural hazards which
            
1064

    
significantly threaten human life or safety;

    (v)  the federal agency has analyzed regional values, resources, processes, or hazards for
            
1066

    
irreparable damage and its potential causes resulting from potential actions which are
            
1067

    
consistent with the multiple-use, sustained-yield principles, and the analysis describes the
            
1068

    
rationale for any special management attention required to protect, or prevent irreparable
            
1069

    
damage to the values, resources, processes, or hazards;
            
1070

    
    (vi)  it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed designation is consistent with the plans

1074

    
redundantly over existing protections provided by other state and federal laws for federal lands
            
1075

    
or resources on federal lands, and that the federal statutory requirement for special management
            
1076

    
attention for a proposed ACEC will discuss and justify any management requirements needed
            
1077

    
in addition to those specified by the other state and federal laws;
            
1078

    
    (viii)  the difference between special management attention required for an ACEC and
            
1079

    
normal multiple-use management has been identified and justified, and that any determination

of irreparable damage has been analyzed and justified for short and long-term horizons;
            
1081

    
    (ix)  it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed designation:

            
1082


    
    (A)  is not a substitute for a wilderness suitability recommendation;

    (B)  is not a substitute for managing areas inventoried for wilderness characteristics
            
1084

    
after 1993 under the BLM interim management plan for valid wilderness study areas; and
            
1085

    
    (C)  it is not an excuse or justification to apply de facto wilderness management

exchanges of school and institutional trust lands and federal lands without regard for a
            
1092

    
resource-to-resource correspondence between the surface or mineral characteristics of the
            
1093

    
offered trust lands and the offered federal lands;
            
1094

    
    (e)  federal agencies should support government-to-government exchanges of land with
            
1095

    
the state based on a fair process of valuation which meets the fiduciary obligations of both the
            
1096

    
state and federal governments toward trust lands management, and which assures that revenue
            
1097

    
authorized by federal statute to the state from mineral or timber production, present or future, is
            
1098

    
not diminished in any manner during valuation, negotiation, or implementation processes;

    (f)  agricultural and grazing lands should continue to produce the food and fiber needed
            
1100

    
by the citizens of the state and the nation, and the rural character and open landscape of rural
            
1101

    
Utah should be preserved through a healthy and active agricultural and grazing industry,

consistent with private property rights and state fiduciary duties;
            
1103

    
    (g)  the resources of the forests and rangelands of the state should be integrated as part
            
1104

    
of viable, robust, and sustainable state and local economies, and available forage should be
            
1105

    
evaluated for the full complement of herbivores the rangelands can support in a sustainable
            
1106

    
manner, and forests should contain a diversity of timber species, and disease or insect
            
1107

    
infestations in forests should be controlled using logging or other best management practices;

    (h)  the state opposes any additional evaluation of national forest service lands as
            
1109

    
"roadless" or "unroaded" beyond the forest service's second roadless area review evaluation and
            
1110

    
opposes efforts by agencies to specially manage those areas in a way that:
