AMENDS:
            

    
     31A-22-303, as last amended by Chapters 181 and 325, Laws of Utah 1998
            

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
31A-22-303

 is amended to read:
            

    
     31A-22-303.  Motor vehicle liability coverage.
            

    
    (1) (a)  In addition to complying with the requirements of Chapter 21 and Part II of Chapter
            

    
22, a policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection 

31A-22-302

(1)(a) shall:
            

    
    (i)  name the motor vehicle owner or operator in whose name the policy was purchased,
            

    
state that named insured's address, the coverage afforded, the premium charged, the policy period,
            

    
and the limits of liability;
            

    
    (ii) (A)  if it is an owner's policy, designate by appropriate reference all the motor vehicles
            

    
on which coverage is granted, insure the person named in the policy, insure any other person using
            

    
any named motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured, and, except
            

    
as provided in Subsection (7), insure any person included in Subsection (1)(a)(iii) against loss from
            

    
the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of these
            

    
motor vehicles within the United States and Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and
            

    
costs, for each motor vehicle, in amounts not less than the minimum limits specified under Section
            

    

31A-22-304

; or
            

    
    (B)  if it is an operator's policy, insure the person named as insured against loss from the
            

    
liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the insured's use of any motor
            

    
vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and with the same limits of liability
            

    
as in an owner's policy under Subsection (1)(ii)(A);

            

    
    (iii)  except as provided in Subsection (7), insure persons related to the named insured by
            

    
blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship who are residents of the named insured's household,
            

    
including those who usually make their home in the same household but temporarily live elsewhere,
            

    
to the same extent as the named insured and the available coverage of the policy may not be reduced
            

    
to the persons described in this Subsection (1)(a)(iii) because:
            

    
    (A)  a permissive user driving a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident; or
            

    
    (B)  the named insured or any of the persons described in this Subsection (1)(a)(iii) driving
            

    
a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident; and
            

    
    (iv)  cover damages or injury resulting from a covered driver of a motor vehicle who is
            

    
stricken by an unforeseeable paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition and who is not
            

    
reasonably aware that paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition is about to occur to the
            

    
extent that a person of ordinary prudence would not attempt to continue driving.
            

    
    (b)  The driver's liability under Subsection (1)(a)(iv) is limited to the insurance coverage.
            

    
    (2) (a)  A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection
            

    

31A-22-302

(1)(a) may:

collectible insurance;
            

    
    (ii)  grant any lawful coverage in addition to the required motor vehicle liability coverage;
            

    
    (iii)  if the policy is issued to a person other than a motor vehicle business, limit the coverage
            

    
afforded to a motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits
            

    
under Section 

31A-22-304

, and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible
            

    
insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or contingent;
            

    
and
            

    
    (iv)  if issued to a motor vehicle business, restrict coverage afforded to anyone other than the
            

    
motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits under Section
            

    

31A-22-304

, and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible insurance with at
            

    
least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or contingent.
            

    
    (b) (i)  The liability insurance coverage of a permissive user of a motor vehicle owned by a

- 2 -

            

    
motor vehicle business shall be primary coverage.
            

    
    (ii)  The liability insurance coverage of a motor vehicle business shall be secondary to the
            

    
liability insurance coverage of a permissive user as specified under Subsection (2)(b)(i).
            

    
    (3)  Motor vehicle liability coverage need not insure any liability:
            

    
    (a)  under any workers' compensation law under Title 34A;
            

    
    (b)  resulting from bodily injury to or death of an employee of the named insured, other than
            

    
a domestic employee, while engaged in the employment of the insured, or while engaged in the
            

    
operation, maintenance, or repair of a designated vehicle; or
            

    
    (c)  resulting from damage to property owned by, rented to, bailed to, or transported by the
            

    
insured.
            

    
    (4)  An insurance carrier providing motor vehicle liability coverage has the right to settle any
            

    
claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of the settlement
            

    
is deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section 

31A-22-304

.
            

    
    (5)  A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage imposes on the insurer the duty to
            

    
defend, in good faith, any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit seeking damages
            

    
which would be payable under the policy.
            

    
    (6) (a)  If a policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage provides an insurer with the
            

    
defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured, that defense is not effective against a third
            

    
person making a claim against the insurer, unless there was collusion between the third person and
            

    
the insured.
            

    
    (b)  If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant, after payment,
            

    
the insurer is subrogated to the injured person's claim against the insured to the extent of the payment
            

    
and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has been made whole
            

    
with respect to the claim against the insured.
            

    
    (7)  A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection 

31A-22-302

(1) may
            

    
specifically exclude from coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured's household,
            

    
including a person who usually makes his home in the same household but temporarily lives
            

    
elsewhere, if each person excluded from coverage satisfies the owner's or operator's security

- 3 -

            

    
requirement of Section 

41-12a-301

, independently of the named insured's proof of owner's or
            

    
operator's security.
            

    
    (8)  A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage may limit coverage to the policy minimum
            

    
limits under Section 

31A-22-304

 if the insured motor vehicle is operated by a person who has
            

    
consumed any alcohol or any illegal drug or illegal substance if the policy or a specifically reduced
            

    
premium was extended to the insured upon express written declaration executed by the insured that
            

    
the insured motor vehicle would not be so operated.
