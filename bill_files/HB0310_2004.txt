23

    

            
24

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
25

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
78-45-7.5

 is amended to read:
            
26

    
     78-45-7.5.  Determination of gross income -- Imputed income.
            
27

    
    (1)  As used in the guidelines, "gross income" includes:

            
28


    
    (a)  prospective income from any source, including nonearned sources, except under
            
29

    
Subsection (3); and
            
30

    
    (b)  income from salaries, wages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, rents, gifts from
            
31

    
anyone, prizes, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, alimony from
            
32

    
previous marriages, annuities, capital gains, Social Security benefits, workers' compensation
            
33

    
benefits, unemployment compensation, income replacement disability insurance benefits, and
            
34

    
payments from "nonmeans-tested" government programs.
            
35

    
    (2)  Income from earned income sources is limited to the equivalent of one full-time
            
36

    
40-hour job.  However, if and only if during the time prior to the original support order, the
            
37

    
parent normally and consistently worked more than 40 hours at [his] the parent's job, the court
            
38

    
may consider this extra time as a pattern in calculating the parent's ability to provide child
            
39

    
support.
            
40

    
    (3)  Specifically excluded from gross income are:
            
41

    
    (a) cash assistance provided under Title 35A, Chapter 3, Part 3, Family Employment
            
42

    
Program;
            
43

    
    (b)  benefits received under a housing subsidy program, the Job Training Partnership
            
44

    
Act,  Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, Food
            
45

    
Stamps, or General Assistance; and
            
46

    
    (c)  other similar means-tested welfare benefits received by a parent.
            
47

    
    (4) (a)  Gross income from self-employment or operation of a business shall be
            
48

    
calculated by subtracting necessary expenses required for self-employment or business
            
49

    
operation from gross receipts.  The income and expenses from self-employment or operation of
            
50

    
a business shall be reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the
            
51

    
parent to satisfy a child support award.  Only those expenses necessary to allow the business to
            
52

    
operate at a reasonable level may be deducted from gross receipts.
            
53

    
    (b)  Gross income determined under this Subsection (4) may differ from the amount of
            
54

    
business income determined for tax purposes.
            
55

    
    (5) (a)  When possible, gross income should first be computed on an annual basis and
            
56

    
then recalculated to determine the average gross monthly income.
            
57

    
    (b)  Each parent shall provide verification of current income.  Each parent shall provide
            
58

    
year-to-date pay stubs or employer statements and complete copies of tax returns from at least

            
59


    
the most recent year unless the court finds the verification is not reasonably available. 
            
60

    
Verification of income from records maintained by the Department of Workforce Services may
            
61

    
be substituted for pay stubs, employer statements, and income tax returns.
            
62

    
    (c)  Historical and current earnings shall be used to determine whether an
            
63

    
underemployment or overemployment situation exists.
            
64

    
    (6)  Gross income includes income imputed to the parent under Subsection (7).
            
65

    
    (7) (a)  Income may not be imputed to a parent unless the parent stipulates to the
            
66

    
amount imputed, the party defaults, or, in contested cases, a hearing is held and a finding made
            
67

    
that the parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.
            
68

    
    (b)  If a parent is incarcerated for the commission of a criminal act, income is to be
            
69

    
imputed at the greater of either the requirements of Subsection (7)(c) or (d).
            
70

    
    [(b)] (c)  If income is imputed to a parent, the income shall be based upon employment
            
71

    
potential and probable earnings as derived from work history, occupation qualifications, and
            
72

    
prevailing earnings for persons of similar backgrounds in the community, or the median
            
73

    
earning for persons in the same occupation in the same geographical area as found in the
            
74

    
statistics maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
            
75

    
    [(c)] (d)  If a parent has no recent work history or [their] the parent's occupation is
            
76

    
unknown, income shall be imputed at least at the federal minimum wage for a 40-hour work
            
77

    
week.  To impute a greater income, the judge in a judicial proceeding or the presiding officer in
            
78

    
an administrative proceeding shall enter specific findings of fact as to the evidentiary basis for
            
79

    
the imputation.
            
80

    
    [(d)] (e)  Income may not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist:
            
81

    
    (i)  the reasonable costs of child care for the parents' minor children approach or equal
            
82

    
the amount of income the custodial parent can earn;
            
83

    
    (ii)  a parent is physically or mentally disabled to the extent [he] the parent cannot earn
            
84

    
minimum wage;
            
85

    
    (iii)  a parent is engaged in career or occupational training to establish basic job skills;
            
86

    
or
            
87

    
    (iv)  unusual emotional or physical needs of a child require the custodial parent's
            
88

    
presence in the home.
            
89

    
    (8) (a)  Gross income may not include the earnings of a minor child who is the subject

            
90


    
of a child support award nor benefits to a minor child in the child's own right such as
            
91

    
Supplemental Security Income.
            
92

    
    (b)  Social Security benefits received by a child due to the earnings of a parent shall be
            
93

    
credited as child support to the parent upon whose earning record it is based, by crediting the
            
94

    
amount against the potential obligation of that parent.  Other unearned income of a child may
            
95

    
be considered as income to a parent depending upon the circumstances of each case.
