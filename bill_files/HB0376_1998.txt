15    Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

16        Section 1.  Section  31A-2-203 is amended to read:

17         31A-2-203.  Examinations and alternatives.

18        (1) (a)  Whenever the commissioner considers it necessary in order to inform himself about

19    any matter related to the enforcement of this title, the commissioner may examine the affairs and

20    condition of:

21        (i)  a licensee under this title;

22        (ii)  an applicant for a license under this title;

23        (iii)  a person or organization of persons doing or in process of organizing to do an

24    insurance business in this state; or

25        (iv)  a person who is not, but should be, licensed under this title.

26        (b)  When reasonably necessary for an examination under Subsection (1)(a), the

27    commissioner may examine the accounts, records, documents, or evidences of transactions of the

28    insurer or other licensee, so far as they relate to the examinee, of any officer or other person who

29    has executive authority over or is in charge of any segment of the examinee's affairs, or of any

30    affiliate of the examinee.

31        (c)  On demand, each examinee under Subsection (1)(a) shall make available to the

- 3 -


1    commissioner for examination any of its own accounts, records, files, documents, or evidences of

2    transactions and, to the extent reasonably necessary for an examination, those of any persons under

3    Subsection (1)(b).  Failure to make these documents available is concealment of records under

4    Subsection 31A-27-307(7).  However, if the examinee is unable to obtain accounts, records, files,

5    documents, or evidences of transactions from persons under Subsection (1)(b), that failure is not

6    concealment if the examinee immediately terminates the relationship with the other person.

7        (d)  Neither the commissioner nor an examiner may remove any account, record, file,

8    document, evidence of transaction, or other property of the examinee from the examinee's offices

9    unless the examinee consents in writing or a court grants permission.  The commissioner may,

10    however, make and remove copies or abstracts of the account, record, file, document, or evidence

11    of transaction.

12        (2) (a)  The commissioner shall examine every insurer, both domestic and nondomestic,

13    and every licensed rate service organization, as needed and as otherwise required by law.  The

14    commissioner shall examine insurers, both domestic and nondomestic, no less frequently than once

15    every five years, but the commissioner may use "in lieu" examinations under Subsection (4) to

16    satisfy this requirement.

17        (b)  The commissioner shall revoke the certificate of authority of an insurer or the license

18    of a rate service organization that has not been examined, or submitted an acceptable "in lieu"

19    report under Subsection (4), within the past five years.

20        (c)  Any 25 persons who are policyholders, shareholders, or creditors of a domestic insurer

21    may by verified petition demand a hearing under Section 31A-2-301 to determine whether the

22    commissioner should conduct an unscheduled examination of the insurer.  Persons demanding the

23    hearing shall be given an opportunity in the hearing to present evidence that an examination of the

24    insurer is necessary. If the evidence justifies an examination, the commissioner shall order one.

25        (d)  When the board of directors of a domestic insurer requests that the commissioner

26    examine the insurer, the commissioner shall examine the insurer as soon as reasonably possible. 

27    If the requested examination is conducted within two years after completion of a comprehensive

28    examination by the commissioner, costs of the requested examination may not be deducted from

29    premium taxes under Section 59-9-102 unless the commissioner's order specifically provides for

30    the deduction.

31        (e)  Bail bond surety companies as defined in Section 31A-35-102 are exempted from the

- 4 -


1    five-year examination requirement in Subsection (2)(a), the revocation under Subsection (2)(b),

2    and Subsections (2)(c) and (2)(d).

3        (3)  In lieu of all or part of an examination under Subsections (1) and (2), or in addition to

4    it, the commissioner may order an independent audit or examination by technical experts,

5    including certified public accountants and actuaries.  Any audit or evaluation under this Subsection 

6    (3) is subject to Subsection (5), Section 31A-2-204, and Subsection 31A-2-205(4).

7        (4) (a)  In lieu of all or any part of an examination under this section, the commissioner

8    may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance department of another state,

9    another government agency in this state, the federal government, or other state.

10        (b)  An examination by the commissioner under Subsection (1) or (2) or accepted by the

11    commissioner under Subsection (4) may use:

12        (i)  an audit already made by a certified public accountant; or

13        (ii)  an actuarial evaluation made by an actuary approved by the commissioner.

14        (5) (a)  An examination may be comprehensive or limited with respect to the examinee's

15    affairs and condition.  The commissioner shall determine the nature and scope of each

16    examination, taking into account all relevant factors, including:

17        (i)  the length of time the examinee has been licensed in this state;

18        (ii)  the nature of the business being examined;

19        (iii)  the nature of the accounting records available; and

20        (iv)  the nature of examinations performed elsewhere.

21        (b)  The examination of an alien insurer shall be limited to insurance transactions and assets

22    in the United States, unless the commissioner orders otherwise after finding that extraordinary

23    circumstances necessitate a broader examination.

24        (6)  To effectively administer this section, the commissioner shall:

25        (a)  maintain an effective financial condition surveillance system, including review of

26    insurance regulatory information system reports;

27        (b)  employ a priority scheduling method that focuses on insurers most in need of

28    examination; and

29        (c)  use examination management techniques similar to those outlined in the Financial

30    Condition Examination Handbook of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

31        Section 2.  Section  31A-2-308 is amended to read:

- 5 -

4    violation, in addition to any other forfeiture or penalty imposed.

5        (b) (i)  The commissioner may order an individual agent, broker, adjuster, or insurance

6    consultant who violates an insurance statute or rule to forfeit to the state not more than $2,500 for

7    each violation.

8        (ii)  The commissioner may order any other person who violates an insurance statute or rule

9    to forfeit to the state not more than $5,000 for each violation.

10        (c) (i)  The commissioner may order an individual agent, broker, adjuster, or insurance

11    consultant who violates an order issued under Subsection 31A-2-201(4) to forfeit to the state not

12    more than  $2,500 for each violation.  Each day the violation continues is a separate violation.

13        (ii)  The commissioner may order any other person who violates an order issued under

14    Subsection 31A-2-201(4) to forfeit to the state not more than $5,000 for each violation.  Each day

15    the violation continues is a separate violation.

16        (d)  The commissioner may accept or compromise any forfeiture under this subsection until

17    after a complaint is filed under Subsection (2). After the filing of the complaint, only the attorney

18    general may compromise the forfeiture.

19        (2)  Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under Subsection

20    31A-2-201(4), including a forfeiture order, the commissioner may file an action in any court of

21    competent jurisdiction or obtain a court order or judgment:

22        (a)  enforcing the commissioner's order;

23        (b)  directing compliance with the commissioner's order and restraining further violation

24    of the order, subjecting the person ordered to the procedures and sanctions available to the court

25    for punishing contempt if the failure to comply continues; or

26        (c)  imposing a forfeiture in an amount the court considers just, up to $10,000 for each day

27    the failure to comply continues after the filing of the complaint until judgment is rendered.

28        (3)  The Utah Rules of Civil Procedure govern actions brought under Subsection (2), except

29    that the commissioner may file a complaint seeking a court-ordered forfeiture under Subsection

30    (2)(c) no sooner than two weeks after giving written notice of his intention to proceed under

31    Subsection (2)(c).  The commissioner's order issued under Subsection 31A-2-201(4) may contain

- 6 -


1    a notice of intention to seek a court-ordered forfeiture if the commissioner's order is disobeyed.

2        (4)  If, after a court order is issued under Subsection (2), the person fails to comply with

3    the commissioner's order or judgment, the commissioner may certify the fact of the failure to the

4    court by affidavit, and the court may, after a hearing following at least five days written notice to

5    the parties subject to the order or judgment, amend the order or judgment to add the forfeiture or

6    forfeitures, as prescribed in Subsection (2)(c), until the person complies.

7        (5)  The proceeds of all forfeitures under this section, including collection expenses, shall

8    be paid into the General Fund.  The expenses of collection shall be credited to the Insurance

9    Department's budget. The attorney general's budget shall be credited to the extent the Insurance

10    Department reimburses the attorney general's office for its collection expenses under this section.

11        (6)  Forfeitures and judgments under this section bear interest at the rate then charged by

12    the United States Internal Revenue Service for past due taxes. Interest accrues from the later of the

13    date of entry of the commissioner's order under Subsection (1) or the date of judgment under

14    Subsection (2) until the forfeiture and accrued interest are fully paid.

15        (7)  No forfeiture may be imposed under Subsection (2)(c) if, at the time the forfeiture

16    action is commenced, the person was in compliance with the commissioner's order, or if the

17    violation of the order occurred during the order's suspension.

18        (8)  The commissioner may seek an injunction as an alternative to issuing an order under

19    Subsection 31A-2-201(4).

20        (9)  A person who intentionally violates, intentionally permits any person over whom he

21    has authority to violate, or intentionally aids any person in violating any insurance statute or rule

22    of this state or any effective order issued under Subsection 31A-2-201(4) is guilty of a class B

23    misdemeanor.  Unless a specific criminal penalty is provided elsewhere in this title, the person

24    may be fined not more than $10,000 if a corporation or not more than $5,000 if a person other than

25    a corporation.  If the person is an individual, the person may, in addition, be imprisoned for up to

26    one year.  As used in this subsection, "intentionally" has the same meaning as under Subsection

27    76-2-103(1).

28        (10)  When a licensee of the Insurance Department, other than a domestic insurer,

29    persistently or substantially violates the insurance law or violates an order of the commissioner

30    under Subsection 31A-2-201(4), if there are grounds for delinquency proceedings against the

31    licensee under Section 31A-27-301 or Section 31A-27-307, or if the licensee's methods and

- 7 -


1    practices in the conduct of his business endanger, or his financial resources are inadequate to

2    safeguard, the legitimate interests of his customers and the public, the commissioner may, after

3    a hearing, in whole or in part, revoke, suspend, place on probation, limit, or refuse to renew the

4    licensee's license or certificate of authority. Additional license termination or probation provisions

5    for licensees other than insurers are set forth in Sections 31A-19-303, 31A-19-304, 31A-23-216,

6    31A-23-217, 31A-25-208, 31A-25-209, 31A-26-213, [and] 31A-26-214, 31A-35-501, and

7    31A-35-503.

8        (11)  The enforcement penalties and procedures set forth in this section are not exclusive,

9    but are cumulative of other rights and remedies the commissioner has pursuant to applicable law.

10        Section 3.  Section  31A-4-102 is amended to read:

11         31A-4-102.  Qualified insurers.
