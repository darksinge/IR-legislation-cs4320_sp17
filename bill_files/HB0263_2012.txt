36

    
     35A-4-307.  Social costs -- Relief of charges.
            
37

    
    (1)  Social costs shall consist of those benefit costs defined as follows:
            
38

    
    (a)  Benefit costs of an individual will not be charged to a base-period employer, but
            
39

    
will be considered social costs if the individual's separation from that employer occurred under
            
40

    
any of the following circumstances:
            
41

    
    (i)  the individual was discharged by the employer or voluntarily quit employment with
            
42

    
the employer for disqualifying reasons, but subsequently requalified for benefits and actually
            
43

    
received benefits;
            
44

    
    (ii)  the individual received benefits following a quit which was not attributable to the
            
45

    
employer;
            
46

    
    (iii)  the individual received benefits following a discharge for nonperformance due to
            
47

    
medical reasons; [or]
            
48

    
    (iv)  the individual received benefits while attending the first week of mandatory
            
49

    
apprenticeship training[.]; or
            
50

    
    (v)  the individual received benefits after quitting voluntarily to accompany or follow a
            
51

    
spouse who is a member of the United States armed forces as described in Subsection
            
52

    


35A-4-405

(1)(e).
            
53

    
    (b)  Social costs are benefit costs which are or have been charged to employers who
            
54

    
have terminated coverage and are no longer liable for contributions, less the amount of
            
55

    
contributions paid by such employers during the same time period.
            
56

    
    (c)  The difference between the benefit charges of all employers whose benefit ratio
            
57

    
exceeds the maximum overall contribution rate and the amount determined by multiplying the
            
58

    
taxable payroll of the same employers by the maximum overall contribution rate is a social

            
59


    
cost.
            
60

    
    (d)  Benefit costs attributable to a concurrent base-period employer will not be charged
            
61

    
to that employer if the individual's customary hours of work for that employer have not been
            
62

    
reduced.
            
63

    
    (e)  Benefit costs incurred during the course of division-approved training which occurs

after December 31, 1985, will not be charged to base-period employers.
            
65

    
    (f)  Benefit costs will not be charged to employers if such costs are attributable to:
            
66

    
    (i)  the state's share of extended benefits;
            
67

    
    (ii)  uncollectible benefit overpayments;
            
68

    
    (iii)  the proportion of benefit costs of combined wage claims that are chargeable to
            
69

    
Utah employers and are insufficient when separately considered for a monetary eligible claim
            
70

    
under Utah law and which have been transferred to a paying state; and
            
71

    
    (iv)  benefit costs attributable to wages used in a previous benefit year that are available
            
72

    
for a second benefit year under Subsection 

35A-4-401

(2) because of a change in method of
            
73

    
computing base-periods, overlapping base-periods, or for other reasons required by law.
            
74

    
    (g)  Any benefit costs that are not charged to an employer and not defined in this
            
75

    
subsection are also social costs.
            
76

    
    (2)  Subsection (1) applies only to contributing employers and not to employers that
            
77

    
have elected to finance the payment of benefits in accordance with Section 

35A-4-309

 or
            
78

    

35A-4-311

    Section 2.  
Section  
35A-4-405

80

    
     35A-4-405.  Ineligibility for benefits.
            
81

    
    Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (5), an individual is ineligible for benefits
            
82

    
or for purposes of establishing a waiting period:
            
83

    
    (1) (a)  For the week in which the claimant left work voluntarily without good cause, if
            
84

    
so found by the division, and for each week thereafter until the claimant has performed services
            
85

    
in bona fide, covered employment and earned wages for those services equal to at least six
            
86

    
times the claimant's weekly benefit amount.
            
87

    
    (b)  A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits if the claimant leaves work
            
88

    
under circumstances where it would be contrary to equity and good conscience to impose a
            
89

    
disqualification.

            
90


    
    (c)  Using available information from employers and the claimant, the division shall
            
91

    
consider for the purposes of this chapter the reasonableness of the claimant's actions, and the
            
92

    
extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing attachment to the labor market in
            
93

    
reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a claimant is contrary to equity and
            
94

    
good conscience.
            
95

    
    (d)  [Notwithstanding any other subsection of this section] Except as provided in
            
96

    
Subsection (1)(e), a claimant who has left work voluntarily to accompany[,] or follow[, or join]
            
97

    
the claimant's spouse to [or in] a new locality does so without good cause for purposes of this
            
98

    
Subsection (1).
            
99

    
    (e)  A claimant who has left work voluntarily to accompany or follow the claimant's
            
100

    
spouse to a new locality does so with good cause for purposes of this Subsection (1) and is
            
101

    
eligible to receive benefits if:
            
102

    
    (i)  the claimant's spouse is a member of the United States armed forces and the
            
103

    
claimant's spouse has been relocated by a full-time assignment scheduled to last at least 180
            
104

    
days while on:
            
105

    
    (A)  active duty as defined in 10 U.S.C. Sec. 101(d)(1); or
            
106

    
    (B)  active guard or reserve duty as defined in 10 U.S.C. Sec. 101(d)(6);
            
107

    
    (ii)  it is impractical as determined by the division for the claimant to commute to the
            
108

    
previous work from the new locality;
            
109

    
    (iii)  the claimant left work voluntarily no earlier than 15 days before the scheduled start
            
110

    
date of the spouse's active-duty assignment; and
            
111

    
    (iv)  the claimant otherwise meets and follows the eligibility and reporting requirements
            
112

    
of this chapter, including registering for work with the division or, if the claimant has relocated
            
113

    
to another state, the equivalent agency of that state.
            
114

    
    (2) (a)  For the week in which the claimant was discharged for just cause or for an act or
            
115

    
omission in connection with employment, not constituting a crime, which is deliberate, willful,
            
116

    
or wanton and adverse to the employer's rightful interest, if so found by the division, and
            
117

    
thereafter until the claimant has earned an amount equal to at least six times the claimant's
            
118

    
weekly benefit amount in bona fide covered employment.
            
119

    
    (b)  For the week in which the claimant was discharged for dishonesty constituting a
            
120

    
crime or any felony or class A misdemeanor in connection with the claimant's work as shown

            
121


    
by the facts, together with the claimant's admission, or as shown by the claimant's conviction of
            
122

    
that crime in a court of competent jurisdiction and for the 51 next following weeks.
            
123

    
    (c)  Wage credits shall be deleted from the claimant's base period, and are not available
            
124

    
for this or any subsequent claim for benefits.
            
125

    
    (3) (a) (i)  If the division finds that the claimant has failed without good cause to
            
126

    
properly apply for available suitable work, to accept a referral to suitable work offered by the
            
127

    
employment office, or to accept suitable work offered by an employer or the employment
            
128

    
office.
            
129

    
    (ii)  The ineligibility continues until the claimant has performed services in bona fide
            
130

    
covered employment and earned wages for the services in an amount equal to at least six times
            
131

    
the claimant's weekly benefit amount.
            
132

    
    (b) (i)  A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits for failure to apply, accept
            
133

    
referral, or accept available suitable work under circumstances where it would be contrary to
            
134

    
equity and good conscience to impose a disqualification.
            
135

    
    (ii)  The division shall consider the purposes of this chapter, the reasonableness of the
            
136

    
claimant's actions, and the extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing
            
137

    
attachment to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a
            
138

    
claimant is contrary to equity and good conscience.
            
139

    
    (c)  In determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the division shall
            
140

    
consider the:
            
141

    
    (i)  degree of risk involved to his health, safety, and morals;
            
142

    
    (ii)  individual's physical fitness and prior training;
            
143

    
    (iii)  individual's prior earnings and experience;
            
144

    
    (iv)  individual's length of unemployment;
            
145

    
    (v)  prospects for securing local work in his customary occupation;
            
146

    
    (vi)  wages for similar work in the locality; and
            
147

    
    (vii)  distance of the available work from his residence.
            
148

    
    (d)  Prior earnings shall be considered on the basis of all four quarters used in
            
149

    
establishing eligibility and not just the earnings from the most recent employer.  The division
            
150

    
shall be more prone to find work as suitable the longer the claimant has been unemployed and
            
151

    
the less likely the prospects are to secure local work in his customary occupation.

            
152


    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work is suitable, and
            
153

    
benefits may not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing
            
154

    
to accept new work under any of the following conditions:
            
155

    
    (i)  if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor
            
156

    
dispute;
            
157

    
    (ii)  if the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less
            
158

    
favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; or
            
159

    
    (iii)  if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a
            
160

    
company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.
            
161

    
    (4)  For any week in which the division finds that the claimant's unemployment is due
            
162

    
to a stoppage of work that exists because of a strike involving the claimant's grade, class, or
            
163

    
group of workers at the factory or establishment at which the claimant is or was last employed.
            
164

    
    (a)  If the division finds that a strike has been fomented by a worker of any employer,
            
165

    
none of the workers of the grade, class, or group of workers of the individual who is found to
            
166

    
be a party to the plan, or agreement to foment a strike, shall be eligible for benefits.  However,
            
167

    
if the division finds that the strike is caused by the failure or refusal of any employer to
            
168

    
conform to any law of the state or of the United States pertaining to hours, wages, or other
            
169

    
conditions of work, the strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.
            
170

    
    (b)  If the division finds that the employer, the employer's agent or representative has
            
171

    
conspired, planned, or agreed with any of the employer's workers, their agents or
            
172

    
representatives to foment a strike, that strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.
            
173

    
    (c)  A worker may receive benefits if, subsequent to the worker's unemployment
            
174

    
because of a strike as defined in this Subsection (4), the worker has obtained employment and
            
175

    
has been paid wages of not less than the amount specified in Subsection 

35A-4-401

(4) and has
            
176

    
worked as specified in Subsection 

35A-4-403

(1)(f).  During the existence of the stoppage of
            
177

    
work due to this strike the wages of the worker used for the determination of his benefit rights
            
178

    
may not include any wages the worker earned from the employer involved in the strike.
            
179

    
    (5) (a)  For each week with respect to which the claimant willfully made a false
            
180

    
statement or representation or knowingly failed to report a material fact to obtain any benefit
            
181

    
under the provisions of this chapter, and an additional 13 weeks for the first week the statement
            
182

    
or representation was made or fact withheld and six weeks for each week thereafter; the

            
183


    
additional weeks not to exceed 49 weeks.
            
184

    
    (b)  The additional period shall commence on the Sunday following the issuance of a
            
185

    
determination finding the claimant in violation of this Subsection (5).
            
186

    
    (c) (i)  Each claimant found in violation of this Subsection (5) shall repay to the
            
187

    
division the overpayment and, as a civil penalty, an amount equal to the overpayment.
            
188

    
    (ii)  The overpayment is the amount of benefits the claimant received by direct reason
            
189

    
of fraud.
            
190
