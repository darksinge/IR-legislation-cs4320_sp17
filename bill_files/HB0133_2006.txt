    Section 3.  
Section  
13-32a-109

 is amended to read:
            
78

    
     13-32a-109.  Holding period for pawned articles.
            
79

    
    (1) (a)  The pawnbroker shall hold all articles pawned [or sold] to him for not fewer
            
80

    
than 30 days after the date of receipt of the article, except that the pawnbroker may within this
            
81

    
time period return an article to the person who pawned it.
            
82

    
    (b)  [This] Subsection (1)(a) does not preclude a law enforcement agency from
            
83

    
requiring a pawnbroker to hold an article longer than 30 days if necessary in the course of an
            
84

    
investigation.
            
85

    
    (2)  If a law enforcement agency seizes an article or requires the pawnbroker to hold an
            
86

    
article as part of an investigation, the agency shall provide to the pawnbroker a hold ticket
            
87

    
issued by the agency, which:
            
88

    
    (a)  states the active case number;
            
89

    
    (b)  confirms the date of the hold request and the article to be held; and

            
90


    
    (c)  facilitates the pawnbroker's ability to track the article when the prosecution takes
            
91

    
over the case.
            
92

    
    (3)  If an article is not seized by a law enforcement agency that has placed a hold on the
            
93

    
property, the property may remain in the custody of the pawnbroker until further disposition by
            
94

    
the law enforcement agency, and as consistent with this chapter.
            
95

    
    (4)  The initial hold by a law enforcement agency is for a period of 45 days.  If the
            
96

    
article is not seized by the law enforcement agency, the article shall remain in the custody of
            
97

    
the pawnshop and is subject to the hold unless exigent circumstances require the pawned article
            
98

    
to be seized by the law enforcement agency.
            
99

    
    (5) (a)  A law enforcement agency may extend any hold for up to an additional 45 days
            
100

    
when exigent circumstances require the extension.
            
101

    
    (b)  When there is an extension of a hold under Subsection (5)(a), the requesting law
            
102

    
enforcement agency shall notify the pawnshop subject to the hold prior to the expiration of the
            
103

    
initial 45 days.
            
104

    
    (c)  A law enforcement agency may not hold an item for more than the 90 days allowed
            
105

    
under Subsections (5)(a) and (b) without obtaining a court order authorizing the hold.
            
106

    
    (6)  A hold on an article under Subsection (2) takes precedence over any request to
            
107

    
claim or purchase the article subject to the hold.
            
108

    
    (7)  When the purpose for the hold on or seizure of an article is terminated, the law
            
109

    
enforcement agency requiring the hold or seizure shall within 15 days after the termination:
            
110

    
    (a)  notify the pawnshop in writing that the hold or seizure has been terminated;
            
111

    
    (b)  return the article subject to the seizure to the pawnbroker; or
            
112

    
    (c)  if the article is not returned to the pawnbroker, advise the pawnbroker either in
            
113

    
writing or electronically of the specific alternative disposition of the article.
            
114

    
    (8)  If the article is subject to an investigation and a criminal prosecution results, the
            
115

    
prosecuting agency shall, upon disposition of the case, request restitution to the pawnbroker for
            
116

    
the crimes perpetrated against the pawnshop as a victim of theft by deception in addition to the
            
117

    
request for restitution to the original victim.
            
118

    
    (9)  If the original victim of the theft of the property files a police report and the
            
119

    
property is subsequently located at a pawnshop, the victim must fully cooperate with the
            
120

    
prosecution of the crimes perpetrated against the pawnshop as a victim of theft by deception, in

            
121


    
order to qualify for restitution regarding the property.
            
122

    
    (10)  If the victim does not wish to pursue criminal charges or does not cooperate in the
            
123

    
prosecution of the property theft against the defendant and the theft by deception committed
            
124

    
against the pawnshop, then the original victim must pay to the pawnshop the amount of money
            
125

    
financed by the pawnshop to the defendant in order to obtain the property.
            
126

    
    (11) (a)  The victim's cooperation in the prosecution of the property crimes and in the
            
127

    
prosecution of the theft by deception offense committed against the pawnshop suspends the
            
128

    
requirements of Subsections (9) and (10).
            
129

    
    (b)  If the victim cooperates in the prosecution under Subsection (11)(a) and the
            
130

    
defendants are convicted, the prosecuting agency shall direct the pawnshop to turn over the
            
131

    
property to the victim.
            
132

    
    (c)  Upon receipt of notice from the prosecuting agency that the property must be turned
            
133

    
over to the victim, the pawnshop shall return the property to the victim as soon as reasonably
            
134

    
possible.
            
135

    
    (12)  A pawnshop must fully cooperate in the prosecution of the property crimes
            
136

    
committed against the original victim and the property crime of theft by deception committed
            
137

    
against the pawnshop in order to participate in any court-ordered restitution.
            
138

    
    (13)  At all times during the course of a criminal investigation and subsequent
            
139

    
prosecution, the article subject to a law enforcement hold shall be kept secure by the pawnshop
            
140

    
subject to the hold unless the pawned article has been seized by the law enforcement agency.
            
141
