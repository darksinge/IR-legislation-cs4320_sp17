If the proceedings are in a court other than the district court in which the65     petition is filed, the district court shall notify that court of the filing of the petition.66          (b)  The district court in which the petition is filed:67          (i)  shall review the allegations of incompetency;68          (ii)  may hold a limited hearing solely for the purpose of determining the sufficiency of69     the petition if the court finds the petition is not clearly sufficient on its face;70          (iii)  shall hold a hearing if the petition is opposed by either party;71          (iv)  may not order an examination of the defendant or order a hearing on the mental72     condition of the defendant unless the court finds that the allegations in the petition raise a bona73     fide doubt as to the defendant's competency to stand trial; and74          (v)  shall order an examination of the defendant and a hearing on the defendant's mental75     condition if the court finds that the allegations raise a bona fide doubt as to the defendant's76     competency to stand trial.77          (2) (a)  After the granting of a petition and prior to a full competency hearing, the court78     may order the Department of Human Services to examine the person and to report to the court79     concerning the defendant's mental condition.80          (b)  The defendant shall be examined by at least two mental health experts not involved81     in the current treatment of the defendant.82          (c)  If the issue is sufficiently raised in the petition or if it becomes apparent that the83     defendant may be incompetent due to [mental retardation] intellectual disability, at least one84     expert experienced in [mental retardation] intellectual disability assessment shall evaluate the85     defendant.

The133     report shall inform the court of the examiner's opinion concerning the competency of the134     defendant to stand trial, or, in the alternative, the examiner may inform the court in writing that135     additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the examiner informs the court that136     additional time is needed, the examiner shall have up to an additional 30 days to provide the137     report to the court and counsel.  The examiner shall provide the report within 60 days from the138     receipt of the court's order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional139     period of time to complete the examination and provide the report.140          (7)  Any written report submitted by the experts shall:141          (a)  identify the specific matters referred for evaluation;142          (b)  describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination and the143     purpose or purposes for each;144          (c)  state the expert's clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue referred145     for examination by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the expert146     could not give an opinion; and147          (d)  identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the basis for the148     expert's clinical findings and opinions.149          (8) (a)  Any statement made by the defendant in the course of any competency150     examination, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, any151     testimony by the expert based upon the statement, and any other fruits of the statement may not152     be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue153     respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.  The evidence154     may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the defendant's competency.155          (b)  Prior to examining the defendant, examiners should specifically advise the156     defendant of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection (8)(a).157          (9) (a)  When the report is received the court shall set a date for a mental hearing.  The158     hearing shall be held in not less than five and not more than 15 days, unless the court enlarges159     the time for good cause.160          (b)  Any person or organization directed by the department to conduct the examination161     may be subpoenaed to testify at the hearing.  If the experts are in conflict as to the competency162     of the defendant, all experts should be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably available.  A163     conflict in the opinions of the experts does not require the appointment of an additional expert164     unless the court determines the appointment to be necessary.165          (c)  The court may call any examiner to testify at the hearing who is not called by the166     parties.  If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross-examine the expert.167          (10) (a)  A person shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of168     the evidence, finds the person incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the169     proponent of incompetency at the hearing.170          (b)  An adjudication of incompetency to proceed does not operate as an adjudication of171     incompetency to give informed consent for medical treatment or for any other purpose, unless172     specifically set forth in the court order.173          (11)  In determining the defendant's competency to stand trial, the court shall consider174     the totality of the circumstances, which may include the testimony of lay witnesses, in addition175     to the expert testimony, studies, and reports provided under this section.176          (12) (a)  If the court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, its order shall177     contain findings addressing each of the factors in Subsections (4)(a) and (b).  The order issued178     pursuant to Subsection 77-15-6(1) which the court sends to the facility where the defendant is179     committed or to the person who is responsible for assessing the defendant's progress toward180     competency shall be provided contemporaneously with the transportation and commitment181     order of the defendant, unless exigent circumstances require earlier commitment in which case182     the court shall forward the order within five working days of the order of transportation and183     commitment of the defendant.184          (b)  The order finding the defendant incompetent to stand trial shall be accompanied by:185          (i)  copies of the reports of the experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of186     examination if not provided previously;187          (ii)  copies of any of the psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports submitted to188     the court relative to the mental condition of the defendant; and189          (iii)  any other documents made available to the court by either the defense or the190     prosecution, pertaining to the defendant's current or past mental condition.191          (13) (a)  If the court finds it necessary to order the defendant transported prior to the192     completion of findings and compilation of documents required under Subsection (12), the193     transportation and commitment order delivering the defendant to the Utah State Hospital, or194     other mental health facility as directed by the executive director of the Department of Human195     Services or a designee, shall indicate that the defendant's commitment is based upon a finding196     of incompetency, and the mental health facility's copy of the order shall be accompanied by the197     reports of any experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of examination.198          (b)  The executive director of the Department of Human Services or a designee may199     refuse to accept a defendant as a patient unless the defendant is accompanied by a200     transportation and commitment order which is accompanied by the reports.201          (14)  Upon a finding of incompetency to stand trial by the court, the prosecuting and202     defense attorneys shall provide information and materials relevant to the defendant's203     competency to the facility where the defendant is committed or to the person responsible for204     assessing the defendant's progress towards competency.  In addition to any other materials, the205     prosecuting attorney shall provide:206          (a)  copies of the charging document and supporting affidavits or other documents used207     in the determination of probable cause;208          (b)  arrest or incident reports prepared by a law enforcement agency pertaining to the209     charged offense; and210          (c)  information concerning the defendant's known criminal history.211          (15)  The court may make any reasonable order to insure compliance with this section.212          (16)  Failure to comply with this section does not result in the dismissal of criminal213     charges.214          Section 3.
