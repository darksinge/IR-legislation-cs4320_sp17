DIVISION OF CONSTRUCTION SERVICES                                 GENERAL SESSION                          STATE OF UTAH                             Sponsor   Stephen D. Clark                             This act creates the Division of Construction Services within the Department of Commerce.                           The act eliminates licensing boards for construction trades.  The act creates the Construction                          Services Commission as a policy and licensing board for the division.  The act sets forth the                          manner of appointment and the authority, duties, and responsibilities of the division and its                          director.  The act sets forth the composition of the commission, the manner of appointment,                           qualifications, and terms of commission members, and the duties of the commission.  The act                           describes adjudicative proceedings.  The act sets forth licensure requirements and                           exemptions, disciplinary procedures, grounds for denial of license, and civil penalties.  The                           act eliminates the requirement that a licensee business entity have a qualifier licensee if the                           business entity has maintained its license and not violated the requirements of this chapter                           and certain predecessor statutory provisions for ten consecutive years.  The act renumbers                           and amends all of Title   , Chapter   , to transfer the regulation of construction trades from                           the Division of Professional Licensing to the newly created Division of Construction Services.

This notice shall advise the                           applicant that the application is incomplete and that the application is denied, unless the applicant                           corrects the deficiencies within the time period specified in the notice and otherwise meets all                           qualifications for licensure.                                     Before any person is issued a license under this chapter, all requirements for that                           license as established under this chapter and by reasonable rule shall be met.                                     If all requirements are met for the specific license, the division shall issue the license.                                Section   .

The division may issue a license without examination to a person who has been licensed                           in any state, district, or territory of the United States or in any foreign country, whose education,                           experience, and examination requirements are, or were at the time the license was issued, equal                           to those of this state.  Before any person may be issued a license under this section, the person shall                           produce satisfactory evidence of qualifications, identity, and good standing in the person s                           occupation or trade.                                Section   .    Section                  is enacted to read                                          .  Restricted license.                                     The division may issue a restricted license to an applicant for licensure, renewal, or                           reinstatement of licensure if                                  a   the applicant appears to meet the qualifications for licensure, but has engaged in                           unlawful, unprofessional, or other conduct bearing upon the applicant s qualifications  and                                 b   the division determines the need to observe the applicant in a monitored or supervised                           practice of the applicant s occupation or trade or to attach other reasonable restrictions upon the                           applicant in order to accommodate licensure, while protecting the public health, safety, and                              welfare.                                     Issuance of a restricted license is considered a partial denial of licensure that is subject                           to agency review.                                Section   .

The division may adopt reasonable rules permitting inactive licensure.  The rules shall                           specify the requirements and procedures for placing a license on inactive status, the length of time                           a license may remain on inactive status, and the requirements and procedures to activate an                           inactive license.                                     Except as otherwise specified by rule, an inactive licensee has no right or privilege to                           engage in the practice of the licensed occupation or profession.

The division may, by written agreement, accept the voluntary surrender of a license.                                     Unless otherwise stated in the written agreement, tender and acceptance of a voluntary                           surrender of a license does not foreclose the division from pursuing additional disciplinary or other                           action authorized under this chapter or in reasonable rules adopted under this chapter.                                     Unless otherwise stated in the written agreement, tender and acceptance of a voluntary                           surrender of a license terminates all rights and privileges associated with the license.                                     Unless otherwise stated in the written agreement, the surrendered rights and privileges                           of licensure may be reacquired only by reapplying for licensure and meeting the requirements for                           a new or reinstated license set forth under this chapter or in rules adopted under this chapter.                                     Unless otherwise stated in the written agreement, documentation of tender and                           acceptance of a voluntary surrender of a license is a public record.                                     Unless otherwise stated in the written agreement, when a tender and acceptance of a                           voluntary surrender of a license occurs while adjudicative proceedings are pending against the                           licensee for unprofessional or unlawful conduct, the division may report the surrender of license                           to appropriate state and federal agencies and licensing data banks.
