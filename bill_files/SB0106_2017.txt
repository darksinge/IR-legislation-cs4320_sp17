The issuing State Psychology Regulatory393     Authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the394     service statutes of the state where the witnesses and/or evidence are located; and395          2.

The Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses595     of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.596          2.  The Commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources and donations597     and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services.598          3.  The Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compact599     State or impose fees on other parties to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the600     Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover its annual budget601     as approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate602     annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the603     Commission which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all Compact States.604          4.  The Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds605     adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Commission pledge the credit of any of the Compact606     States, except by and with the authority of the Compact State.607          5.  The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The608     receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting609     procedures established under its Bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds610     handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant611     and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the612     Commission.613          G.  Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification614          1.  The members, officers, Executive Director, employees, and representatives of the615     Commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official616     capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil617     liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred,618     or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing619     occurred, within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided620     that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit and/or621     liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton622     misconduct of that person.623          2.  The Commission shall defend any member, officer, Executive Director, employee,624     or representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out625     of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission626     employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had627     a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties,628     or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from629     retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further that the actual or alleged act, error, or630     omission did not result from that person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.631          3.  The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, Executive632     Director, employee, or representative of the Commission for the amount of any settlement or633     judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or634     omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or635     responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the636     scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or637     alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton638     misconduct of that person.639     ARTICLE XI640     RULEMAKING641          A.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set642     forth in this Article and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become643     binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.644          B.  If a majority of the legislatures of the Compact States rejects a rule, by enactment of645     a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such rule shall have646     no further force and effect in any Compact State.647          C.  Rules or amendments to the Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of648     the Commission.649          D.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or Rules by the Commission, and650     at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted651     upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:652          1.  On the website of the Commission; and653          2.  On the website of each Compact States' Psychology Regulatory Authority or the654     publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.655          E.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:656          1.  The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be657     considered and voted upon;658          2.  The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;659          3.  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and660          4.  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of661     their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.662          F.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit663     written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.664          G.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a665     rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:666          1.  At least twenty-five (25) persons who submit comments independently of each667     other;668          2.  A governmental subdivision or agency; or669          3.  A duly appointed person in an association that has at least twenty-five (25)670     members.671          H.  If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the Commission shall672     publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.673          1.  All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the Executive Director of674     the Commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at675     the hearing not less than five (5) business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.676          2.  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to677     comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.678          3.  No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is679     made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the680     transcript. A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and conditions681     as a transcript. This subsection shall not preclude the Commission from making a transcript or682     recording of the hearing if it so chooses.683          4.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each684     rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this685     section.686          I.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled687     hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral688     comments received.689          J.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the690     proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking691     record and the full text of the rule.692          K.  If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is693     received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a694     public hearing.695          L.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and696     adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided697     that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be698     retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety699     (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency700     rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:701          1.  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;702          2.  Prevent a loss of Commission or Compact State funds;703          3.  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by704     federal law or rule; or705          4.  Protect public health and safety.706          M.  The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct707     revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical708     errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any709     revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to710     challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be711     challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge712     shall be made in writing and delivered to the Chair of the Commission prior to the end of the713     notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the714     revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the715     Commission.716     ARTICLE XII717     OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT718          A. Oversight719          1.  The Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of state government in each720     Compact State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to721     effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules722     promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.723          2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or724     administrative proceeding in a Compact State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact725     which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.726          3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such727     proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure728     to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the729     Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.730          B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination731          1.  If the Commission determines that a Compact State has defaulted in the performance732     of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the733     Commission shall:734          a.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other Compact States of the nature735     of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default, and/or any other action to be taken736     by the Commission; and737          b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.738          2.  If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated739     from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compact States, and all rights,740     privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated on the effective date of741     termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or742     liabilities incurred during the period of default.743          3.  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other744     means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate745     shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the746     defaulting state's legislature, and each of the Compact States.747          4.  A Compact State which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,748     obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including749     obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.750          5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be751     in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing752     between the Commission and the defaulting state.753          6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the754     U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its755     principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including756     reasonable attorney's fees.757          C.  Dispute Resolution758          1.  Upon request by a Compact State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes759     related to the Compact which arise among Compact States and between Compact and760     Non-Compact States.761          2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding762     dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the Commission.763          D.  Enforcement764          1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the765     provisions and Rules of this Compact.766          2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court767     for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices768     against a Compact State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact769     and its promulgated Rules and Bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and770     damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be771     awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.772          3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The773     Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.774     ARTICLE XIII775     DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PSYCHOLOGY776     INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED777     RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENTS778          A.  The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact is enacted779     into law in the seventh Compact State. The provisions which become effective at that time780     shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the781     promulgation of Rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers782     necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.783          B.  Any state which joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption784     of the Rules shall be subject to the Rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact785     becomes law in that state. Any rule which has been previously adopted by the Commission786     shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.787          C.  Any Compact State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute788     repealing the same.789          1.  A Compact State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after790     enactment of the repealing statute.791          2.  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's792     Psychology Regulatory Authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting793     requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.794          D.  Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any795     psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Compact State796     and a Non-Compact State which does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.797          E.  This Compact may be amended by the Compact States. No amendment to this798     Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Compact State until it is enacted into799     the law of all Compact States.800     ARTICLE XIV801     CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY802          This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If803     this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the804     Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Compact States.805          Section 3.  Section 58-61b-103 is enacted to read:806          58-61b-103. Rulemaking Authority.807          The division may make administrative rules in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3,808     Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, to implement Section 58-61b-102.
