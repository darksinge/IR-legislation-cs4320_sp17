 Requirements -- Storage in reservoir -- Information required by state engineer -- Lapse
            
29

    
 of application.
            
30

    
    (1)  Upon application in writing and approval of the state engineer, any appropriated
            
31

    
water may, for the purpose of preventing waste and facilitating distribution, be turned from the
            
32

    
channel of any stream or any lake or other body of water, into the channel of any natural stream
            
33

    
or natural body of water or into a reservoir constructed across the bed of any natural stream,
            
34

    
and commingled with its waters, and a like quantity less the quantity lost by evaporation and
            
35

    
seepage may be taken out, either above or below the point where emptied into the stream, body

37

    
must not be deteriorated in quality or diminished in quantity for the purpose used, and the
            
38

    
additional water turned in shall bear its share of the expense of maintenance of such reservoir
            
39

    
and an equitable proportion of the cost of the reservoir site and its construction. Any person
            
40

    
having stored [his] that person's appropriated water in a reservoir for a beneficial purpose shall
            
41

    
be permitted to withdraw the water at the times and in the quantities as [his] the person's

63

    
    (c)  the applicant has not complied with the conditions established in approving the
            
64

    
exchange; or
            
65
