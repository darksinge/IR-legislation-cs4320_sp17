135

    
sales and use tax license number on the invoice for the sale.
            
136

    
    (ii)  The receipt or invoice is prima facie evidence that the seller has collected the tax
            
137

138

    
consumer.
            
139

    
    (d)  A seller is not required to maintain a separate account for the tax collected, but is

    (f)  If any seller, during any reporting period, collects as a tax an amount in excess of
            
145

    
the lawful state and local percentage of total taxable sales allowed under this chapter, the seller
            
146

    
shall remit to the commission the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter, plus any
            
147

    
excess.
            
148

    
    (g)  If the accounting methods regularly employed by the seller in the transaction of the
            
149

    
seller's business are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month or quarterly period
            
150

    
will impose unnecessary hardships, the commission may accept reports at intervals that will, in
            
151

    
the commission's opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer or seller and will not

            
152


    
jeopardize collection of the tax.
            
153

    
    (3) (a)  Except as provided in Subsections (4) through (6) and Section

    (b) (i)  Each seller shall, on or before the last day of the month next succeeding each
            
157

    
calendar quarterly period, file with the commission a return for the preceding quarterly period.
            
158

    
    (ii)  The seller shall remit with the return under Subsection (3)(b)(i) the amount of the
            
159

    
tax required under this chapter to be collected or paid for the period covered by the return.
            
160

    
    (c)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(c), a return shall contain information and be in
            
161

    
a form the commission prescribes by rule.
            
162

    
    (d)  [The] (i)  Subject to Subsection (3)(d)(ii), the sales tax as computed in the return
            
163

    
shall be based [upon] on the total nonexempt sales made during the period[, including both
            
164

    
cash and charge sales] for which the return is filed, including both cash and charge sales.
            
165

    
    (ii)  For a sale that includes the delivery or installation of tangible personal property at a
            
166

    
location other than a seller's place of business described in Subsection (1)(a)(i), if the delivery
            
167

    
or installation is separately stated on an invoice or receipt, a seller may compute the tax due on
            
168

    
the sale for purposes of Subsection (3)(d)(i) based on the amount the seller receives for that
            
169

    
sale during each period for which the seller receives payment for the sale.
            
170

    
    (e)  The use tax as computed in the return shall be based [upon] on the total amount of
            
171

    
purchases for storage, use, or other consumption in this state made during the period[,
            
172

    
including both by cash and by charge] for which the return is filed, including both cash and
            
173

    
charge purchases.
            
174

    
    (f) (i)  Subject to Subsection (3)(f)(ii) and in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3,
            
175

    
Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, the commission may by rule extend the time for making

    (ii)  An extension under Subsection (3)(f)(i) may not be for more than 90 days.
            
178

    
    (g)  The commission may require returns and payment of the tax to be made for other
            
179

    
than quarterly periods if the commission considers it necessary in order to ensure the payment
            
180

    
of the tax imposed by this chapter.
            
181

    
    (h) (i)  The commission may require a seller that files a simplified electronic return with

    (ii)  In accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, the
            
184

    
commission may make rules providing:
            
185
