The employer's or insurance carrier's failure to diligently pursue the154     reemployment plan is cause for the administrative law judge on the administrative law judge's155     own motion to make a final decision of permanent total disability.156          (f)  If a preponderance of the evidence shows that successful rehabilitation is not157     possible, the administrative law judge shall order that the employee be paid weekly permanent158     total disability compensation benefits.159          (g)  If a preponderance of the evidence shows that pursuant to a reemployment plan, as160     prepared by a qualified rehabilitation provider and presented under Subsection (5)(e), an161     employee could immediately or without unreasonable delay return to work but for the162     following, an administrative law judge shall order that the employee be denied the payment of163     weekly permanent total disability compensation benefits:164          (i)  incarceration in a facility operated by or contracting with a federal, state, county, or165     municipal government to house a criminal offender in either a secure or nonsecure setting; or166          (ii)  not being legally eligible to be employed because of a reason unrelated to the167     impairment or combination of impairments.168          (6) (a)  The period of benefits commences on the date the employee acquired the169     permanent, total disability, as determined by a final order of the commission based on the facts170     and evidence, and ends:171          (i)  with the death of the employee; or172          (ii)  when the employee is capable of returning to regular, steady work.173          (b)  An employer or [its] the employer's insurance carrier may provide or locate for a174     permanently totally disabled employee reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work in a175     job earning at least minimum wage, except that the employee may not be required to accept the176     work to the extent that it would disqualify the employee from social security disability benefits.177          (c)  An employee shall:178          (i)  fully cooperate in the placement and employment process; and179          (ii)  accept the reasonable, medically appropriate, part-time work.180          (d)  In a consecutive four-week period when an employee's gross income from the work181     provided under Subsection (6)(b) exceeds $500, the employer or insurance carrier may reduce182     the employee's permanent total disability compensation by 50% of the employee's income in183     excess of $500.184          (e)  If a work opportunity is not provided by the employer or [its] the employer's185     insurance carrier, an employee with a permanent, total disability may obtain medically186     appropriate, part-time work subject to the offset provisions of Subsection (6)(d).187          (f) (i)  The commission shall establish rules regarding the part-time work and offset.188          (ii)  The adjudication of disputes arising under this Subsection (6) is governed by Part189     8, Adjudication.190          (g)  The employer or [its] the employer's insurance carrier has the burden of proof to191     show that medically appropriate part-time work is available.192          (h)  The administrative law judge may:193          (i)  excuse an employee from participation in any work:194          (A)  that would require the employee to undertake work exceeding the employee's:195          (I)  medical capacity; or196          (II)  residual functional capacity; or197          (B)  for good cause; or198          (ii)  allow the employer or [its] the employer's insurance carrier to reduce permanent199     total disability benefits as provided in Subsection (6)(d) when reasonable, medically200     appropriate, part-time work is offered, but the employee fails to fully cooperate.201          (7)  When an employee is rehabilitated or the employee's rehabilitation is possible but202     the employee has some loss of bodily function, the award shall be for permanent partial203     disability.204          (8)  As determined by an administrative law judge, an employee is not entitled to205     disability compensation, unless the employee fully cooperates with any evaluation or206     reemployment plan under this chapter or Chapter 3, Utah Occupational Disease Act.  The207     administrative law judge shall dismiss without prejudice the claim for benefits of an employee208     if the administrative law judge finds that the employee fails to fully cooperate, unless the209     administrative law judge states specific findings on the record justifying dismissal with210     prejudice.211          (9) (a)  The loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of the following constitutes212     total and permanent disability that is compensated according to this section:213          (i)  both hands;214          (ii)  both arms;215          (iii)  both feet;216          (iv)  both legs;217          (v)  both eyes; or218          (vi)  any combination of two body members described in this Subsection (9)(a).219          (b)  A finding of permanent total disability pursuant to Subsection (9)(a) is final.220          (10) (a)  An insurer or self-insured employer may periodically reexamine a permanent221     total disability claim, except those based on Subsection (9), for which the insurer or222     self-insured employer had or has payment responsibility to determine whether the employee223     continues to have a permanent, total disability.224          (b)  Reexamination may be conducted no more than once every three years after an225     award is final, unless good cause is shown by the employer or [its] the employer's insurance226     carrier to allow more frequent reexaminations.227          (c)  The reexamination may include:228          (i)  the review of medical records;229          (ii)  employee submission to one or more reasonable medical evaluations;230          (iii)  employee submission to one or more reasonable rehabilitation evaluations and231     retraining efforts;232          (iv)  employee disclosure of Federal Income Tax Returns;233          (v)  employee certification of compliance with Section 34A-2-110; and234          (vi)  employee completion of one or more sworn affidavits or questionnaires approved235     by the division.236          (d)  The insurer or self-insured employer shall pay for the cost of a reexamination with237     appropriate employee reimbursement pursuant to rule for reasonable travel allowance and per238     diem as well as reasonable expert witness fees incurred by the employee in supporting the239     employee's claim for permanent total disability benefits at the time of reexamination.240          (e)  If an employee fails to fully cooperate in the reasonable reexamination of a241     permanent total disability finding, an administrative law judge may order the suspension of the242     employee's permanent total disability benefits until the employee cooperates with the243     reexamination.244          (f) (i)  If the reexamination of a permanent total disability finding reveals evidence that245     reasonably raises the issue of an employee's continued entitlement to permanent total disability246     compensation benefits, an insurer or self-insured employer may petition the Division of247     Adjudication for a rehearing on that issue.  The insurer or self-insured employer shall include248     with the petition, documentation supporting the insurer's or self-insured employer's belief that249     the employee no longer has a permanent, total disability.250          (ii)  If the petition under Subsection (10)(f)(i) demonstrates good cause, as determined251     by the Division of Adjudication, an administrative law judge shall adjudicate the issue at a252     hearing.253          (iii)  Evidence of an employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time work254     may not be the sole basis for termination of an employee's permanent total disability255     entitlement, but the evidence of the employee's participation in medically appropriate, part-time256     work under Subsection (6) may be considered in the reexamination or hearing with other257     evidence relating to the employee's status and condition.258          (g)  In accordance with Section 34A-1-309, the administrative law judge may award259     reasonable attorney fees to an attorney retained by an employee to represent the employee's260     interests with respect to reexamination of the permanent total disability finding, except if the261     employee does not prevail, the attorney fees shall be set at $1,000.  The attorney fees awarded262     shall be paid by the employer or [its] the employer's insurance carrier in addition to the263     permanent total disability compensation benefits due.264          (h)  During the period of reexamination or adjudication, if the employee fully265     cooperates, each insurer, self-insured employer, or the Employers' Reinsurance Fund shall266     continue to pay the permanent total disability compensation benefits due the employee.267          (11)  If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision to any person268     or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this section is given effect without the invalid269     provision or application.
