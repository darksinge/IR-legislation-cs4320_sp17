evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically or sexually abused.                                      a   i   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether                            reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the                            child s home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued                            removal.                                 ii   If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child s                            parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with                            the child s parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.                                 b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a , and in ordering and                            providing services, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in                            accordance with federal law.                                      Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency                            situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that                            any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                                      In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or                            neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                            efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home, return a child to                            the child s home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent                            or parents.                                      The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of                            educational neglect as described in Subsection         a            u  ii .                                      a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section, the                               court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.                                 b   If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home, the court shall                            state the facts on which that decision is based.                                      If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for                            the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if the child were returned home,                            the court shall order continued removal regardless of                                  a   any error in the initial removal of the child                                  b   the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions  or                                 c   any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child                            and Family Services.

With regard to a child in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services                            who is the subject of a petition alleging abuse, neglect, or dependency, and who has been                            placed in foster care with a foster family, the Legislature finds that                                  a   except with regard to the child s natural parents, a foster family has a very limited                            but recognized interest in its familial relationship with the child  and                                 b   children in the custody of the division are experiencing multiple changes in foster                            care placements with little or no documentation, and that numerous studies of child growth and                            development emphasize the importance of stability in foster care living arrangements.                                        For the reasons described in Subsection    , the Legislature finds that, except with                            regard to the child s natural parents, procedural due process protections must be provided to a                            foster family prior to removal of a foster child from  their  the foster home.                                     a   A foster parent who has had a foster child in  his custody  the foster parent s                           home for    months or longer may petition the juvenile court for a review and determination of                            the appropriateness of a decision by the Division of Child and Family Services to remove the                            child from the  child s  foster home, unless the removal was for the purpose of                                  i   returning the child to the child s natural parent or legal guardian                                  ii   immediately placing the child in an approved adoptive home                                  iii   placing the child with a relative, as defined in Subsection         a             d      b ,                            who obtained custody or asserted an interest in the child within the preference period described                             in Subsection         a                  a   or                                  iv   placing an Indian child in accordance with preplacement preferences and other                             requirements described in the Indian Child Welfare Act,    U.S.C. Sec.     .                                  b   The foster parent may petition the court under this section without exhausting                             administrative remedies within the division.                                  c   The court may order the division to place the child in a specified home, and shall                             base its determination on the best interest of the child.                                      The requirements of this section do not apply to the removal of a child based on a                             foster parent s request for that removal.                                 Section   .
