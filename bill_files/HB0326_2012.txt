    (ix)  Section 

76-5-203

, attempted murder; or
            
38

    
    (b)  an offense other than those listed in Subsection (1)(a) involving the use of a
            
39

    
dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and the minor has been
            
40

    
previously adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous weapon
            
41

    
which also would have been a felony if committed by an adult.
            
42

    
    (2)  All proceedings before the juvenile court related to charges filed under Subsection
            
43

    
(1) shall be conducted in conformity with the rules established by the Utah Supreme Court.
            
44

    
    (3) (a)  If the information alleges the violation of a felony listed in Subsection (1), the
            
45

    
state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish
            
46

    
probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection (1) has been committed
            
47

    
and that the defendant committed it.  If proceeding under Subsection (1)(b), the state shall have
            
48

    
the additional burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has
            
49

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
50

    
weapon.
            
51

    
    (b)  If the juvenile court judge finds the state has met its burden under this Subsection
            
52

    
(3), the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district
            
53

    
court in the same manner as an adult unless the juvenile court judge finds that all of the
            
54

    
following conditions exist:
            
55

    
    (i)  the minor has not been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense involving
            
56

    
the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult;
            
57

    
    (ii)  that if the offense was committed with one or more other persons, the minor
            
58

    
appears to have a lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants; and

            
59


    
    (iii)  that the minor's role in the offense was not committed in a violent, aggressive, or
            
60

    
premeditated manner.
            
61

    
    (c)  Once the state has met its burden under this Subsection (3) as to a showing of
            
62

    
probable cause, the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and presenting evidence
            
63

    
as to the existence of the above conditions.
            
64

    
    (d)  If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that all the above
            
65

    
conditions are satisfied, the court shall so state in its findings and order the minor held for trial
            
66

    
as a minor and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
67

    
    (4)  If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the
            
68

    
state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over
            
69

    
under Subsection (1), the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor
            
70

    
and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
71

    
    (5)  At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue. 
            
72

    
The defendant shall have the same right to bail as any other criminal defendant and shall be
            
73

    
advised of that right by the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court shall set initial bail in
            
74

    
accordance with Title 77, Chapter 20, Bail.
            
75

    
    (6)  If an indictment is returned by a grand jury charging a violation under this section,
            
76

    
the preliminary examination held by the juvenile court judge need not include a finding of
            
77

    
probable cause that the crime alleged in the indictment was committed and that the defendant
            
78

    
committed it, but the juvenile court shall proceed in accordance with this section regarding the
            
79

    
additional considerations listed in Subsection (3)(b).
            
80

    
    (7)  When a defendant is charged with multiple criminal offenses in the same
            
81

    
information or indictment and is bound over to answer in the district court for one or more
            
82

    
charges under this section, other offenses arising from the same criminal episode and any
            
83

    
subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against him shall be considered together with
            
84

    
those charges, and where the court finds probable cause to believe that those crimes have been
            
85

    
committed and that the defendant committed them, the defendant shall also be bound over to
            
86

    
the district court to answer for those charges.
            
87

    
    (8)  When a minor has been bound over to the district court under this section, the
            
88

    
jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Justice Services and the juvenile court over the minor is
            
89

    
terminated regarding that offense, any other offenses arising from the same criminal episode,

            
90


    
and any subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against the minor, except as provided in
            
91

    
Subsection (12).
            
92

    
    (9)  A minor who is bound over to answer as an adult in the district court under this
            
93

    
section or on whom an indictment has been returned by a grand jury is not entitled to a
            
94

    
preliminary examination in the district court.
            
95

    
    (10)  Allegations contained in the indictment or information that the defendant has
            
96

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
97

    
weapon, or is 16 years of age or older, are not elements of the criminal offense and do not need
            
98

    
to be proven at trial in the district court.
            
99

    
    (11)  If a minor enters a plea to, or is found guilty of, any of the charges filed or any
            
100

    
other offense arising from the same criminal episode, the district court retains jurisdiction over
            
101

    
the minor for all purposes, including sentencing.
            
102

    
    (12)  The juvenile court under Section 

78A-6-103

 and the Division of Juvenile Justice
            
103

    
Services regain jurisdiction and any authority previously exercised over the minor when there
            
104

    
is an acquittal, a finding of not guilty, or dismissal of all charges in the district court.
