When a governmental entity compiles a record in a form other than that normally                           maintained by the governmental entity, the actual costs under this section may include the                           following                                 a   the cost of staff time for summarizing, compiling, or tailoring the record either into an                           organization or media to meet the person s request                                 b   the cost of staff time for search, retrieval, and other direct administrative costs for                           complying with a request.

A governmental entity may require payment of past fees and future estimated fees                            before beginning to process a request if fees are expected to exceed    , or if the requester has not                            paid fees from previous requests.  Any prepaid amount in excess of fees due shall be returned to                            the requester.                                     This section does not alter, repeal, or reduce fees established by other statutes or                               legislative acts.                                      a   Notwithstanding Subsection     b , fees for voter registration records shall be set                           as provided in this Subsection     .                                 b   The lieutenant governor shall                                  i   after consultation with county clerks, establish uniform fees for voter registration and                           voter history records that meet the requirements of this section  and                                 ii   obtain legislative approval of those fees by following the procedures and requirements                           of Section            .     .
