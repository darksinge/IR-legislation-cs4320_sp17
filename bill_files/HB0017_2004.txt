 Legislative Review Note
    as of  10-29-03  3:07 PM

This bill has certain residency or in-state requirements.  These requirements might raise issues
under trade agreements and constitutional principles. These requirements might be challenged
as violating equal protection, substantive due process, or privileges and immunities because it
limits a person's ability to be a incorporator or director of the corporation based on residency. 
However, states may impose such requirements if the requirements are narrowly tailored to
further a substantial state interest.  These requirements might also be challenged under the
commerce clause because they favor in-state companies.  In this context, the state may impose
such restrictions if they further a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by
means less restrictive on out-of-state interests.
