Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM      The amendments in Subsection              of this bill address a constitutional conflict that  happened when the permanent state trust fund was approved by the voters in November      and  became law on January  ,     .  That new constitutional provision requires the income from the  state trust fund to be deposited into the state s General Fund.  The current statute retains fifty  percent of the interest and dividends in the state trust fund to be treated as principal.  The  amendments to Subsection              in this bill maintain the intent of the      Legislature to  retain fifty percent of the interest as principal, but does so by transferring it on an ongoing basis  from the General Fund to the permanent state trust fund.   Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel      Committee Note      The Health and Human Services Interim Committee recommended this bill.
