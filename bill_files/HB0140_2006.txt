 Legislative Review Note
    as of   1-18-06  10:34 AM

This legislation authorizes the Driver License Division to issue a temporary commercial driver
license to a person who is a not a resident that is domiciled in Utah.  This provision is in direct
contradiction to current federal CDL regulations, which require that a commercial driver
license must be issued by the applicant's state of domicile. 49 C.F.R. § 383.23. However, in a
letter from the director of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) dated
November 21, 2005, she indicated that the practice of issuing temporary commercial driver
licenses to out-of-state students at truck driving schools poses no threat to safety, that FMCSA
will hold off taking any action to withhold funding from a state due to noncompliance, and that
FMCSA will be initiating rulemaking to address the state of domicile requirement.
