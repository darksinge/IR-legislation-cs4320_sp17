Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
31

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
78A-6-701

 is amended to read:
            
32

    
     78A-6-701.  Jurisdiction of district court.
            
33

    
    (1)  The district court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all persons 16 years of age
            
34

    
or older charged with:
            
35

    
    (a)  an offense which would be murder or aggravated murder if committed by an adult;
            
36

    
or
            
37

    
    (b)  an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult if the minor has been
            
38

    
previously committed to a secure facility as defined in Section 

62A-7-101


.  This Subsection
            
39

    
(1)(b) shall not apply if the offense is committed in a secure facility.
            
40

    
    (2)  When the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction over a minor under this
            
41

    
section, it also has exclusive original jurisdiction over the minor regarding all offenses joined
            
42

    
with the qualifying offense, and any other offenses, including misdemeanors, arising from the
            
43

    
same criminal episode.  The district court is not divested of jurisdiction by virtue of the fact
            
44

    
that the minor is allowed to enter a plea to, or is found guilty of, a lesser or joined offense.
            
45

    
    (3) (a)  Any felony, misdemeanor, or infraction committed after the offense over which
            
46

47

    
defendant as an adult in the district court or justice court having jurisdiction.
            
48

    
    (b)  If the qualifying charge under Subsection (1) results in an acquittal, a finding of not
            
49

    
guilty, or a dismissal of the charge in the district court, the juvenile court under Section
            
50

    

78A-6-103


 and the Division of Juvenile Justice Services regain any jurisdiction and authority
            
51

    
previously exercised over the minor.
            
52

    
    (4)  A minor arrested under this section shall be held in a juvenile detention facility
            
53

    
until the district court determines where the minor shall be held until the time of trial, except
            
54

57

    
    (a)  the age of the minor;
            
58

    
    (b)  the nature, seriousness, and circumstances of the alleged offense;

            
59


    
    (c)  the minor's history of prior criminal acts;
            
60

    
    (d)  whether detention in a juvenile detention facility will adequately serve the need for
            
61

    
community protection pending the outcome of any criminal proceedings;
            
62

    
    (e)  whether the minor's placement in a juvenile detention facility will negatively impact
            
63

    
the functioning of the facility by compromising the goals of the facility to maintain a safe,
            
64

    
positive, and secure environment for all minors within the facility;
            
65

    
    (f)  the relative ability of the facility to meet the needs of the minor and protect the
            
66

    
public;
            
67

    
    (g)  whether the minor presents an imminent risk of harm to the minor or others within
            
68

    
the facility;
            
69

    
    (h)  the physical maturity of the minor;
            
70

    
    (i)  the current mental state of the minor as evidenced by relevant mental health or
            
71

    
psychological assessments or screenings that are made available to the court; and
            
72

    
    (j)  any other factors the court considers relevant.
            
73

    
    (6)  A minor ordered to a juvenile detention facility under Subsection (5) shall remain
            
74

    
in the facility until released by a district court judge, or if convicted, until sentencing.
            
75

    
    (7)  A minor held in a juvenile detention facility under this section shall have the same
            
76

    
right to bail as any other criminal defendant.

    (8)  If the minor ordered to a juvenile detention facility under Subsection (5) attains the
            
78

    
age of 18 years, the minor will be transferred within 30 days to an adult jail until released by
            
79

    
the district court judge, or if convicted, until sentencing.
            
80

    
    (9)  A minor 16 years of age or older whose conduct or condition endangers the safety
            
81

    
or welfare of others in the juvenile detention facility may, by court order that specifies the
            
82

    
reasons, be detained in another place of confinement considered appropriate by the court,
            
83

    
including jail or other place of pretrial confinement for adults.
            
84

87

    
a minor 16 years of age or older with a felony shall be by criminal information and filed in the

99

    
    (b)  an offense other than those listed in Subsection (1)(a) involving the use of a
            
100

    
dangerous weapon, which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and the minor has been
            
101

    
previously adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous weapon,
            
102

    
which also would have been a felony if committed by an adult.
            
103

    
    (2)  All proceedings before the juvenile court related to charges filed under Subsection
            
104

    
(1) shall be conducted in conformity with the rules established by the Utah Supreme Court.
            
105

    
    (3) (a)  If the information alleges the violation of a felony listed in Subsection (1), the
            
106

    
state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish
            
107

    
probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection (1) has been committed
            
108

    
and that the defendant committed it.  If proceeding under Subsection (1)(b), the state shall have
            
109

    
the additional burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has
            
110

    
previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous
            
111

    
weapon.
            
112

    
    (b)  If the juvenile court judge finds the state has met its burden under this Subsection
            
113

    
(3), the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district
            
114

    
court in the same manner as an adult unless the juvenile court judge finds that it would be
            
115

    
contrary to the best interest of the minor and to the public to bind over the defendant to the
            
116

    
jurisdiction of the district court.
            
117

    
    (c)  In making the bind over determination in Subsection (3)(b), the judge shall consider
            
118

    
only the following:
            
119

    
    (i)  whether the minor has been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense
            
120

    
involving the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult;

            
121


    
    (ii) if the offense was committed with one or more other persons, whether the minor
            
122

    
appears to have a greater or lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants;
            
123

    
    (iii) the extent to which the minor's role in the offense was committed in a violent,
            
124

    
aggressive, or premeditated manner;
            
125

    
    (iv)  the number and nature of the minor's prior adjudications in the juvenile court; and
            
126

    
    (v)  whether public safety is better served by adjudicating the minor in the juvenile
            
127

    
court or in the district court.
            
128

    
    (d)  Once the state has met its burden under Subsection (3)(a) as to a showing of
            
129

    
probable cause, the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and presenting evidence
            
130

    
that in light of the considerations listed in Subsection (3)(c), it would be contrary to the best
            
131

    
interest of the minor and the best interests of the public to bind the defendant over to the
            
132

    
jurisdiction of the district court.
            
133

    
    (e)  If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that it would be
            
134

    
contrary to the best interest of the minor and the best interests of the public to bind the
            
135

    
defendant over to the jurisdiction of the district court, the court shall so state in its findings and
            
136

    
order the minor held for trial as a minor and shall proceed upon the information as though it
            
137

    
were a juvenile petition.
            
138

    
    (4)  If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the
            
139

    
state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over
            
140

    
under Subsection (1), the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor
            
141

    
and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
            
142

    
    (5)  At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue. 
            
143

    
The defendant shall have the same right to bail as any other criminal defendant and shall be
            
144

    
advised of that right by the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court shall set initial bail in
            
145

    
accordance with Title 77, Chapter 20, Bail.
            
146

    
    (6)  At the time the minor is bound over to the district court, the juvenile court shall
            
147

    
make the initial determination on where the minor shall be held.
            
148

    
    (7)  The juvenile court shall consider the following when determining where the minor
            
149

    
shall be held until the time of trial:
            
150

    
    (a)  the age of the minor;
            
151

    
    (b)  the nature, seriousness, and circumstances of the alleged offense;

            
152


    
    (c)  the minor's history of prior criminal acts;
            
153

    
    (d)  whether detention in a juvenile detention facility will adequately serve the need for
            
154

    
community protection pending the outcome of any criminal proceedings;
            
155

    
    (e)  whether the minor's placement in a juvenile detention facility will negatively impact
            
156

    
the functioning of the facility by compromising the goals of the facility to maintain a safe,
            
157
