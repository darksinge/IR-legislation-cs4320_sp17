expert in family relations or who may conduct evaluations pursuant to this Subsection (2)[.];
            
61

76

    
    (c)  Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may waive the postplacement adoptive
            
77

78

    
postplacement evaluation.
            
79

    
    (5)  If the person or agency conducting the evaluation disapproves the adoptive
            
80

    
placement, either in the preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation, the court may
            
81

    
dismiss the petition. However, upon request of a prospective adoptive parent, the court shall
            
82

    
order that an additional preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation be conducted, and
            
83

    
hold a hearing on the suitability of the adoption, including testimony of interested parties.
            
84

    
    (6)  Prior to finalization of a petition for adoption the court shall review and consider
            
85

    
the information and recommendations contained in the preplacement and postplacement
            
86
