    (11)  The division or a designated mental retardation professional in charge of the
            
254

    
individual's care shall provide all documented information on the individual to be committed
            
255

    
and to the court at the time of the hearing.  The individual's attorney shall have access to all
            
256

    
documented information on the individual at the time of and prior to the hearing.
            
257

    
    (12) (a)  The court shall provide an opportunity to the individual, the petitioner, and all
            
258

    
other persons to whom notice is required to be given to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to

    (ii)  allow a waiver of the right to appear only for good cause shown;

    (c)  The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with
            
267

    
orderly procedure, and in a physical setting that is not likely to have a harmful effect on the
            
268

    
individual.  The Utah Rules of Evidence apply, and the hearing shall be a matter of court
            
269

    
record.  A verbatim record of the proceedings shall be maintained.
            
270

    
    (13)  The court may order commitment if, upon completion of the hearing and
            
271

    
consideration of the record, it finds by clear and convincing evidence that all of the following
            
272

    
conditions are met:
            
273

    
    (a)  the individual to be committed is mentally retarded;
            
274

    
    (b)  because of the individual's mental retardation one or more of the following
            
275

    
conditions exist:

            
276


    
    (i)  the individual poses an immediate danger of physical injury to self or others;
            
277

    
    (ii)  the individual lacks the capacity to provide the basic necessities of life, such as
            
278

    
food, clothing, or shelter; or
            
279

    
    (iii)  the individual is in immediate need of habilitation, rehabilitation, care, or
            
280

    
treatment to minimize the effects of the condition which poses a threat of serious physical or
            
281

    
psychological injury to the individual, and the individual lacks the capacity to engage in a
            
282

    
rational decision-making process concerning the need for habilitation, rehabilitation, care, or
            
283

    
treatment, as evidenced by an inability to weigh the possible costs and benefits of the care or
            
284

    
treatment and the alternatives to it;
            
285

    
    (c)  there is no appropriate, less restrictive alternative reasonably available; and
            
286

    
    (d)  the division or the mental retardation facility recommended by the division in
            
287

    
which the individual is to be committed can provide the individual with treatment, care,
            
288

    
habilitation, or rehabilitation that is adequate and appropriate to the individual's condition and
            
289

    
needs.
            
290

    
    (14)  In the absence of any of the required findings by the court, described in Subsection

292

    
    (15) (a)  The order of commitment shall designate the period for which the individual
            
293

    
will be committed.  An initial commitment may not exceed six months.  Before the end of the
            
294

    
initial commitment period, the administrator of the facility for persons with mental retardation
            
295

    
shall commence a review hearing on behalf of the individual.
            
296

297

    
commitment for up to a one-year period.

    (16)  An individual committed under this part has the right to a rehearing, upon filing a
            
299

    
petition with the court within 30 days after entry of the court's order.  If the petition for
            
300

    
rehearing alleges error or mistake in the court's findings, the court shall appoint one impartial
            
301

    
licensed physician and two impartial designated mental retardation professionals who have not
            
302

    
previously been involved in the case to examine the individual. The rehearing shall, in all other
            
303

    
respects, be conducted in accordance with this part.
            
304

    
    (17) (a)  The court shall maintain a current list of all individuals under its orders of
            
305

    
commitment.  That list shall be reviewed in order to determine those patients who have been
            
306

    
under an order of commitment for the designated period.

            
307


    
    (b)  At least two weeks prior to the expiration of the designated period of any
            
308

    
commitment order still in effect, the court that entered the original order shall inform the
            
309

    
director of the division of the impending expiration of the designated commitment period.
            
310

    
    (c)  The staff of the division shall immediately:

312

    
the results of the examination to the court;
            
313

    
    (ii)  discharge the resident from involuntary commitment if the conditions justifying
            
314

    
commitment no longer exist; and
            
315

    
    (iii)  immediately inform the court of any discharge.
            
316

    
    (d)  If the director of the division reports to the court that the conditions justifying
            
317

    
commitment no longer exist, and the administrator of the mental retardation facility does not
            
318

    
discharge the individual at the end of the designated period, the court shall order the immediate
            
319

    
discharge of the individual, unless involuntary commitment proceedings are again commenced
            
320

    
in accordance with this section.
            
321

    
    (e)  If the director of the division, or his designee reports to the court that the conditions
            
322

    
designated in Subsection (13) still exist, the court may extend the commitment order for up to
            
323

    
one year.  At the end of any extension, the individual must be reexamined in accordance with
            
324

    
this section, or discharged.
            
325

    
    (18)  When a resident is discharged under this subsection, the division shall provide any
            
326

    
further support services available and required to meet the resident's needs.

    (2)  Upon receipt of that petition, the court shall conduct proceedings under Section

62A-5-312

.  [If the petition is filed sooner than six months after the issuance of an order of
            
334

    
indeterminate involuntary commitment, the court may delay commencing proceedings until
            
335

    
that six-month period has ended, unless good cause for holding a hearing before the end of that
            
336

    
six-month period exists.]
            
337

    
    Section 8.

    (1)  The administrator of a mental retardation facility, or his designee, may transfer or
            
340

    
authorize the transfer of a resident to another mental retardation facility if, before the transfer,
            
341

    
the administrator conducts a careful evaluation of the resident and his treatment needs, and
            
342

    
determines that a transfer would be in the best interest of that resident.  If a resident is
            
343

    
transferred, the administrator shall give immediate notice of the transfer to the resident's
            
344

    
spouse, guardian, parent, [or advocate appointed under Section 

62A-5-303

    (2)  If a resident, or his parent or guardian, objects to a proposed transfer under this
            
347

349

    
make a recommendation to the administrator concerning the proposed transfer.  The transfer

decision on the proposed transfer.

    Section 9.   Repealer.
