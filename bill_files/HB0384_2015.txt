the maps referenced in Subsection (2) shall be available for488     inspection by the public at the offices of the Utah Association of Counties.489          (4)  The state finds with respect to the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) that:490          (a)  agricultural livestock industry on the lands comprising these zones has provided a491     significant contribution to the history, customs, culture, economy, welfare, and other values of492     each area for more than 100 years;493          (b)  the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exists within these zones494     if managed properly, that will support and expand continued, responsible agricultural livestock495     activities and wildlife habitat;496          (c)  agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources,497     human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural resources, landmarks,498     structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition,499     preservation, and protection;500          (d) (i)  the highest management priority for lands within these zones is the preservation,501     restoration, and enhancement of watershed and rangeland health to sustain and expand forage502     production for both livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, and the restoration and development503     of historic, existing, and future livestock grazing and wildlife habitat resources in order to504     provide protection for the resources, objects, customs, culture, and values identified above; and505          (ii)  notwithstanding Subsection (4)(d)(i), if part or all of any zone lies within a sage506     grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with507     the management priorities set forth in Subsection (4)(d)(i) to the maximum extent consistent508     with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area;509          (e)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any deposits of energy510     and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold,511     uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in512     these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these513     zones; and514          (f)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any recreation515     resources, including roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use, sightseeing,516     canyoneering, hunting, fishing, trapping, and hiking resources that may exist in these grazing517     zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these grazing518     zones.519          (5)  The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2) that the520     historic levels of livestock grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection (4) in each521     zone have greatly diminished, or are under other serious threat, due to:522          (a)  unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies,523     including:524          (i)  de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non-WSAs;525          (ii)  ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interior526     applicable to each of these zones; and527          (iii)  the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage;528          (b)  inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each year529     proven to be most effective for maintaining and enhancing rangeland conditions;530          (c)  mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage by531     excess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery counties;532          (d)  improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion, invasive533     species, and juniper, and other woody vegetation that:534          (i)  compromise watershed and rangeland health;535          (ii)  crowd out grazing forage;536          (iii)  degrade habitat and limit wildlife populations;537          (iv)  reduce water yield; and538          (v)  heighten the risk of catastrophic wildfire; and539          (e)  other practices that degrade overall rangeland health.540          (6)  To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection (5), the state541     supports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2):542          (a)  efficient and sustained policies, programs, and practices directed at preserving,543     restoring, and enhancing watershed and rangeland health to maximize:544          (i)  all permitted forage production for livestock grazing and other compatible uses,545     including flexible grazing on and off dates adaptive to yearly climate and range conditions; and546          (ii)  forage for fish and wildlife;547          (b)  a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and local548     government agencies to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development549     of:550          (i)  forage resources for grazing livestock and wildlife; and551          (ii)  other uses compatible with livestock grazing and wildlife utilization;552          (c)  effective and responsible management of wild horses and burros to eliminate excess553     populations; and554          (d)  effective and responsible management of wildlife habitat.555          (7)  The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within each556     grazing zone:557          (a)  fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties within558     which each grazing zone is situated to develop, amend, and implement land and resource559     management plans, and implement management decisions that are consistent with the560     purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under561     federal law;562          (b)  expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of grazing permits, range563     improvements, and applications to enhance and otherwise develop all existing and permitted564     grazing resources located within each grazing zone, including renewable vegetative resources;565          (c)  allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines,566     pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies567     described in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles;568          (d)  refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine,569     restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for each grazing zone as stated in this570     section;571          (e)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary572     to the goals and purposes described within this section; and573          (f)  refrain from implementing utilization standards less than 50%, unless:574          (i)  implementing a standard of less than 50% utilization on a temporary basis is575     necessary to resolve site-specific concerns; and576          (ii)  the federal agency consults, coordinates, and cooperates fully with local577     governments.578          (8) (a)  If a grazing zone described in Subsection (2) is managed or neglected in such a579     way as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a580     county or a county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk adversely affects the health,581     safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock582     grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that adverse effect:583          (i)  Subsections 11-51-103(1)(a) and (b) shall govern and apply to the chief executive584     officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in585     the grazing zone; and586          (ii)  Subsection 11-51-103(1)(b) shall govern and apply to the attorney general with587     respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone.588          (b)  If a grazing zone described in Subsection (2) is managed or neglected in such a way589     as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a county or a590     county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk constitutes an imminent threat to the591     health, safety and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock592     grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that imminent threat:593          (i)  Subsections 11-51-103(2) and (4) shall govern and apply to the chief executive594     officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in595     the grazing zone; and596          (ii)  Subsection 11-51-103(3) and Section 11-51-104 shall govern and apply to the597     attorney general with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing598     zone.599          [(8)] (9) (a)  The state recognizes the importance of all grazing districts on Utah BLM600     and Forest Service lands but establishes the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) to601     provide special protection and preservation against the identified threats found in Subsection602     (5) to exist in these zones.603          (b)  It is the intent of the state to designate additional grazing agricultural commodity604     zones in future years, if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation for new605     zones.606          [(9)] (10)  The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate607     with each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with608     membership consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state, and609     local governments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and610     management actions in zones described in Subsection (2) in order to achieve the goals,611     purposes, and policies described in this section.612          [(10)] (11)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and subject to Subsection613     (4)(d)(ii), the state's mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies and plans on land within the zones614     described in Subsection (2) shall be governed by Sections 63J-4-401 and 63J-8-104.615          Section 2.  Section 63J-8-105.9 is amended to read:616          63J-8-105.9.
