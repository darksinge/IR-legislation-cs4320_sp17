45

    
    (b)  An insurer that has paid the adoption indemnity benefit under Subsection (1)(a)
            
46

    
may seek reimbursement of the benefit if:
            
47

    
    (i)  the postplacement evaluation disapproves the adoption placement; and

59


    
    (ii)  makes a claim for the adoption indemnity benefit provided in Subsection (1)(a).
            
60

    
    (2)  If a policy offers optional maternity benefits, it shall also offer coverage for
            
61

    
adoption indemnity benefits if:
            
62

    
    (a)  a child is placed for adoption with the insured within 90 days of the child's birth;

66

    
receives services from a health care provider under contract with his insurer, the contracting
            
67

    
health care provider may only collect from the insured the amount that the contracting health
            
68

    
care provider is entitled to receive for such services under the contract, including any
            
69

    
applicable copayment.
