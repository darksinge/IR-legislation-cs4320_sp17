Legislature
                    It is the intent of the Legislature that the Airport to University of Utah
light rail line be built at an estimated cost of $480 million, with federal
appropriations pursuant to $640 million authorized in the Transportation
Equity Act of the 21st Century (Public Law 105-178).  It is further the intent of the Legislature that the Utah Transit Authority will commit its revenues
to offset operating costs associated with that line.  It is also the intent of the
Legislature that local governments within Salt Lake County



 pay the operating costs, such operating costs being covered by at least the Salt Lake
City portion of the 1/64th sales tax previously dedicated by Section 59-12-
103 of the Utah Code, which would exceed $10 million over the 12-year
period FY 2000-2011.   The balance of the local share would be dedicated
by capturing the enhanced local revenue generated by the construction of the
rail system, including increased sales and city property taxes, which is
estimated to be in excess of $15 million from the period 1999-2001.  This
revenue would be captured by creating a Special Transit District or other
appropriate means.   It is the intent of the Legislature that if these funds as
well as others, from these entities are insufficient, that by or during the 2001
Annual General Session, operating funds be provided by the Legislature
from state revenue and state authorizations for local revenues for operation
of the Airport to University of Utah light rail line in an amount not to
exceed $5 million per year for a maximum of ten years.
