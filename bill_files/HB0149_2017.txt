Jurisdiction of offenses.1127          (1)  A person is subject to prosecution in this state for an offense which he commits,1128     while either within or outside the state, by his own conduct or that of another for which he is1129     legally accountable, if:1130          (a)  the offense is committed either wholly or partly within the state;1131          (b)  the conduct outside the state constitutes an attempt to commit an offense within the1132     state;1133          (c)  the conduct outside the state constitutes a conspiracy to commit an offense within1134     the state and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs in the state; or1135          (d)  the conduct within the state constitutes an attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy to1136     commit in another jurisdiction an offense under the laws of both this state and the other1137     jurisdiction.1138          (2)  An offense is committed partly within this state if either the conduct which is any1139     element of the offense, or the result which is an element, occurs within this state.1140          (3)  In homicide offenses, the "result" is either the physical contact which causes death1141     or the death itself.1142          (a)  If the body of a homicide victim is found within the state, the death shall be1143     presumed to have occurred within the state.1144          (b)  If jurisdiction is based on this presumption, this state retains jurisdiction unless the1145     defendant proves by clear and convincing evidence that:1146          (i)  the result of the homicide did not occur in this state; and1147          (ii)  the defendant did not engage in any conduct in this state which is any element of1148     the offense.1149          (4) (a)  An offense which is based on an omission to perform a duty imposed by the law1150     of this state is committed within the state regardless of the location of the offender at the time1151     of the omission.1152          (b)  For the purpose of establishing venue for a violation of Subsection 77-41-105(3)1153     concerning [sex] offender registration, the offense is considered to be committed:1154          (i)  at the most recent registered primary residence of the offender, if the actual location1155     of the offender at the time of the violation is not known; or1156          (ii)  at the location of the offender at the time the offender is apprehended.1157          (5) (a)  If no jurisdictional issue is raised, the pleadings are sufficient to establish1158     jurisdiction.1159          (b)  The defendant may challenge jurisdiction by filing a motion before trial stating1160     which facts exist that deprive the state of jurisdiction.1161          (c)  The burden is upon the state to initially establish jurisdiction over the offense by a1162     preponderance of the evidence by showing under the provisions of Subsections (1) through (4)1163     that the offense was committed either wholly or partly within the borders of the state.1164          (d)  If after the prosecution has met its burden of proof under Subsection (5)(c) the1165     defendant claims that the state is deprived of jurisdiction or may not exercise jurisdiction, the1166     burden is upon the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence:1167          (i)  any facts claimed; and1168          (ii)  why those facts deprive the state of jurisdiction.1169          (6)  Facts that deprive the state of jurisdiction or prohibit the state from exercising1170     jurisdiction include the fact that the:1171          (a)  defendant is serving in a position that is entitled to diplomatic immunity from1172     prosecution and that the defendant's country has not waived that diplomatic immunity;1173          (b)  defendant is a member of the armed forces of another country and that the crime1174     that he is alleged to have committed is one that due to an international agreement, such as a1175     status of forces agreement between his country and the United States, cedes the exercise of1176     jurisdiction over him for that offense to his country;1177          (c)  defendant is an enrolled member of an Indian tribe, as defined in Section 9-9-101,1178     and that the Indian tribe has a legal status with the United States or the state that vests1179     jurisdiction in either tribal or federal courts for certain offenses committed within the exterior1180     boundaries of a tribal reservation, and that the facts establish that the crime is one that vests1181     jurisdiction in tribal or federal court; or1182          (d)  offense occurred on land that is exclusively within federal jurisdiction.1183          (7) (a)  The Legislature finds that identity fraud under Chapter 6, Part 11, Identity Fraud1184     Act, involves the use of personal identifying information which is uniquely personal to the1185     consumer or business victim of that identity fraud and which information is considered to be in1186     lawful possession of the consumer or business victim wherever the consumer or business1187     victim currently resides or is found.1188          (b)  For purposes of Subsection (1)(a), an offense which is based on a violation of1189     Chapter 6, Part 11, Identity Fraud Act, is committed partly within this state, regardless of the1190     location of the offender at the time of the offense, if the victim of the identity fraud resides or is1191     found in this state.1192          (8)  The judge shall determine jurisdiction.1193          Section 15.  Section 76-1-202 is amended to read:1194          76-1-202. Venue of actions.1195          (1)  Criminal actions shall be tried in the county, district, or precinct where the offense1196     is alleged to have been committed.  In determining the proper place of trial, the following1197     provisions shall apply:1198          (a)  If the commission of an offense commenced outside the state is consummated1199     within this state, the offender shall be tried in the county where the offense is consummated.1200          (b)  When conduct constituting elements of an offense or results that constitute1201     elements, whether the conduct or result constituting elements is in itself unlawful, shall occur1202     in two or more counties, trial of the offense may be held in any of the counties concerned.1203          (c)  If a person committing an offense upon the person of another is located in one1204     county and his victim is located in another county at the time of the commission of the offense,1205     trial may be held in either county.1206          (d)  If a cause of death is inflicted in one county and death ensues in another county, the1207     offender may be tried in either county.1208          (e)  A person who commits an inchoate offense may be tried in any county in which any1209     act that is an element of the offense, including the agreement in conspiracy, is committed.1210          (f)  Where a person in one county solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid another1211     in the planning or commission of an offense in another county, he may be tried for the offense1212     in either county.1213          (g)  When an offense is committed within this state and it cannot be readily determined1214     in which county or district the offense occurred, the following provisions shall be applicable:1215          (i)  When an offense is committed upon any railroad car, vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft1216     passing within this state, the offender may be tried in any county through which such railroad1217     car, vehicle, watercraft, or aircraft has passed.1218          (ii)  When an offense is committed on any body of water bordering on or within this1219     state, the offender may be tried in any county adjacent to such body of water.  The words "body1220     of water" shall include but not be limited to any stream, river, lake, or reservoir, whether1221     natural or man-made.1222          (iii)  A person who commits theft may be tried in any county in which he exerts control1223     over the property affected.1224          (iv)  If an offense is committed on or near the boundary of two or more counties, trial of1225     the offense may be held in any of such counties.1226          (v)  For any other offense, trial may be held in the county in which the defendant1227     resides, or, if he has no fixed residence, in the county in which he is apprehended or to which1228     he is extradited.1229          (h)  A person who commits an offense based on Chapter 6, Part 11, Identity Fraud Act,1230     may be tried in the county:1231          (i)  where the victim's personal identifying information was obtained;1232          (ii)  where the defendant used or attempted to use the personally identifying1233     information;1234          (iii)  where the victim of the identity fraud resides or is found; or1235          (iv)  if multiple offenses of identity fraud occur in multiple jurisdictions, in any county1236     where the victim's identity was used or obtained, or where the victim resides or is found.1237          (i)  For the purpose of establishing venue for a violation of Subsection 77-41-105(3)1238     concerning [sex] offender registration, the offense is considered to be committed:1239          (i)  at the most recent registered primary residence of the offender, if the actual location1240     of the offender at the time of the violation is not known; or1241          (ii)  at the location of the offender at the time the offender is apprehended.1242          (2)  All objections of improper place of trial are waived by a defendant unless made1243     before trial.1244          Section 16.  Section 76-3-402 is amended to read:1245          76-3-402. Conviction of lower degree of offense -- Procedure and limitations.1246          (1)  If at the time of sentencing the court, having regard to the nature and circumstances1247     of the offense of which the defendant was found guilty and to the history and character of the1248     defendant, and after having given any victims present at the sentencing and the prosecuting1249     attorney an opportunity to be heard, concludes it would be unduly harsh to record the1250     conviction as being for that degree of offense established by statute, the court may enter a1251     judgment of conviction for the next lower degree of offense and impose sentence accordingly.1252          (2)  If the court suspends the execution of the sentence and places the defendant on1253     probation, whether or not the defendant is committed to jail as a condition of probation, the1254     court may enter a judgment of conviction for the next lower degree of offense:1255          (a)  after the defendant has been successfully discharged from probation;1256          (b)  upon motion and notice to the prosecuting attorney;1257          (c)  after reasonable effort has been made by the prosecuting attorney to provide notice1258     to any victims;1259          (d)  after a hearing if requested by either party under Subsection (2)(c); and1260          (e)  if the court finds entering a judgment of conviction for the next lower degree of1261     offense is in the interest of justice.1262          (3) (a)  An offense may be reduced only one degree under this section, whether the1263     reduction is entered under Subsection (1) or (2), unless the prosecutor specifically agrees in1264     writing or on the court record that the offense may be reduced two degrees.1265          (b)  In no case may an offense be reduced under this section by more than two degrees.1266          (4)  This section does not preclude any person from obtaining or being granted an1267     expungement of his record as provided by law.1268          (5)  The court may not enter judgment for a conviction for a lower degree of offense if:1269          (a)  the reduction is specifically precluded by law; or1270          (b)  if any unpaid balance remains on court ordered restitution for the offense for which1271     the reduction is sought.1272          (6)  When the court enters judgment for a lower degree of offense under this section,1273     the actual title of the offense for which the reduction is made may not be altered.1274          (7) (a)  A person may not obtain a reduction under this section of a conviction that1275     requires the person to register as [a sex] an offender until the registration requirements under1276     Title 77, Chapter 41, Sex [and], Kidnap, and Child Abuse Offender Registry, have expired.1277          (b)  A person required to register as [a sex] an offender for the person's lifetime under1278     Subsection 77-41-105(3)(c) may not be granted a reduction of the conviction for the offense or1279     offenses that require the person to register as [a sex] an offender.1280          (8)  As used in this section, "next lower degree of offense" includes an offense1281     regarding which:1282          (a)  a statutory enhancement is charged in the information or indictment that would1283     increase either the maximum or the minimum sentence; and1284          (b)  the court removes the statutory enhancement pursuant to this section.1285          Section 17.
