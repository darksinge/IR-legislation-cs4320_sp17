                before establishing or modifying any impact fee.                                b   A local political subdivision may not                                 i   establish any new impact fees that are not authorized by this chapter  or                                ii   impose or charge any  other fees as a condition of development approval unless those                           fees are a reasonable charge for the service provided.                                c   Notwithstanding any other requirements of this chapter, each local political subdivision                           shall ensure that each existing impact fee that is charged for any public facility not authorized by                           Subsection                       is repealed by July  ,     .                                d   i   Existing impact fees for public facilities authorized in Subsection                                                 that are charged by local political subdivisions need not comply with the requirements of this                           chapter until July  ,     .                                   ii   By July  ,     , each local political subdivision shall                                 A   review any impact fees in existence as of the effective date of this act, and prepare and                           approve the analysis required by this section for each of those impact fees  and                                B   ensure that the impact fees comply with the requirements of this chapter.                                    a   Before imposing impact fees, each local political subdivision shall prepare a capital                           facilities plan.                                b   The plan shall  identify                                  i   include an inventory of all existing public facilities                                  i    ii   identify demands placed upon existing public facilities by new development                           activity   and                                  ii    iii   identify the proposed means by which the local political subdivision will meet                           those demands  and                                iv   include a detailed estimate of the capital costs for any proposed system improvements.                                c   Municipalities and counties need not prepare a separate capital facilities plan if the                           general plan required by Sections                  and                   contains the elements required by this                           subsection.                                d   i   If a local political subdivision prepares an independent capital facilities plan rather                           than including a capital facilities element in the general plan, the local political subdivision                           shall ,                                  A   before adopting the capital facilities plan, give public notice of the plan according to                           this  subsection, make a copy of the plan available to the public  Subsection     d                                  B   at least    days before the date of the public hearing ,                                  I   make a copy of the plan, together with a summary easily understood by the general                          public, available to the public at no cost  and                                II   place a copy of the plan and summary in each public library within the local political                          subdivision  and                                C   hold a public hearing to hear public comment on the plan.                                ii   Municipalities shall comply with the notice and hearing requirements of, and receive                           the protections of, Subsections                     and                    .                                iii   Counties shall comply with the notice and hearing requirements of, and receive the                           protections of, Subsections                      and                     .                                   iv   Special districts shall comply with the notice and hearing requirements of, and receive                           the protections of, Section       A          .                                v   Nothing contained in Subsection     d  or in the subsections referenced in Subsections                              d  ii  and  iii  may be construed to require involvement by a planning commission in the                           capital facilities planning process.                                e   Local political subdivisions with a population or serving a population of less than                                as of the last federal census need not comply with the capital facilities plan requirements of this                           part, but shall ensure that the impact fees imposed by them are based upon a reasonable plan.                                    In preparing the plan, each local political subdivision shall  generally                                  a   consider all revenue sources, including impact fees, to finance the impacts on system                           improvements  and                                b   specifically explain the effect that other revenue sources would have on the average                          household if the other revenue sources were used instead of impact fees.                                    A local political subdivision may only impose impact fees on development activities                            when its plan for financing system improvements establishes that impact fees are necessary to                           achieve an equitable allocation to the costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in                           comparison to the benefits already received and yet to be received.                                    a   Each local political subdivision imposing impact fees shall prepare a written                           analysis of each impact fee that                                 i   identifies the impact on system improvements required by the development activity                                 ii   demonstrates how those impacts on system improvements are reasonably related to the                           development activity                                 iii   estimates the  proportionate share of the costs of impacts on system improvements                            that are reasonably related to the new development activity  and                                iv   based upon those factors and the requirements of this chapter, identifies how the                           impact fee was calculated.                                b   In establishing that impact fees are necessary to achieve an equitable allocation to the                          costs borne in the past and to be borne in the future, in comparison to the benefits already received                          and yet to be received, and in analyzing whether or not the proportionate share of the costs of                           public facilities are reasonably related to the new development activity, the local political                           subdivision shall identify , if applicable                                     i   the original cost of all existing public facilities                                 ii   the manner of financing existing public facilities, such as user charges, special                           assessments, bonded indebtedness, general taxes, or federal grants                                 iii   the relative extent to which the newly developed properties and the other properties                           in the municipality have already contributed to the cost of existing public facilities, by such means                           as user charges, special assessments, or payment from the proceeds of general taxes                                 iv   the relative extent to which the newly developed properties and the other properties                           in the municipality will contribute to the cost of existing public facilities in the future                                 v   the extent to which the newly developed properties are entitled to a credit because the                           municipality is requiring their developers or owners, by contractual arrangement or otherwise, to                            provide common facilities, inside or outside the proposed development, that have been provided                            by the municipality and financed through general taxation or other means, apart from user charges,                            in other parts of the municipality                                  vi   extraordinary costs, if any, in servicing the newly developed properties  and                                 vii   the time price differential inherent in fair comparisons of amounts paid at different                            times.                                 c   In identifying the items in Subsection     b , each local political subdivision shall, in                           its written analysis, explain in detail the information on which the local political subdivision bases                           its determination of the equitable allocation of the costs borne by existing and new development                           in comparison to the benefits already received and yet to be received by both.                                 d   A local political subdivision may not adopt an impact fee enactment if any of the items                           in Subsection     b  is not expressly identified or if the explanation required under Subsection                               c  is not provided for any of those items.                                 e   A local political subdivision may not prepare, consider, or adopt a written analysis                           required under this Subsection     until    days after adoption of a capital facilities plan.                                 f   i   Before adopting a written analysis under this Subsection    , each local political                           subdivision shall                                  A   give public notice of the written analysis according to this Subsection     f                                   B   at least    days before the date of the public hearing                                  I   make a copy of the written analysis, with a summary easily understood by the general                           public, available to the public at no cost  and                                    II   place a copy of the written analysis and summary in each public library within the local                           political subdivision  and                                 C   hold a public hearing to obtain public comment on the analysis.                                 ii   Each municipality shall comply with the notice and hearing requirements and receive                           the protections of Subsections                     and                    .                                 iii   Each county shall comply with the notice and hearing requirements and receive the                           protections of Subsections                      and                     .                                 iv   Each special district shall comply with the notice and hearing requirements and                           receive the protections of Section       A          .
