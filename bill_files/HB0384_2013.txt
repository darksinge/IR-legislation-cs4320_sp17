be made by personal service or certified mail, the court may then allow service by electronic
            
495

    
publication on Utah's Public Legal Notice Website established in Subsection 

45-1-101

    (b)  The answer shall be filed within 30 days after the complaint is served upon the

513

    
    (7)  A claimant may file an answer to a complaint for civil forfeiture without posting

515

    
    Section 16.  
Section  
24-4-105

 is enacted to read:
            
516

    
     24-4-105.  Criminal forfeiture procedure.
            
517

    
    (1)  If a claimant is criminally prosecuted for conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, the
            
518

    
prosecuting attorney may elect to seek forfeiture of the claimant's interest in the property
            
519

    
through the criminal case.
            
520

    
    (2)  If the prosecuting attorney elects to seek forfeiture of the claimant's interest in the
            
521

    
property through the criminal case, the information or indictment shall state that the claimant's
            
522

    
interest in the property is subject to forfeiture and the basis for the forfeiture.
            
523

    
    (3) (a)  Upon application of the prosecuting attorney, the court may enter restraining

            
524


    
orders or injunctions, or take other reasonable actions to preserve for forfeiture under this
            
525

    
section, any property subject to forfeiture if, after notice to known claimants and claimants who
            
526

    
can be identified after due diligence and who are known to have an interest in the property, and
            
527

    
after affording those persons an opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that:
            
528

    
    (i)  there is a substantial probability that the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture
            
529

    
and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being sold, transferred, destroyed,
            
530

    
or removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and
            
531

    
    (ii)  the need to preserve the availability of the property or prevent its sale, transfer,
            
532

    
destruction, or removal through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship against
            
533

    
any party against whom the order is to be entered.
            
534

    
    (b)  A temporary restraining order may be entered ex parte upon application of the
            
535

    
prosecuting attorney before or after an information or indictment has been filed with respect to
            
536

    
the property, if the prosecuting attorney demonstrates that:
            
537

    
    (i)  there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is
            
538

    
sought would, in the event of a conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section; and
            
539

    
    (ii)  provision of notice would jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture
            
540

    
or would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.
            
541

    
    (c)  The temporary order expires not more than 10 days after entry unless extended for
            
542

    
good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension.
            
543

    
    (d)  After service of the temporary order upon any claimants known to the prosecuting
            
544

    
attorney, a hearing concerning the order entered under this section shall be held as soon as
            
545

    
practicable and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.
            
546

    
    (e)  The court is not bound by the Utah Rules of Evidence regarding evidence it may
            
547

    
receive and consider at any hearing under this section.
            
548

    
    (4) (a)  Upon conviction of a claimant for conduct giving rise to criminal forfeiture, the
            
549

    
prosecutor shall ask the finder of fact to make a specific finding as to whether the property or
            
550

    
any part of it is subject to forfeiture.
            
551

    
    (b)  A determination of whether property is subject to forfeiture under this section shall
            
552

    
be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
            
553

    
    (5) (a)  Upon conviction of a claimant for violating any provision of state law
            
554

    
subjecting a claimant's property to forfeiture and a finding by the trier of fact that the property

            
555


    
is subject to forfeiture, the court shall enter a judgment and order the property forfeited to the
            
556

    
state upon the terms stated by the court in its order.
            
557

    
    (b)  Following the entry of an order declaring property forfeited, the court may, upon
            
558

    
application of the prosecuting attorney, enter appropriate restraining orders or injunctions,
            
559

    
require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators,
            
560

    
appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the state in
            
561

    
property ordered forfeited.
            
562

    
    (6) (a) (i)  After property is ordered forfeited under this section, the seizing agency shall
            
563

    
direct the disposition of the property under Section 

24-4-115

.
            
564

    
    (ii)  Any property right or interest under this Subsection (6)(a) not exercisable by or
            
565

    
transferable for value to the state expires and does not revert to the defendant.
            
566

    
    (iii)  The defendant or any person acting in concert with or on behalf of the defendant is
            
567

    
not eligible to purchase forfeited property at any sale held by the seizing agency unless
            
568

    
approved by the judge.
            
569

    
    (b)  The court may stay the sale or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of
            
570

    
any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture if the defendant demonstrates that
            
571

    
proceeding with the sale or disposition of the property may result in irreparable injury, harm, or
            
572

    
loss.
            
573

    
    (7)  Except as provided under Subsection (3) or (10), a party claiming an interest in
            
574

    
property subject to forfeiture under this section:
            
575

    
    (a)  may not intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving the forfeiture of
            
576

    
property under this section; and
            
577

    
    (b)  may not commence an action at law or equity concerning the validity of the party's
            
578

    
alleged interests in the property subsequent to the filing of an indictment or an information
            
579

    
alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this section.
            
580

    
    (8)  The district court that has jurisdiction of a case under this part may enter orders
            
581

    
under this section without regard to the location of any property that may be subject to
            
582

    
forfeiture under this section or that has been ordered forfeited under this section.
            
583

    
    (9)  To facilitate the identification or location of property declared forfeited and to
            
584

    
facilitate the disposition of petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture after the entry of
            
585

    
an order declaring property forfeited to the state, the court may, upon application of the

            
586


    
prosecuting attorney, order that the testimony of any witness relating to the forfeited property
            
587

    
be taken by deposition, and that any book, paper, document, record, recording, or other
            
588

    
material shall be produced as provided for depositions and discovery under the Utah Rules of
            
589

    
Civil Procedure.
            
590

    
    (10) (a) (i)  Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the
            
591

    
prosecuting attorney shall publish notice of the order's intent to dispose of the property by
            
592

    
electronic publication on Utah's Public Legal Notice Website established in Subsection

45-1-101

(2)(b).
            
594

    
    (ii)  The prosecuting attorney shall also send written notice to any claimants, other than
            
595

    
the defendant, known to the prosecuting attorney to have an interest in the property, at the
            
596

    
claimant's last known address.
            
597

    
    (b) (i)  Any claimant, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property that
            
598

    
has been ordered forfeited to the state under this section may, within 30 days after the notice
            
599

    
has been published or the claimant receives the written notice under Subsection (10)(a),
            
600

    
whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of the claimant's
            
601

    
alleged interest in the property.
            
602

    
    (ii)  Any genuine issue of material fact, including issues of standing, may be tried to a
            
603

    
jury upon demand of any party.
            
604

    
    (c)  The petition shall:
            
605

    
    (i)  be in writing and signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury;
            
606

    
    (ii)  set forth the nature and extent of the claimant's right, title, or interest in the
            
607

    
property, the time and circumstances of the claimant's acquisition of the right, title, or interest
            
608

    
in the property; and
            
609

    
    (iii)  set forth any additional facts supporting the claimant's claim and the relief sought.
            
610

    
    (d)  The trial or hearing on the petition shall be expedited to the extent practicable.  The
            
611

    
court may consolidate a trial or hearing on the petition and any petition filed by any claimant
            
612

    
other than the defendant under this section.  The court shall permit the parties to conduct
            
613

    
pretrial discovery pursuant to the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.
            
614

    
    (e) (i)  At the trial or hearing, the claimant may testify and present evidence and
            
615

    
witnesses on the claimant's own behalf and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing. 
            
616

    
The prosecuting attorney may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of the

            
617


    
claim to the property and cross-examine witnesses who appear.
            
618

    
    (ii)  In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the trial or hearing, the court
            
619

    
may consider the relevant portion of the record of the criminal case that resulted in the order of
            
620

    
forfeiture.
            
621

    
    (iii)  Any trial or hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the Utah Rules of Evidence.
            
622

    
    (f)  The court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination, if
            
623

    
after the trial or hearing, the court or jury determines that the petitioner has established by a
            
624

    
preponderance of the evidence that:
            
625

    
    (i)  the claimant has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and the right, title, or
            
626

    
interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or
            
627

    
interest was vested in the claimant rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title,
            
628

    
or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts or conduct that gave rise
            
629

    
to the forfeiture of the property under this section; or
            
630

    
    (ii)  the claimant acquired the right, title, or interest in the property in a bona fide
            
631

    
transaction for value, and, at the time of acquisition, the claimant did not know that the
            
632

    
property was subject to forfeiture.
            
633

    
    (g)  Following the court's disposition of all petitions filed under this Subsection (10), or
            
634

    
if no petitions are filed following the expiration of the period provided in Subsection (10)(b)
            
635

    
for the filing of petitions, the state has clear title to property subject to the order of forfeiture
            
636

    
and may warrant good title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee.
            
637

24-4-106

 is enacted to read:

     24-4-107.  Innocent owners.
            
642

    
    (1)  An innocent owner's interest in property may not be forfeited.
            
643

    
    (2)  In a forfeiture proceeding under this chapter, the prosecuting attorney has the
            
644

    
burden of establishing evidence that a claimant:
            
645

    
    (a)  is responsible for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, subject to Subsection (4);
            
646

    
    (b)  knew of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, and allowed the property to be
            
647

    
used in furtherance of the conduct;

            
648


    
    (c)  acquired the property with notice of its actual or constructive seizure for forfeiture
            
649

    
under this chapter;
            
650

    
    (d)  acquired the property knowing the property was subject to forfeiture under this
            
651

    
chapter; or
            
652

    
    (e)  acquired the property in an effort to conceal, prevent, hinder, or delay its lawful
            
653

    
seizure or forfeiture under any provision of state law.
            
654

    
    (3) (a)  A claimant under this chapter is not required to take steps to prevent illegal use
            
655

    
or criminal activity regarding the property that the claimant reasonably believes would be likely
            
656

    
to result in physical harm or danger to any person.
            
657

    
    (b)  A claimant may demonstrate that the claimant took reasonable action to prohibit the
            
658

    
illegal use of the property by:
            
659

    
    (i)  making a timely notification to a law enforcement agency of information that led the
            
660

    
claimant to know that conduct subjecting the property to seizure would occur, was occurring,
            
661

    
or has occurred;
            
662

    
    (ii)  timely revoking or attempting to revoke permission to use the property regarding
            
663

    
those engaging in the illegal conduct; or
            
664

    
    (iii)  taking reasonable actions to discourage or prevent the illegal use of the property.
            
665

    
    (4)  If the state relies on Subsection (2)(a) to establish that a claimant is not an innocent
            
666

    
owner, and if the claimant is criminally charged with the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture
            
667

    
and is acquitted of that charge on the merits:
            
668

    
    (a)  the property subject to the forfeiture or the open market value of the property, if the
            
669

    
property has been disposed of under Subsection 

24-4-108

(13), shall be returned to the
            
670

    
claimant; and
            
671

    
    (b)  any payments required under this chapter regarding holding the property shall be
            
672

    
paid to the claimant.
            
673

    
    (5)  A person may not assert under this chapter an ownership interest in contraband.
            
674

    
    (6)  Property is presumed to be subject to forfeiture under this chapter if the prosecuting
            
675

    
attorney establishes that:
            
676

    
    (a)  the claimant has engaged in conduct giving cause for forfeiture;
            
677

    
    (b)  the property was acquired by the claimant during that period of the conduct giving
            
678

    
cause for forfeiture or within a reasonable time after that period; and

            
679


    
    (c)  there was no likely source for the purchase or acquisition of the property other than
            
680

    
the conduct giving cause for forfeiture.
            
681

    
    (7)  A finding that property is the proceeds of conduct giving cause for forfeiture does
            
682

    
not require proof that the property was the proceeds of any particular exchange or transaction.
            
683

    
    Section 19.  
Section  
24-4-108

684

    
     24-4-108.  Release of property held for forfeiture on certain grounds.

    (1)  After the seizing agency gives notice that the property is to be held for forfeiture, a
            
686

    
person or entity may not alienate, convey, sequester, or attach that property until the court
            
687

    
issues a final order of dismissal or an order of forfeiture regarding the property.
            
688

    
    (2)  The seizing agency or the prosecuting attorney may authorize the release of

    (3)  With the consent of a court of competent jurisdiction, the prosecuting attorney may
            
691

forfeiture proceedings; and
            
697

    
    (b)  the acts of the agency that possesses the property or the prosecuting attorney

property as determined by the court or by the parties' stipulation.
            
702

    
    (b)  The district court may refuse to order the release of the property if:
            
703

    
    (i)  the bond tendered is inadequate;

    (ii)  the property is contraband or is retained as evidence; or
            
705

    
    (iii)  the property is particularly altered or designed for use in conduct giving cause for
            
706

    
forfeiture.
            
707

708

    
subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the forfeiture of the surety bond or cash in lieu of the
            
709

    
property.

            
710


    
    (6)  A claimant is entitled to the immediate release of property held for forfeiture
            
711

    
pending the final determination of forfeiture if:
            
712

    
    (a)  the claimant had a possessory interest in the property at the time of seizure;
            
713

    
    (b)  continued possession by the agency or the state pending the final disposition of the
            
714

    
forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as:
            
715

    
    (i)  preventing the functioning of a legitimate business;
            
716

    
    (ii)  preventing any individual from working;

    (vi)  leaving any individual homeless; or
            
721

    
    (vii)  any other condition that the court determines causes a substantial hardship;
            
722

    
    (c)  the hardship from the continued possession of the property by the agency outweighs
            
723

    
the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is
            
724

    
returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding; and
            
725

    
    (d)  determination of substantial hardship under this Subsection (6) is based upon the
            
726

    
property's use prior to the seizure.
            
727

    
    (7)  After the seizing agency gives notice that the property is to be held for forfeiture, a
            
728

    
claimant may file a motion for hardship release:
            
729

    
    (a)  in the court in which forfeiture proceedings have commenced; or

    (b)  in any district court having jurisdiction over the property, if forfeiture proceedings
            
731

    
have not yet commenced.
            
732

    
    (8)  The motion for hardship release shall also be served upon the prosecuting attorney

734

    
    (9)  The court shall render a decision on a motion for hardship filed under this section
            
735

736

    
attorney or seizing agency, whichever is earlier, unless this period is extended by the agreement
            
737

    
of both parties or by the court for good cause shown.
            
738

    
    (10) (a)  If the claimant demonstrates substantial hardship pursuant to this section, the
            
739

    
court shall order the property immediately released to the claimant pending completion of
            
740

    
proceedings by the government to obtain forfeiture of the property.

            
741


    
    (b)  The court may place conditions on release of the property as it finds necessary and
            
742

    
appropriate to preserve the availability of the property or its equivalent for forfeiture.
            
743

    
    (11)  The hardship release under this section does not apply to:
            
744

    (b)  currency or other monetary instrument or electronic funds; or
            
746

claimant.
            
748

    
    (12) (a)  The court may order property that is held for forfeiture to be sold, as allowed
            
749

    
by Subsection (13), leased, rented, or operated to satisfy a specified interest of any claimant, or
            
750

    
to preserve the interests of any party on motion of that party.
            
751

    
    (b)  The court may enter orders under Subsection (12)(a) after written notice to persons

known to have an interest in the property, and after an opportunity for a hearing.
            
753

    
    (13) (a)  A sale may be ordered under Subsection (12) when the property is liable to
            
754

    
perish, waste, or be significantly reduced in value, or when the expenses of maintaining the
            
755

    
property are disproportionate to its value.
            
756

    
    (b)  A third party designated by the court shall dispose of the property by commercially
            
757

    
reasonable public sale and distribute the proceeds in the following order of priority:

761

795

    
    (1) (a)  A claimant's interest in property that is used to facilitate a crime, excluding
            
796

    
contraband, is not subject to forfeiture under any provision of state law if the forfeiture is
            
797

    
substantially disproportionate to the use of the property in committing or facilitating a violation
            
798

    
of state law and the value of the property.
            
799

    
    (b)  Forfeiture of property used solely in a manner that is merely incidental and not
            
800

    
instrumental to the commission or facilitation of a violation of law is not proportional.
            
801

    
    (2) (a)  In determining proportionality, the court shall consider:

    (i)  the conduct giving cause for the forfeiture;

            
803

805

    
offense; and
            
806

    
    (iv)  the value of the property.
            
807

    
    (b)  If the court finds that the forfeiture is substantially disproportional to the conduct
            
808

    
for which the claimant is responsible, it shall reduce or eliminate the forfeiture, as it finds
            
809

    
appropriate.
            
810

    
    (3)  The prosecuting attorney has the burden to demonstrate that any forfeiture is

    (4)  In all cases the court shall decide questions of proportionality.
            
813

821

    
sufficiently complex to justify the transfer;
            
822

    
    (ii)  the property may only be forfeited under federal law; or
            
823

    
    (iii)  pursuing forfeiture under state law would unreasonably burden prosecuting

attorneys or state law enforcement agencies.
