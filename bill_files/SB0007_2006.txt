354

    
that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that
            
355

    
fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or
            
356

    
sexually abused];
            
357

    
    (d)  the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child;
            
358

    
    (e)  the [minor] child has been left without any provision for [his] the child's support;
            
359

    
    (f)  a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for
            
360

    
safe and appropriate care for the [minor] child;
            
361

    
    (g)  a relative or other adult custodian with whom the [minor] child has been left by the
            
362

    
parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the [minor] child, the whereabouts
            
363

    
of the parent are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate [him have been] the parent are
            
364

    
unsuccessful;
            
365

    
    (h)  the [minor] child is in immediate need of medical care;

            
366


    
    (i)  the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to
            
367

    
the child's health or safety;
            
368

    
    (j)  the [minor] child or another [minor] child residing in the same household has been
            
369

    
neglected;
            
370

    
    (k)  the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been
            
371

    
charged or arrested pursuant to Title 58, Chapter 37d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any
            
372

    
clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section 

58-37d-3

, was located in the residence
            
373

    
or on the property where the child resided; or
            
374

    
    (l)  the child's welfare is otherwise endangered.
            
375

    
    (10) (a)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(a), if a child has previously been adjudicated as
            
376

    
abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency
            
377

    
occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the
            
378

    
custody of the child's parent.
            
379

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(c), if a parent has received actual notice that
            
380

    
physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence
            
381

    
that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that
            
382

    
fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or
            
383

    
sexually abused.
            
384

    
    [(10)] (11) (a)  The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether
            
385

    
reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the [minor] child
            
386

    
from [his] the child's home and whether there are available services that would prevent the
            
387

    
need for continued removal.  If the court finds that the [minor] child can be safely returned to
            
388

    
the custody of [his] the child's parent or guardian through the provision of those services, it
            
389

    
shall place the [minor] child with [his] the child's parent or guardian and order that those
            
390

    
services be provided by the division.
            
391

    
    (b)  In making [that] the determination described in Subsection (11)(a), and in ordering
            
392

    
and providing services, the child's health,  safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern,
            
393

    
in accordance with federal law.

            
394


    
    [(11)] (12)  Where the division's first contact with the family occurred during an
            
395

    
emergency situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a
            
396

    
finding that any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.
            
397

    
    [(12)] (13)  In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical
            
398

    
abuse or neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make
            
399

    
"reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in [his] the child's
            
400

    
home, return a child to [his] the child's home, provide reunification services, or attempt to
            
401

    
rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.
            
402

    
    [(13)] (14)  The court may not order continued removal of a [minor] child solely on the
            
403

    
basis of educational neglect as described in Subsection 

78-3a-103

(1)(s)(ii).
            
404

    
    [(14)] (15) (a)  Whenever a court orders continued removal of a [minor] child under this
            
405

    
section, it shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
406

    
    (b)  If no continued removal is ordered and the [minor] child is returned home, the court
            
407

    
shall state the facts on which that decision is based.
            
408

    
    [(15)] (16)  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are
            
409

    
necessary for the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if [he] the child
            
410

    
were returned home, it shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial
            
411

    
removal of the child, or the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other
            
412

    
procedural requirement of this chapter or Title 62A, Chapter 4a, Child and Family Services.
            
413

    
    Section 7.  
Section  
78-3a-308

 is amended to read:
            
414

    
     78-3a-308.  Pretrial and adjudication hearing -- Time deadlines.
            
415

    
    (1)  Upon the filing of a petition, the clerk of the court shall set the pretrial hearing on
            
416

    
the petition within 15 calendar days from the later of:
            
417

    
    (a)  the date of the shelter hearing; or
            
418

    
    (b)  the filing of the petition[, whichever is later].
            
419

    
    (2)  The pretrial may be continued upon motion of any party, for good cause shown, but
            
420

    
the final adjudication hearing shall be held no later than 60 calendar days from the later of:
            
421

    
    (a)  the date of the shelter hearing; or

            
422


    
    (b)  the filing of the petition[, whichever is later].
            
423

    
    [(3)  In the case where a petition has been filed but the child is not in protective custody
            
424

    
or temporary custody, the court shall give scheduling priority to the pretrial and adjudication
            
425

    
hearings on the petition if the division indicates in the petition that without expedited hearings
            
426

    
and services ordered under the protective supervision of the court the child will likely be taken
            
427

    
into protective custody.]
