West; and484          [(bbb)] (ccc)  "Canaan Mountain Grazing Zone," consisting of certain BLM lands in the485     following townships in Washington County, as more fully illustrated in the map prepared by486     the Washington County GIS department: Township 42 South Range 9.5 West, Township 42487     South Range 10 West, Township 42 South Range 11 West, Township 43 South Range 9.5488     West, Township 43 South Range 10 West, and Township 43 South Range 11 West.489          (3)  Printed copies of the maps referenced in Subsection (2) shall be available for490     inspection by the public at the offices of the Utah Association of Counties.491          (4)  The state finds with respect to the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) that:492          (a)  agricultural livestock industry on the lands comprising these zones has provided a493     significant contribution to the history, customs, culture, economy, welfare, and other values of494     each area for more than 100 years;495          (b)  the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exists within these zones496     if managed properly, that will support and expand continued, responsible agricultural livestock497     activities and wildlife habitat;498          (c)  agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources,499     human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural resources, landmarks,500     structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition,501     preservation, and protection;502          (d) (i)  the highest management priority for lands within these zones is the preservation,503     restoration, and enhancement of watershed and rangeland health to sustain and expand forage504     production for both livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, and the restoration and development505     of historic, existing, and future livestock grazing and wildlife habitat resources in order to506     provide protection for the resources, objects, customs, culture, and values identified above; and507          (ii)  notwithstanding Subsection (4)(d)(i), if part or all of any zone lies within a sage508     grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with509     the management priorities set forth in Subsection (4)(d)(i) to the maximum extent consistent510     with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area;511          (e)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any deposits of energy512     and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold,513     uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in514     these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these515     zones; and516          (f)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any recreation517     resources, including roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use, sightseeing,518     canyoneering, hunting, fishing, trapping, and hiking resources that may exist in these grazing519     zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these grazing520     zones.521          (5)  The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2) that the522     historic levels of livestock grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection (4) in each523     zone have greatly diminished, or are under other serious threat, due to:524          (a)  unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies,525     including:526          (i)  de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non-WSAs;527          (ii)  ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interior528     applicable to each of these zones; and529          (iii)  the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage;530          (b)  inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each year531     proven to be most effective for maintaining and enhancing rangeland conditions;532          (c)  mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage by533     excess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery counties;534          (d)  improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion, invasive535     species, and juniper, and other woody vegetation that:536          (i)  compromise watershed and rangeland health;537          (ii)  crowd out grazing forage;538          (iii)  degrade habitat and limit wildlife populations;539          (iv)  reduce water yield; and540          (v)  heighten the risk of catastrophic wildfire; and541          (e)  other practices that degrade overall rangeland health.542          (6)  To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection (5), the state543     supports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2):544          (a)  efficient and sustained policies, programs, and practices directed at preserving,545     restoring, and enhancing watershed and rangeland health to maximize:546          (i)  all permitted forage production for livestock grazing and other compatible uses,547     including flexible grazing on and off dates adaptive to yearly climate and range conditions; and548          (ii)  forage for fish and wildlife;549          (b)  a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and local550     government agencies to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development551     of:552          (i)  forage resources for grazing livestock and wildlife; and553          (ii)  other uses compatible with livestock grazing and wildlife utilization;554          (c)  effective and responsible management of wild horses and burros to eliminate excess555     populations; and556          (d)  effective and responsible management of wildlife habitat.557          (7)  The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within each558     grazing zone:559          (a)  fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties within560     which each grazing zone is situated to develop, amend, and implement land and resource561     management plans, and implement management decisions that are consistent with the562     purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under563     federal law;564          (b)  expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of grazing permits, range565     improvements, and applications to enhance and otherwise develop all existing and permitted566     grazing resources located within each grazing zone, including renewable vegetative resources;567          (c)  allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines,568     pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies569     described in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles;570          (d)  refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine,571     restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for each grazing zone as stated in this572     section;573          (e)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary574     to the goals and purposes described within this section; and575          (f)  refrain from implementing utilization standards less than 50%, unless:576          (i)  implementing a standard of less than 50% utilization on a temporary basis is577     necessary to resolve site-specific concerns; and578          (ii)  the federal agency consults, coordinates, and cooperates fully with local579     governments.580          (8) (a)  If a grazing zone described in Subsection (2) is managed or neglected in such a581     way as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a582     county or a county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk adversely affects the health,583     safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock584     grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that adverse effect:585          (i)  Subsections 11-51-103(1)(a) and (b) shall govern and apply to the chief executive586     officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in587     the grazing zone; and588          (ii)  Subsection 11-51-103(1)(b) shall govern and apply to the attorney general with589     respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone.590          (b)  If a grazing zone described in Subsection (2) is managed or neglected in such a way591     as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a county or a592     county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk constitutes an imminent threat to the593     health, safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock594     grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that imminent threat:595          (i)  Subsections 11-51-103(2) and (3) shall govern and apply to the chief executive596     officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in597     the grazing zone; and598          (ii)  Subsection 11-51-103(3) and Section 11-51-104 shall govern and apply to the599     attorney general with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing600     zone.601          (9) (a)  The state recognizes the importance of all grazing districts on Utah BLM and602     Forest Service lands but establishes the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) to provide603     special protection and preservation against the identified threats found in Subsection (5) to604     exist in these zones.605          (b)  It is the intent of the state to designate additional grazing agricultural commodity606     zones in future years, if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation for new607     zones.608          (10)  The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate with609     each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membership610     consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state, and local611     governments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management612     actions in zones described in Subsection (2) in order to achieve the goals, purposes, and613     policies described in this section.614          (11)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and subject to Subsection615     (4)(d)(ii), the state's mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies and plans on land within the zones616     described in Subsection (2) shall be governed by Sections 63J-4-401 and 63J-8-104.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General
