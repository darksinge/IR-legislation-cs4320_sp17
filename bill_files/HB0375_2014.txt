30-3-37
, as last amended by Laws of Utah 2012, Chapter 227
            
22

    

            
23

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
24

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
30-3-37

 is amended to read:
            
25

    
     30-3-37.  Relocation.
            
26

    
    (1)  For purposes of this section, "relocation" means moving 150 miles or more from
            
27

    
the residence of the other parent.

            
28


    
    (2)  The relocating parent shall provide 60 days advance written notice of the intended
            
29

    
relocation to the other parent.  The written notice of relocation shall contain statements
            
30

    
affirming the following:
            
31

    
    (a)  the parent-time provisions in Subsection (5) or a schedule approved by both parties
            
32

    
will be followed; and
            
33

    
    (b)  neither parent will interfere with the other's parental rights pursuant to court
            
34

    
ordered parent-time arrangements, or the schedule approved by both parties.
            
35

    
    (3)  The court shall, upon motion of any party or upon the court's own motion, schedule
            
36

    
a hearing with notice to review the notice of relocation and parent-time schedule as provided in
            
37

    
Section 

30-3-35


 and make appropriate orders regarding the parent-time and costs for
            
38

    
parent-time transportation.
            
39

    
    (4)  In a hearing to review the notice of relocation, the court shall, in determining if the
            
40

    
relocation of a custodial parent is in the best interest of the child, consider any other factors that
            
41

    
the court considers relevant to the determination.  If the court determines that relocation is not
            
42

    
in the best interest of the child, and the custodial parent relocates, the court may order a change
            
43

    
of custody.
            
44

    
    (5)  If the court finds that the relocation is in the best interest of the child, the court shall
            
45

    
determine the parent-time schedule and allocate the transportation costs that will be incurred
            
46

    
for the child to visit the noncustodial parent.  In making its determination, court shall consider:
            
47

    
    (a)  the reason for the parent's relocation;
            
48

    
    (b)  the additional costs or difficulty to both parents in exercising parent-time;
            
49

    
    (c)  the economic resources of both parents; and
            
50

    
    (d)  other factors the court considers necessary and relevant.
            
51

    
    (6)  Unless otherwise ordered by the court, upon the relocation, as defined in
            
52

    
Subsection (1), of one of the parties the following schedule shall be the minimum requirements
            
53

    
for parent-time [with a school-age child] for children 5 to 18 years of age:
            
54

    
    (a)  in years ending in an odd number, the child shall spend the following holidays with
            
55

    
the noncustodial parent:
            
56

    
    (i)  Thanksgiving holiday beginning Wednesday until Sunday; and
            
57

    
    (ii)  Spring break, if applicable, beginning the last day of school before the holiday until
            
58

    
the day before school resumes;

            
59


    
    (b)  in years ending in an even number, the child shall spend the following holidays
            
60

    
with the noncustodial parent:
            
61

    
    (i)  the entire winter school break period; and
            
62

    
    (ii)  the Fall school break beginning the last day of school before the holiday until the
            
63

    
day before school resumes;
            
64

    
    (c)  extended parent-time equal to 1/2 of the summer or off-track time for consecutive
            
65

    
weeks.  The children should be returned to the custodial home no later than seven days before
            
66

    
school begins; however, this week shall be counted when determining the amount of
            
67

    
parent-time to be divided between the parents for the summer or off-track period; and
            
68

    
    (d)  one weekend per month, at the option and expense of the noncustodial parent.
            
69

    
    (7)  The noncustodial parent's monthly weekend entitlement is subject to the following
            
70

    
restrictions.
            
71

    
    (a)  If the noncustodial parent has not designated a specific weekend for parent-time,
            
72

    
the noncustodial parent shall receive the last weekend of each month unless a holiday assigned
            
73

    
to the custodial parent falls on that particular weekend.  If a holiday assigned to the custodial
            
74

    
parent falls on the last weekend of the month, the noncustodial parent shall be entitled to the
            
75

    
next to the last weekend of the month.
            
76

    
    (b)  If a noncustodial parent's extended parent-time or parent-time over a holiday
            
77

    
extends into or through the first weekend of the next month, that weekend shall be considered
            
78

    
the noncustodial parent's monthly weekend entitlement for that month.
            
79

    
    (c)  If a child is out of school for teacher development days or snow days after the
            
80

    
children begin the school year, or other days not included in the list of holidays in Subsection
            
81

    
(6) and those days are contiguous with the noncustodial parent's monthly weekend parent-time,
            
82

    
those days shall be included in the weekend parent-time.
            
83

    
    (8)  The custodial parent is entitled to all parent-time not specifically allocated to the
            
84

    
noncustodial parent.
            
85

    
    (9)  In the event finances and distance preclude the exercise of minimum parent-time
            
86

    
for the noncustodial parent during the school year, the court should consider awarding more
            
87

    
time for the noncustodial parent during the summer time if it is in the best interests of the
            
88

    
children.
            
89

    
    (10)  Upon the motion of any party, the court may order uninterrupted parent-time with

            
90


    
the noncustodial parent for a minimum of 30 days during extended parent-time, unless the
            
91

    
court finds it is not in the best interests of the child.  If the court orders uninterrupted
            
92

    
parent-time during a period not covered by this section, it shall specify in its order which parent
            
93

    
is responsible for the child's travel expenses.
            
94

    
    (11)  Unless otherwise ordered by the court the relocating party shall be responsible for
            
95

    
all the child's travel expenses relating to Subsections (6)(a) and (b) and 1/2 of the child's travel
            
96

    
expenses relating to Subsection (6)(c), provided the noncustodial parent is current on all
            
97

    
support obligations.  If the noncustodial parent has been found in contempt for not being
            
98

    
current on all support obligations, the noncustodial parent shall be responsible for all of the
            
99

    
child's travel expenses under Subsection (6), unless the court rules otherwise.  Reimbursement
            
100

    
by either responsible party to the other for the child's travel expenses shall be made within 30
            
101

    
days of receipt of documents detailing those expenses.
            
102

    
    (12)  The court may apply this provision to any preexisting decree of divorce.
            
103

    
    (13)  Any action under this section may be set for an expedited hearing.
            
104

    
    (14)  A parent who fails to comply with the notice of relocation in Subsection (2) shall
            
105

    
be in contempt of the court's order.
