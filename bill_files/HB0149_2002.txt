Section  .   Retrospective operation.                                This act has retrospective operation for taxable years beginning on or after January  ,     .        Legislative Review Note      as of                  AM      This legislation allows corporate franchise and income tax and individual income tax credits to be  claimed by certain manufacturers within the manufacturing sector of the North American Industry  Classification System  NAICS , if those manufacturers meet requirements established by the  legislation.  Other manufacturers that are included within the manufacturing sector of NAICS are  not allowed to claim a tax credit.  The legislation arguably creates classes of taxpayers on the basis  of their designation under NAICS, and permits one class of taxpayers to claim a tax credit while  not allowing the other class of taxpayers to claim the tax credit.  If these classifications are  challenged as being special legislation or a violation of equal protection or uniform operation of  the laws principles, a court is likely to uphold the classifications if the court finds that the  classifications are rational and related to a reasonable statutory objective.
