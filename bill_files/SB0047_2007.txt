Section

 is amended to read:
            
2017

    
     73-5-15.  Groundwater management plan.

            
2018


    
    (1)  As used in this section:
            
2019

    
    (a)  "Critical management area" means a groundwater basin in which the groundwater
            
2020

    
withdrawals consistently exceed the safe yield.
            
2021

    
    (b)  "Safe yield" means the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a
            
2022

    
groundwater basin over a period of time without exceeding the long-term recharge of the basin
            
2023

    
or unreasonably affecting the basin's physical and chemical integrity.
            
2024

    
    (2) (a)  The state engineer may regulate groundwater withdrawals within a specific
            
2025

    
groundwater basin by adopting a groundwater management plan in accordance with this section
            
2026

    
for any groundwater basin or aquifer or combination of hydrologically connected groundwater
            
2027

    
basins or aquifers.
            
2028

    
    (b)  The objectives of a groundwater management plan are to:
            
2029

    
    (i)  limit groundwater withdrawals to safe yield;
            
2030

    
    (ii)  protect the physical integrity of the aquifer; and
            
2031

    
    (iii)  protect water quality.
            
2032

    
    (c)  The state engineer shall adopt a groundwater management plan for a groundwater
            
2033

    
basin if more than 1/3 of the water right owners in the groundwater basin request that the state
            
2034

    
engineer adopt a groundwater management plan.
            
2035

    
    (3) (a)  In developing a groundwater management plan, the state engineer may consider:
            
2036

    
    (i)  the hydrology of the groundwater basin;
            
2037

    
    (ii)  the physical characteristics of the groundwater basin;
            
2038

    
    (iii)  the relationship between surface water and groundwater, including whether the
            
2039

    
groundwater should be managed in conjunction with hydrologically connected surface waters;
            
2040

    
    (iv)  the geographic spacing and location of groundwater withdrawals;
            
2041

    
    (v)  water quality;
            
2042

    
    (vi)  local well interference; and
            
2043

    
    (vii)  other relevant factors.
            
2044

    
    (b)  The state engineer shall base the provisions of a groundwater management plan on
            
2045

    
the principles of prior appropriation.

            
2046


    
    (c) (i)  The state engineer shall use the best available scientific method to determine
            
2047

    
safe yield.
            
2048

    
    (ii)  As hydrologic conditions change or additional information becomes available, safe
            
2049

    
yield determinations made by the state engineer may be revised by following the procedures
            
2050

    
listed in Subsection (5).
            
2051

    
    (4) (a) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), the withdrawal of water from a
            
2052

    
groundwater basin shall be limited to the basin's safe yield.
            
2053

    
    (ii)  Before limiting withdrawals in a groundwater basin to safe yield, the state engineer
            
2054

    
shall:
            
2055

    
    (A)  determine the groundwater basin's safe yield; and
            
2056

    
    (B)  adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater basin.
            
2057

    
    (iii)  If the state engineer determines that groundwater withdrawals in a groundwater
            
2058

    
basin exceed the safe yield, the state engineer shall regulate groundwater rights in that
            
2059

    
groundwater basin based on the priority date of the water rights under the groundwater
            
2060

    
management plan, unless a voluntary arrangement exists under Subsection (4)(c) that requires a
            
2061

    
different distribution.
            
2062

    
    (b)  When adopting a groundwater management plan for a critical management area, the
            
2063

    
state engineer shall, based on economic and other impacts to an individual water user or a local
            
2064

    
community caused by the implementation of safe yield limits on withdrawals, allow gradual
            
2065

    
implementation of the groundwater management plan.
            
2066

    
    (c) (i)  In consultation with the state engineer, water users in a groundwater basin may
            
2067

    
agree to participate in a voluntary arrangement for managing withdrawals at any time, either
            
2068

    
before or after a determination that groundwater withdrawals exceed the groundwater basin's
            
2069

    
safe yield.
            
2070

    
    (ii)  A voluntary arrangement under Subsection (4)(c)(i) shall be consistent with other
            
2071

    
law.
            
2072

    
    (iii)  The adoption of a voluntary arrangement under this Subsection (4)(c) by less than
            
2073

    
all of the water users in a groundwater basin does not affect the rights of water users who do

            
2074


    
not agree to the voluntary arrangement.
            
2075

    
    (5)  To adopt a groundwater management plan, the state engineer shall:
            
2076

    
    (a)  give notice as specified in Subsection (7) at least 30 days before the first public
