This act modifies provisions related to the State Textbook Commission by changing its name

 reviewed by the commission to include workbooks, computer software, laserdiscs or

 "instructional materials" throughout Chapter 14 of Title 53A.  The act extends the existence
            

    
 of the commission through July 1, 2011, under the Legislative Oversight and Sunset Act.
