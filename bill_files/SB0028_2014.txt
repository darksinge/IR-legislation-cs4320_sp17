1235

    
    (a)  If the retiree is at least 65 years of age or has accrued at least 30 years of service

1259

    
    (c)  Option Four is a reduced allowance paid to and throughout the lifetime of the
            
1260

1261

    
paid to and throughout the lifetime of the retiree's lawful spouse at the time of retirement.

            
1262


    
    (d)  Option Five is a modification of Option Three so that if the lawful spouse at the
            
1263

    
time of retirement predeceases the retiree, an allowance equivalent to the amount payable at the
