40

    
minor children as it considers appropriate.
            
41

    
    (a)  In determining any form of custody, the court shall consider the best interests of the
            
42

    
child [and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the following:].
            
43

    
    [(i)  the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties;]
            
44

    (b)  The court shall, in every case, [consider joint custody but may award any form of
            
50

    
custody which is determined to be] presume that joint legal and physical custody that
            
51

    
designates equal parent-time and equal custody between the parents of all minor children is in

proof that joint legal and physical custody is not in the best interest of the minor child.
            
55

    
    (c)  The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact
            
56

64

    
(1)(d), they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be
            
65

    
obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only

method to ascertain the child's desires regarding custody.

    [(2)  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds
            
68

    
relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing

the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds
            
70

    
appropriate.]
            
71

    
    [(3)] (2)  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court
            
72

    
shall take that evidence into consideration in determining [whether] how to award custody [to

available to supplement the parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of

88

    
Title 78B, Chapter 6, Part 1, Utah Adoption Act.

    [(5)  This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint

            
90


    
legal custody, joint physical custody or sole custody, but allows the court and the family the
            
91

    
widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.]

    (g)  the maturity of the parents and their willingness and ability to protect the child from

parent, the court's order shall require the parents to:

by the parent having physical custody of the child at the [majority of the] time the issue arises

the court to order support of the child, including payments by one custodian to the other.

custodians if they are not the parents, the court may, after a hearing, modify or terminate an
            
200

    
order that established joint legal or physical custody if:
            
201

    
    (a)  the verified petition or accompanying affidavit initially alleges that admissible
            
202

    
evidence will show that the circumstances of the child or one or both parents or joint legal or
            
203

    
physical custodians have materially and substantially changed since the entry of the order to be
            
204

    
modified;
            
205

    
    (b)  a modification of the terms and conditions of the order would be an improvement
            
206

    
for and in the best interest of the child; and
            
207

    
    (c) (i)  both parents have complied in good faith with the dispute resolution procedure
            
208

    
in accordance with Subsection 

30-3-10.3

30-3-10

 and

    (b)  The court shall make specific written findings on each of the factors relied upon
            
218

    
stating:

    (c)  The court shall give substantial weight to the existing joint legal or physical custody
            
223

    
order when the child is thriving, happy, and well-adjusted.

physical custody or both, or any other type of shared parenting arrangement, shall file and serve

    (1)  In any proceeding under this chapter, including actions for paternity, [any] a party
            
238

    
[requesting joint custody, joint legal or physical custody, or any other type of shared parenting
            
239

    
arrangement,] shall file and serve a proposed parenting plan at the time of the filing of their
            
240

    
original petition or at the time of filing their answer or counterclaim.
            
241

    
    (2)  If a party in any action under this chapter, including actions for paternity, requests
            
242

    
custody of a minor child that is not joint physical custody, joint legal custody, or both, the party
            
243

    
shall articulate within the parenting plan:
            
244

    
    (a)  substantial justification for the deviation from joint custody;

            
245


    
    (b)  a proposed parent-time schedule that provides both parents with meaningful
            
246

    
opportunities to share in the parenting of the child; and
            
247

    
    (c)  any other information necessary to enable the court to make a determination in the

child's best interest and the parental relationship.

    [(2)] (3)  In proceedings for a modification of custody provisions or modification of a

may move the court for an order of default to adopt the plan if the other party fails to file a
            
254

    
proposed parenting plan as required by this section.  However, a parenting plan entered by
            
255

    
default may not provide a parent with less than joint physical and joint legal custody without a
            
256

    
hearing to determine whether less parent-time is in the best interest of the child.
            
257

    
    [(4)] (5)  Either party may file and serve an amended proposed parenting plan according
            
258

262

    
verified statement, signed by both parents, shall be attached.

    [(7)] (8)  If the parents file inconsistent parenting plans, the court may appoint a
            
264

    
guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the child, who may, if necessary, file a
            
265

    
separate parenting plan reflecting the best interests of the child.
