Section         g         is amended to read                                      g    .  Scope    Choice of law.                                    This chapter applies to determinations of parentage in this state.                                    The tribunal shall apply the law of this state to adjudicate the parent child                           relationship.  The applicable law may not depend upon                                 a   the place of birth of the child  or                                b   the past or present residence of the child.                                    This chapter may not create, enlarge, or diminish parental rights or duties under                           other laws of this state.                                     This chapter does not authorize or prohibit an agreement between a woman and a                          man and another woman in which the woman relinquishes all rights as a parent of a child                          conceived by means of assisted reproduction, and which provides that the man and other                          woman become the parents of the child.  If a birth results under such an agreement and the                          agreement is unenforceable under the law of this state, the parent child relationship is                          determined as provided in Part  , Parent child Relationship.

The affidavit described in Subsection     shall itemize the following items in                          connection with the gestational agreement                                 a   all legal expenses, maternity expenses, medical or hospital expenses, and living                          expenses that have been or will be paid to or on behalf of the gestational mother, including the                          source of payment                                 b   all gifts, property, or other items that have been or will be provided to the                          gestational mother, including the source of the gifts, property, or other items                                 c   the state of residence of the                                 i   gestational mother  and                                ii   the intended parents  and                                d   a description of services provided to the intended parents in connection with the                             agreement.                                    A copy of the affidavit described in Subsection     shall be provided to each party                          to the gestational agreement.                                    If the tribunal orders the record of any proceedings under this chapter sealed, the                          affidavit required by this section may not be sealed with the record, but shall remain a public                          document.
