As used in this section,  parent  means a student s biological or adoptive parent.                                    The meaning of  resident student  is determined by reference to the general law on                           the subject of domicile, except as provided in this section.                                    a   Institutions within the state system of higher education may grant resident                           student status to any student who has come to Utah and established residency for the purpose of                           attending an institution of higher education, and who, prior to registration as a resident student                                 i  has maintained continuous Utah residency status for one full year                                 ii   has signed a written declaration that the student has relinquished residency in any                           other state  and                                iii   has submitted objective evidence that the student has taken overt steps to establish                           permanent residency in Utah and that the student does not maintain a residence elsewhere.                                b   Evidence to satisfy the requirements under Subsection     a  iii  includes                                 i   a Utah high school transcript issued in the past year confirming attendance at a Utah                           high school in the past    months                                 ii   a Utah voter registration dated a reasonable period prior to application                                 iii   a Utah driver license or identification card with an original date of issue or a                           renewal date several months prior to application                                 iv   a Utah vehicle registration dated a reasonable period prior to application                                 v   evidence of employment in Utah for a reasonable period prior to application                                 vi   proof of payment of Utah resident income taxes for the previous year                                 vii   a rental agreement showing the student s name and Utah address for at least                                 months prior to application  and                                viii   utility bills showing the student s name and Utah address for at least    months                           prior to application.                                c   A student who is claimed as a dependent on the tax returns of a person who is not a                           resident of Utah is not eligible to apply for resident student status.                                    An institution within the state system of higher education may establish stricter                           criteria for determining resident student status , so long as the criteria do not require                          nonresident students to do more than complete    credit hours while maintaining continuous                          Utah residency, or maintain continuous Utah residency for   years, whichever comes first .                                     a   An institution within the state system of higher education may require students                          transferring from another institution within the state system of higher education to demonstrate                          completion of a minimum number of credit hours as a condition of receiving resident student                          status, so long as those credit hour policies do not require transferring students to complete                          more than    credit hours prior to transferring.                                  b   In the absence of       If an institution does not have a minimum credit hour                           requirement,  an  that institution shall honor the decision of another institution within the state                           system of higher education to grant a student resident student status, unless                                  i    a   the student obtained resident student status under false pretenses  or                                 ii    b   the facts existing at the time of the granting of resident student status have                           changed.                                    Within the limits established in Title   B, Chapter  , Tuition Waivers and                           Scholarships, each institution within the state system of higher education may, regardless of its                           policy on obtaining resident student status, waive nonresident tuition either in whole or in part,                           but not other fees.                                    In addition to the waivers of nonresident tuition under Subsection    , each                           institution may, as athletic scholarships, grant full waiver of fees and nonresident tuition, up to                           the maximum number allowed by the appropriate athletic conference as recommended by the                           president of each institution.                                    a   i   Personnel of the United States Armed Forces assigned to active duty in Utah,                           and the immediate members of their families residing with them in this state are entitled to                           resident status for tuition purposes.                                   ii   Except as provided in Subsection     b , upon the termination of active duty status,                           the military personnel and their family members are governed by the standards applicable to                           nonmilitary persons.                                b   Military personnel who had Utah residency immediately prior to their active duty                           status and who reestablish residency in Utah upon the termination of active duty status are                           entitled to resident status for themselves and the immediate members of their families residing                           with them for tuition purposes.                                    a   Aliens who are present in the United States on visitor, student, or other visas                           which authorize only temporary presence in this country, do not have the capacity to intend to                           reside in Utah for an indefinite period and therefore are classified as nonresidents.                                 b   Aliens who have been granted immigrant or permanent resident status in the United                            States are classified for purposes of resident status according to the same criteria applicable to                            citizens.

faith, based on an                            employer requested transfer to Utah, recruitment by a Utah employer, or a comparable                            work related move for full time permanent

                 athlete shall be subject to the same residency standards applicable to other persons under this                            section.                                    c   Time spent domiciled in Utah during the Olympic athlete training program in Utah                            counts for Utah residency for tuition purposes upon termination of the athlete s participation in
