 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-4-04  2:47 PM



This bill regulates software that creates advertisements on a computer as a result of visiting
certain Internet websites, and that collects information regarding the computer's Internet use.
Case law surrounding regulation of Internet activities is evolving. State regulations of Internet
activities have been challenged for violating principles such as the Commerce Clause of the
United States Constitution. Some courts have indicated that the need for national uniformity
limits a state's ability to regulate Internet activities. Under other court rulings, however, this bill
could be upheld if a court determined that the benefits this bill provides to Utahans outweigh
the burden the bill places on interstate commerce.
