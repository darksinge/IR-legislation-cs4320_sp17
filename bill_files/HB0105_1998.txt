9    AN ACT RELATING TO INSURANCE; REQUIRING HEALTH INSURANCE POLICIES

10    THAT COVER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO COVER PRESCRIPTION CONTRACEPTIVE

11    METHODS AND RELATED OUTPATIENT SERVICES; AND PROVIDING AN

12    EFFECTIVE DATE.

13    This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated 1953 as follows:

14    AMENDS:

15         31A-22-613, as last amended by Chapter 38, Laws of Utah 1996

16    Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

17        Section 1.  Section  31A-22-613 is amended to read:

18         31A-22-613.  Permitted provisions for disability insurance policies.

19        The following provisions may be contained in a disability insurance policy, but if they are

20    in that policy, they shall conform to at least the following minimum requirements for the

21    policyholder:

22        (1)  Any provision respecting change of occupation may provide only for a lower

23    maximum benefit payment and for reduction of loss payments proportionate to the change in

24    appropriate premium rates, if the change is to a higher rated occupation, and this provision shall

25    provide for retroactive reduction of premium rates from the date of change of occupation or the

26    last policy anniversary date, whichever is the more recent, if the change is to a lower rated

27    occupation.

28        (2)  Section 31A-22-405 applies to misstatement of age in disability policies, with the


1    appropriate modifications of terminology.

2        (3)  Any policy which contains a provision establishing, as an age limit or otherwise, a date

3    after which the coverage provided by the policy is not effective, and if that date falls within a

4    period for which a premium is accepted by the insurer or if the insurer accepts a premium after that

5    date, the coverage provided by the policy continues in force, subject to any right of cancellation,

6    until the end of the period for which the premium was accepted.   This subsection does not apply

7    if the acceptance of premium would not have occurred but for a misstatement of age by the

8    insured.

9        (4)  Any provision dealing with preexisting conditions shall be consistent with Subsections

10    31A-22-605(9)(a) and 31A-22-609(2), and any applicable rule adopted by the commissioner.

11        (5) (a)  If an insured is otherwise eligible for maternity benefits, a policy may not contain

12    language which requires  an insured to obtain any additional preauthorization or preapproval for

13    customary and reasonable maternity care expenses or for the delivery of the child after an initial

14    preauthorization or preapproval has been obtained from the insurer for prenatal care.  A

15    requirement for notice of admission for delivery is not a requirement for preauthorization or

16    preapproval, however, the maternity benefit may not be denied or diminished for failure to provide

17    admission notice.  The policy may not require the provision of admission notice by only the

18    insured patient.

19        (b)  This subsection does not prohibit an insurer from:

20        (i)  requiring a referral before maternity care can be obtained;

21        (ii)  specifying a group of providers or a particular location from which an insured is

22    required to obtain maternity care; or

23        (iii)  limiting reimbursement for maternity expenses and benefits in accordance with the

24    terms and conditions of the insurance contract so long as such terms do not conflict with

25    Subsection (5)(a).

26        (6)  A disability policy that provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs shall cover:

27        (a)  to the same extent and subject to the same contract terms, prescription contraceptive

28    methods approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration; and

29        (b)  outpatient services for prescription contraceptive methods approved by the federal

30    Food and Drug Administration to the same extent and subject to the same contract terms as other

31    covered outpatient services.

- 2 -


1        Section 2.   Effective date.

2        This act takes effect on July 1, 1998.
