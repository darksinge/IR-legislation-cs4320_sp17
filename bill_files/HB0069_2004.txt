36

    
    (a)  "generic form" means a prescription drug that is available in generic form and has
            
37

    
an A rating in the United States Pharmacopeia and Drug Index;
            
38

    
    (b)  "legend drug" means any drug that requires a prescription under state or federal
            
39

    
law; and
            
40

    
    (c)  "restrictive drug formulary" means a list of legend drugs, other than drugs for
            
41

    
cosmetic purposes, that are prohibited by the Utah Department of Health from dispensation, but
            
42

    
are approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration.
            
43

    
    (2)  A practitioner may prescribe legend drugs in accordance with this chapter that, in
            
44

    
his professional judgment and within the lawful scope of his practice, he considers appropriate
            
45

    
for the diagnosis and treatment of his patient.
            
46

    
    (3)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), the Utah Department of Health may not
            
47

    
maintain a restrictive drug formulary that restricts a physician's ability to treat a patient with a
            
48

    
legend drug that has been approved and designated as safe and effective by the federal Food
            
49

    
and Drug Administration, except for drugs for cosmetic purposes.
            
50

    
    (4)  When a multisource legend drug is available in the generic form, the Department of
            
51

    
Health may only reimburse for the generic form of the drug unless the treating physician
            
52

53

    
brand-name legend drug.
            
54

    (6)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a practitioner has prescribed a drug
            
57

    
by brand name and the practitioner has not indicated, by a method set forth in Subsection (10),
            
58

    
that a substitution is prohibited, the pharmacist who fills or refills the prescription shall

            
59

    (b)  is biologically equivalent to the drug prescribed by brand name;
            
62

64

    
    (d)  is of the same generic type as the drug prescribed by brand name.
            
65

    
    (7)  If the pharmacist has available to him more than one drug that may be substituted
            
66

    
for the drug prescribed by brand name, the pharmacist shall dispense, in substitution, the least
            
67

    
expensive of the drugs that are available to him for substitution.
            
68

    
    (8)  Before a pharmacist dispenses a drug in substitution for a drug prescribed by brand
            
69

    
name, the pharmacist shall:
            
70

    
    (a)  advise the person who presents the prescription that the pharmacist intends to
            
71

    
dispense a drug in substitution; and
            
72

    
    (b)  advise the person that he may refuse to accept the drug that the pharmacist intends
            
73

    
to dispense in substitution, unless the pharmacist is being paid for the drug by a governmental
            
74

    
agency, in which case the pharmacist shall dispense the drug as provided in Subsection (4).
            
75

    
    (9)  If a person refuses to accept the drug that the pharmacist intends to dispense in
            
76

    
substitution, the pharmacist shall dispense the drug prescribed by brand name, unless the

82

    
    (a)  by oral communication to the pharmacist; or
            
83

    
    (b)  by including the handwritten words "Dispense as Written" on a prescription that is

faxed prescriptions, the practitioner expressly indicates to the pharmacist that the brand name
            
86

    
drug prescribed is medically necessary by indicating "Dispense as Written."
            
87

    
    (11)  The provisions of this section also apply to a prescription issued to a person by a
            
88

Subsection (10), that a substitution is prohibited or the practitioner has indicated that a specific

            
90


    
alternative product is medically necessary.

common carrier pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; or

98

    
substitution:
            
99

    
    (i)  would violate the terms of a health care plan that maintains a mandatory, exclusive,
            
100

    
or closed formulary for its coverage for prescription drugs; or
            
101

    
    (ii)  would otherwise make the transaction ineligible for reimbursement by a third party.
