Article XII -- Rulemaking -- Authority -- Procedure -- Review --500     Rejection by Legislature.501          (1)  The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively502     and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the503     event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond504     the scope of the purposes of this compact, or the powers granted in accordance with this505     compact, then the action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or506     effect.507          (2)  Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to508     the Model State Administrative Procedure Act, of 1981, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1509     (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate Commission.510          (3)  Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for511     judicial review of the rule; provided that, the filing of a petition may not stay or otherwise512     prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a513     substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate514     Commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule515     represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.516          (4)  If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment517     of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then the rule shall have518     no further force and effect in any compacting state.519          Section 14.

The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated in accordance with the524     compact shall have standing as a rule promulgated under Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah525     Administrative Rulemaking Act.526          (2)  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or527     administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact528     which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.529          (3)  The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any530     proceeding, and have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to531     provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void532     as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.533          (4)  If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the534     performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or535     promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:536          (a)  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature537     of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate538     Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting539     state shall cure its default.540          (b)  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.541          (5)  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be542     terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and543     all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the544     effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of545     obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.546          (6)  Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only547     after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend548     or terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the majority and549     minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.550          (7)  The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all551     assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or552     termination, not to exceed $5,000 per year, as provided in Subsection 53A-1-1014(5), for each553     year that the state is a member of the compact.554          (8)  The Interstate Commission may not bear any costs relating to any state that has555     been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact,556     unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the557     defaulting state.558          (9)  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by559     petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the560     Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs561     of the litigation including reasonable attorney fees.562          (10)  The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to563     resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states564     and between member and non-member states.565          (11)  The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation566     and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.567          Section 15.

The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be576     determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all577     member states.578          (3)  The Interstate Commission may not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing579     the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of580     any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.581          (4)  The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and582     disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to583     the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and584     disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a585     certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and586     become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.587          (5)  The Interstate Commission may not assess, levy, or collect more than $5,000 per588     year from Utah legislative appropriations. Other funding sources may be accepted and used to589     offset expenses related to the state's participation in the compact.590          Section 16.

The effective date shall be no earlier than595     December 1, 2007. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding as to any other member596     state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.
