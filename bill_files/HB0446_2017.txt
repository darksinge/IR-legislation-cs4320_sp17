The chair shall39     appoint members to the panels in any combination and in accordance with rules promulgated40     by the board, except in hearings involving commutation and pardons.  The chair may41     participate on any panel and when doing so is chair of the panel.  The chair of the board may42     designate the chair for any other panel.43          (c)  No restitution may be ordered, no fine, forfeiture, or restitution remitted, no parole,44     pardon, or commutation granted or sentence terminated, except after a full hearing before the45     board or the board's appointed examiner in open session.  Any action taken under this46     subsection other than by a majority of the board shall be affirmed by a majority of the board.47          (d)  A commutation or pardon may be granted only after a full hearing before the board.48          (e)  The board may determine restitution as provided in Section 77-27-6 and Subsection49     77-38a-302(5)(d)(iii)(A).50          (2) (a)  In the case of original parole grant hearings, rehearings, and parole revocation51     hearings, timely prior notice of the time and location of the hearing shall be given to the52     defendant, the county or district attorney's office responsible for prosecution of the case, the53     sentencing court, law enforcement officials responsible for the defendant's arrest and54     conviction, and whenever possible, the victim or the victim's family.55          (b)  Notice to the victim, [his] the victim's representative, or [his] the victim's family56     shall include information provided in Section 77-27-9.5, and any related rules made by the57     board under that section.

Nothing in this section prevents the obtaining or enforcement of a62     civil judgment, including restitution as provided in Section 77-27-6.63          (4)  This chapter may not be construed as a denial of or limitation of the governor's64     power to grant respite or reprieves in all cases of convictions for offenses against the state,65     except treason or conviction on impeachment.  However, respites or reprieves may not extend66     beyond the next session of the Board of Pardons and Parole and the board, at that session, shall67     continue or terminate the respite or reprieve, or it may commute the punishment, or pardon the68     offense as provided.  In the case of conviction for treason, the governor may suspend execution69     of the sentence until the case is reported to the Legislature at its next session.  The Legislature70     shall then either pardon or commute the sentence, or direct its execution.71          (5)  In determining when, where, and under what conditions offenders serving sentences72     may be paroled, pardoned, have restitution ordered, or have their fines or forfeitures remitted,73     or their sentences commuted or terminated, the board shall:74          (a)  consider whether the persons have made or are prepared to make restitution as75     ascertained in accordance with the standards and procedures of Section 77-38a-302, as a76     condition of any parole, pardon, remission of fines or forfeitures, or commutation or77     termination of sentence[.]; and78          (b)  develop and use a list of criteria for making determinations under this Subsection79     (5).80          (6)  In determining whether parole may be terminated, the board shall consider the81     offense committed by the parolee, the parole period as provided in Section 76-3-202, and in82     accordance with Section 77-27-13.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
