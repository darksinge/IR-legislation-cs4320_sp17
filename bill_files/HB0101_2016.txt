Unless the allegedly incapacitated person has counsel of the person's own choice,31     the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the person in the proceeding the cost of which32     shall be paid by the person alleged to be incapacitated.  If the court determines that the petition33     is without merit, the attorney fees and court costs shall be paid by the person filing the petition. 34     If the court appoints the petitioner or the petitioner's nominee as guardian of the incapacitated35     person, regardless of whether the nominee is specified in the moving petition or nominated36     during the proceedings, the petitioner shall be entitled to receive from the incapacitated person37     reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred in bringing, prosecuting, or defending the38     petition.39          (3)  The legal representation of the incapacitated person by an attorney shall terminate40     upon the appointment of a guardian, unless:41          (a)  there are separate conservatorship proceedings still pending before the court42     subsequent to the appointment of a guardian;43          (b)  there is a timely filed appeal of the appointment of the guardian or the44     determination of incapacity; or45          (c)  upon an express finding of good cause, the court orders otherwise.46          (4)  The person alleged to be incapacitated may be examined by a physician appointed47     by the court who shall submit a report in writing to the court and may be interviewed by a48     visitor sent by the court.  The visitor also may interview the person seeking appointment as49     guardian, visit the present place of abode of the person alleged to be incapacitated and the place50     it is proposed that the person will be detained or reside if the requested appointment is made,51     conduct other investigations or observations as directed by the court, and submit a report in52     writing to the court.53          (5) (a)  The person alleged to be incapacitated shall be present at the hearing in person54     and see or hear all evidence bearing upon the person's condition.
