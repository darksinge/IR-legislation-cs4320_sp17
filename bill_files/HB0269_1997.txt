Legislative intent.                   The Legislature finds that public policy should promote and encourage a strong civic                   sector.  Civic organizations have an important role that cannot be adequately addressed through         either private or public sector action.  Important public values such as the condition of our         neighborhoods, the character of our children, and the renewal of our cities directly depend on the         strength of families, neighborhoods, and grassroots community organizations, as well as the         vitality of private and religious institutions that care for those in need.  Civic organizations         transmit values between generations, encourage cooperation between citizens, and ensure that our         communities are livable and nurturing environments.  The value provided to the state by civic         organizations is called social capital.                  The purpose of this part is to promote the availability of social capital.  Using social          capital,  recipients  clients of and applicants for services under this chapter may receive a wide          array of services and supports that cannot be provided by state government alone.  Social capital          links all parts of our society  together by creating opportunities for service and giving.  It facilitates          trust and cooperation and enhances investments in physical and human capital.                   In enacting this part, the Legislature recognizes the constitutional limits of state          government to sustain civic institutions that provide social capital. While state government has          always depended on these institutions, it does not create them nor can it replace them.  This part          recognizes that state government must respect, recognize, and, wherever possible, constitutionally          encourage strong civic institutions that sustain a sense of community and humanize our lives.              Section   .  Section    A      , which is renumbered from Section   A       is          renumbered and amended to read                   A       .        A      .  Relationship of civic and state services.                   a   Services and supports provided by a civic organization under this part are in          addition to, and not in lieu of, any service or support provided by the  office  division to a           recipient  client.               b   Receipt of services from a civic organization  does  may not diminish a person s          eligibility for services or supports from the  office  division.                   A person is under no obligation to receive services from a civic organization.                   A civic organization is under no obligation to provide services to a person, except as          provided in a contract between the organization and the  office  division pursuant to Section             A          A      .

The  office  division shall, in compliance with Section    A          A      , assess         whether an applicant would be receptive to and benefit by services from a civic organization.  If         so, the  office  division may inform the applicant of the availability of those services and supports.                  a   If an applicant chooses to receive those services and supports from a civic         organization, the  office  division shall facilitate the applicant s referral to one or more appropriate         civic organizations.              b   If  the  an applicant chooses not to receive the services and supports of a civic          organization or requests services and supports available under this chapter in addition to the          services and supports of a civic organization, the  office  division shall process the application as          provided under this chapter.

However, if and only if during the time prior to the original support order, the parent          normally and consistently worked more than    hours at his job, the court may consider this extra          time as a pattern in calculating the parent s ability to provide child support.                   Specifically excluded from gross income are                a    Aid to Families with Dependent Children  AFDC   cash assistance provided under          Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Family Employment Program                b   benefits received under a housing subsidy program, the Job Training Partnership Act,           S.S.I.  Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, Food          Stamps, or General Assistance  and               c   other similar means tested welfare benefits received by a parent.                   a   Gross income from self employment or operation of a business shall be calculated          by subtracting necessary expenses required for self employment or business operation from gross          receipts.  The income and expenses from self employment or operation of a business shall be          reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child          support award.  Only those expenses necessary to allow the business to operate at a reasonable          level may be deducted from gross receipts.               b   Gross income determined under this subsection may differ from the amount of business          income determined for tax purposes.                   a   When possible, gross income should first be computed on an annual basis and then          recalculated to determine the average gross monthly income.                       b   Each parent shall provide verification of current income.  Each parent shall provide         year to date pay stubs or employer statements and complete copies of tax returns from at least the         most recent year unless the court finds the verification is not reasonably available.  Verification         of income from records maintained by the Office of Employment Security may be substituted for         pay stubs, employer statements, and income tax returns.              c   Historical and current earnings shall be used to determine whether an         underemployment or overemployment situation exists.                  Gross income includes income imputed to the parent under Subsection    .                  a   Income may not be imputed to a parent unless the parent stipulates to the amount          imputed or a hearing is held and a finding made that the parent is voluntarily unemployed or          underemployed.               b   If income is imputed to a parent, the income shall be based upon employment potential          and probable earnings as derived from work history, occupation qualifications, and prevailing          earnings for persons of similar backgrounds in the community.               c   If a parent has no recent work history, income shall be imputed at least at the federal          minimum wage for a    hour work week.  To impute a greater income, the judge in a judicial          proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding shall enter specific findings          of fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.               d   Income may not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist                i   the reasonable costs of child care for the parents  minor children approach or equal the          amount of income the custodial parent can earn                ii   a parent is physically or mentally disabled to the extent he cannot earn minimum wage                iii   a parent is engaged in career or occupational training to establish basic job skills  or               iv   unusual emotional or physical needs of a child require the custodial parent s presence          in the home.                   a   Gross income may not include the earnings of a child who is the subject of a child          support award nor benefits to a child in the child s own right such as Supplemental Security          Income.               b   Social Security benefits received by a child due to the earnings of a parent may be          credited as child support to the parent upon whose earning record it is based, by crediting the          amount against the potential obligation of that parent.  Other unearned income of a child may be                  considered as income to a parent depending upon the circumstances of each case.             Section   .  Section         .   is amended to read                      .  .  Reduction for extended visitation.                  The child support order shall provide that the base child support award be reduced by             for each child for time periods during which the child is with the noncustodial parent by order         of the court or by written agreement of the parties for at least    of any    consecutive days.  If         the dependent child is a  recipient  client of  Aid to Families with Dependent Children  cash         assistance provided under Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Family Employment Program, any         agreement by the parties for reduction of child support during extended visitation shall be          approved by the administrative agency.  However, normal visitation and holiday visits to the          custodial parent shall not be considered an interruption of the consecutive day requirement.                   For purposes of this section the per child amount to which the abatement applies shall          be calculated by dividing the base child support award by the number of children included in the          award.              Section   .   Commission of study.

The department, in accordance with Title   , Chapter   , Utah Procurement Code,          shall contract with an organization to conduct this study.  Proposals for the study shall be sent to                  a nationwide pool of applicants, and the organization selected shall have demonstrated expertise         and experience in evaluating large and complex social policy issues.                  The department shall send a copy of the study to the legislative interim committee that         has oversight responsibilities for the Department of Workforce Services.             Section   .
