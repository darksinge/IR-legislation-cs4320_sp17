OIL AND GAS ROYALTY AMENDMENTS                 GENERAL SESSION          STATE OF UTAH           Sponsor  Beverly Ann Evans          AN ACT RELATING TO MINES AND MINING  CLARIFYING THAT THE         ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO ROYALTY OWNERS UNDER THIS         CHAPTER DO NOT NEED TO BE PURSUED OR EXHAUSTED PRIOR TO FILING A         LAWSUIT.         This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                      , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section         is amended to read                      .  Proceeds from sale of production    Payment of proceeds    Requirements              Proceeding on petition to determine cause of nonpayment    Remedies    Penalties.                     a   The oil and gas proceeds derived from the sale of production from any well          producing oil or gas in the state shall be paid to any person legally entitled to the payment of the          proceeds not later than     days after the first day of the month following the date of the first sale          and thereafter not later than    days after the end of the calendar month within which payment is          received by the payor for production, unless other periods or arrangements are provided for in a          valid contract with the person entitled to the proceeds.               b   The payment shall be made directly to the person entitled to the payment by the payor.               c   The payment is considered to have been made upon deposit in the United States mail.                   Payments shall be remitted to any person entitled to oil and gas proceeds annually for          the aggregate of up to    months accumulation of proceeds, if the total amount owed is      or          less.                   a   Any delay in determining whether a person is legally entitled to an interest in the           oil and gas proceeds does not affect payments to other persons entitled to payment.              b   i   If accrued payments cannot be made within the time limits specified in Subsection             or    , the payor shall deposit all oil and gas proceeds credited to the eventual oil and gas         proceeds owner to an escrow account in a federally insured bank or savings and loan institution         using a standard escrow document form.              ii   The deposit shall earn interest at the highest rate being offered by that institution for         the amount and term of similar demand deposits.              iii   The escrow agent may commingle money received into escrow from any one lessee         or operator, purchaser, or other person legally responsible for payment.               iv   Payment of principal and accrued interest from the escrow account shall be made by          the escrow agent to the person legally entitled to them within    days from the date of receipt by          the escrow agent of final legal determination of entitlement to the payment.               v   Applicable escrow fees shall be deducted from the payments.                   Any person entitled to oil and gas proceeds may file a petition with the board to          conduct a hearing to determine why the proceeds have not been paid.                   Upon receipt of the petition, the board shall set the matter for investigation and          negotiation by the division within    days.                   a   If the matter cannot be resolved by negotiation as of that date, the board may set          a hearing within    days.               b   If the board does not set a hearing, any information gathered during the investigation          and negotiation shall be given to the petitioner who may then seek a remedy in a court of          competent jurisdiction.                   a   If, after a hearing, the board finds the proceeds have not been deposited in an          interest bearing escrow account in accordance with Subsection    , the board may order that                i   a complete accounting be made  and               ii   the proceeds be subject to an interest rate of        per month, as a substitute for an          escrow account interest rate, accruing from the date the payment should have been suspended in          accordance with Subsection    .               b   If, after a hearing, the board finds the delay of payment is without reasonable          justification, the board may                i   if the proceeds have been deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance                 with Subsection                   A   order a complete accounting               B   require the proceeds and accruing interest to remain in the escrow account  and              C   assess a penalty of up to     of the total proceeds and interest in the escrow account          or              ii   if the proceeds have not been deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in         accordance with Subsection    , assess a penalty of up to     of the total proceeds and interest         as determined under Subsection  a .              c   i   Upon finding that the delay of payment is without reasonable justification, the board          shall set a date not later than    days from the hearing for final distribution of the total sum.               ii   If payment is not made by the required date, the total proceeds, interest, and any          penalty as provided in Subsection  b  shall be subject to interest at a rate of        per month until          paid.               d   If, after a hearing, the board finds the delay of payment is with reasonable justification          and the proceeds have been deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with          Subsection    , the payor may not be required to make an accounting or payment of appropriately          suspended proceeds until the condition which justified suspension has been satisfied.                   The circumstances under which the board may find the suspension of payment of          proceeds is made with reasonable justification, such that the penalty provisions of Subsections              b  and     c  ii  do not apply, include, but are not limited to, the following                a   the payor                i   fails to make the payment in good faith reliance upon a title opinion by a licensed Utah          attorney objecting to the lack of good and marketable title of record of the person claiming          entitlement to payment  and               ii   furnishes a copy of the relevant portions of the opinion to the person for necessary          curative action                b   the payor receives information which                i   in the payor s good faith judgment, brings into question the entitlement of the person          claiming the right to the payment to receive that payment                ii   has rendered the title unmarketable  or               iii   may expose the payor to the risk of liability to third parties if the payment is made                       c   the total amount of oil and gas proceeds in possession of the payor owed to the person         making claim to payment is less than      at the end of any month  or              d   the person entitled to payment has failed or refused to execute a division or transfer         order acknowledging the proper interest to which the person claims to be entitled and setting forth         the mailing address to which payment may be directed, provided the division or transfer order does         not alter or amend the terms of the lease.                  If the circumstances described in Subsection     a  or  b  arise, the payor may               a   suspend and escrow the payments in accordance with Subsection      or              b   at the request and expense of the person claiming entitlement to the payment, make the          payment into court on an interpleader action to resolve the claim and avoid liability under this          chapter.                    A person damaged by a violation of this chapter may file suit in a court of competent          jurisdiction at any time and is not required to pursue or exhaust any administrative remedy          available under this chapter prior to filing the lawsuit.
