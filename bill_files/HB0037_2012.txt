Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
32

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
78B-12-210

 is amended to read:
            
33

    
     78B-12-210.  Application of guidelines -- Use of ordered child support.
            
34

    
    (1)  The guidelines in this chapter apply to any judicial or administrative order
            
35

    
establishing or modifying an award of child support entered on or after July 1, 1989.
            
36

    
    (2) (a)  The guidelines shall be applied as a rebuttable presumption in establishing or
            
37

    
modifying the amount of temporary or permanent child support.
            
38

    
    (b)  The rebuttable presumption means the provisions and considerations required by
            
39

    
the guidelines, the award amounts resulting from the application of the guidelines, and the use
            
40

    
of worksheets consistent with these guidelines are presumed to be correct, unless rebutted
            
41

    
under the provisions of this section.
            
42

    
    (3)  A written finding or specific finding on the record supporting the conclusion that
            
43

    
complying with a provision of the guidelines or ordering an award amount resulting from use
            
44

    
of the guidelines would be unjust, inappropriate, or not in the best interest of a child in a
            
45

    
particular case is sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case.  If an order rebuts the
            
46

    
presumption through findings, it is considered a deviated order.
            
47

    
    (4)  The following shall be considered deviations from the guidelines, if:
            
48

    
    (a)  the order includes a written finding that it is a deviation from the guidelines;
            
49

    
    (b)  the guidelines worksheet has:
            
50

    
    (i)  the box checked for a deviation; and
            
51

    
    (ii)  an explanation as to the reason; or
            
52

    
    (c)  the deviation is made because there were more children than provided for in the
            
53

    
guidelines table.
            
54

    
    (5)  If the amount in the order and the amount on the guidelines worksheet differ by $10
            
55

    
or more:
            
56

    
    (a)  the order is considered deviated; and
            
57

    
    (b)  the incomes listed on the worksheet may not be used in adjusting support for
            
58

    
emancipation.

            
59


    
    (6) (a)  Natural or adoptive children of either parent who live in the home of that parent
            
60

    
and are not children in common to both parties may at the option of either party be taken into
            
61

    
account under the guidelines in setting [or modifying] a child support award, as provided in
            
62

    
Subsection (7).  [Credit may not be given if:]
            
63

    
    [(i)  by giving credit to the obligor, children for whom a prior support order exists
            
64

    
would have their child support reduced; or]
            
65

    
    [(ii)  by giving credit to the obligee for a present family, the obligation of the obligor
            
66

    
would increase.]
            
67

    
    (b)  Additional worksheets shall be prepared that compute the [obligations] base child
            
68

    
support award of the respective parents for the additional children.  The [obligations] base
            
69

    
child support award shall then be subtracted from the appropriate parent's income before
            
70

    
determining the award in the instant case.
            
71

    
    (7)  In a proceeding to adjust or modify an existing award, consideration of natural or
            
72

    
adoptive children born after entry of the order and who are not in common to both parties may
            
73

    
be applied to mitigate an increase in the award but may not be applied:
            
74

    
    (a)  for the benefit of the obligee if the credit would increase the support obligation of
            
75

    
the obligor from the most recent order; or
            
76

    
    (b)  for the benefit of the obligor if the amount of support received by the obligee would
            
77

    
be decreased from the most recent order.
            
78

    
    (8) (a)  If a child support order has not been issued or modified within the previous
            
79

    
three years, a parent, legal guardian, or the office may move the court to adjust the amount of a
            
80

    
child support order.
            
81

    
    (b)  Upon receiving a motion under Subsection (8)(a), the court shall, taking into
            
82

    
account the best interests of the child:
            
83

    
    (i)  determine whether there is a difference between the payor's ordered support amount
            
84

    
and the payor's support amount that would be required under the guidelines; and
            
85

    
    (ii)  if there is a difference as described in Subsection (8)(b)(i), adjust the payor's
            
86

    
ordered support amount to the payor's support amount provided in the guidelines if:
            
87

    
    (A)  the difference is 10% or more;
            
88

    
    (B)  the difference is not of a temporary nature; and
            
89

    
    (C)  the order adjusting the payor's ordered support amount does not deviate from the

            
90


    
guidelines.
            
91

    
    (c)  A showing of a substantial change in circumstances is not necessary for an
            
92

    
adjustment under this Subsection (8).
            
93

    
    (9) (a)  A parent, legal guardian, or the office may at any time petition the court to
            
94

    
adjust the amount of a child support order if there has been a substantial change in
            
95

    
circumstances.  A change in the base combined child support obligation table set forth in
            
96

    
Section 

78B-12-301

 is not a substantial change in circumstances for the purposes of this
            
97

    
Subsection (9).
            
98

    
    (b)  For purposes of this Subsection (9), a substantial change in circumstances may
            
99

    
include:
            
100

    
    (i)  material changes in custody;
            
101

    
    (ii)  material changes in the relative wealth or assets of the parties;
            
102

    
    (iii)  material changes of 30% or more in the income of a parent;
            
103

    
    (iv)  material changes in the employment potential and ability of a parent to earn;
            
104

    
    (v)  material changes in the medical needs of the child; or
            
105

    
    (vi)  material changes in the legal responsibilities of either parent for the support of
            
106

    
others.
            
107

    
    (c)  Upon receiving a petition under Subsection (9)(a), the court shall, taking into
            
108

    
account the best interests of the child:
            
109

    
    (i)  determine whether a substantial change has occurred;
            
110

    
    (ii)  if a substantial change has occurred, determine whether the change results in a
            
111

    
difference of 15% or more between the payor's ordered support amount and the payor's support
            
112

    
amount that would be required under the guidelines; and
            
113

    
    (iii)  adjust the payor's ordered support amount to that which is provided for in the
            
114

    
guidelines if:
            
115

    
    (A)  there is a difference of 15% or more; and
            
116

    
    (B)  the difference is not of a temporary nature.
            
117

    
    (10)  Notice of the opportunity to adjust a support order under Subsections (8) and (9)
            
118

    
shall be included in each child support order.
