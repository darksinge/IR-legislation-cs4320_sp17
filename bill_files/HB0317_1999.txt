They have                           the right to employ counsel of their own choice and if any of them requests an attorney and is                           found by the court to be indigent, counsel shall be appointed by the court as provided in Subsection                              .  The court may appoint counsel without a request if it considers representation by counsel                           necessary to protect the interest of the minor or of other parties.                                b   The cost of appointed counsel for an indigent minor  or other indigent party , including                           the cost of counsel and expense of appeal, shall be paid by the county in which the hearing is held.                            Counties may levy and collect taxes for these purposes.                                   c   The cost of appointed counsel for an indigent party to proceedings initiated and                          prosecuted by the attorney general pursuant to Section       A  a         shall be paid by the state.                                d   Neither the county nor the state shall have any responsibility to pay costs of counsel                          or expenses of appeal for petitions filed pursuant to this chapter by private parties.                                e   The court shall take into account the income and financial ability to retain counsel of                          the parents or guardian of a minor in determining the indigency of the minor.                                    If the state or county responsible to provide legal counsel for an indigent under                           Subsection     b  or  c  has arranged by contract to provide services, the court if it has received                           notice or a copy of such contract shall appoint the contracting attorney as legal counsel to represent                           that indigent.                                    The court shall select and appoint the attorney or attorneys if                                 a   the contract for indigent legal services is with multiple attorneys  or                                b   the contract is with an additional attorney or attorneys in the event of a conflict of                           interest.                                    If the court considers the appointment of a noncontracting attorney to provide legal                           services to an indigent despite the existence of an indigent legal services contract and the court has                           a copy or notice of such contract, before the court may make the appointment, it shall                                 a   set the matter for a hearing                                 b   give proper notice to the attorney general or county attorney of the responsible county                           of the hearing  and                                c   make findings that there is a compelling reason to appoint a noncontracting attorney                           before it may make such appointment.                                    The indigent s mere preference for other counsel shall not be considered a compelling                           reason justifying the appointment of a noncontracting attorney.                                    The court may order a minor, parent, guardian, or custodian for whom counsel is                           appointed and the parents or guardian of any minor for whom counsel is appointed to reimburse                           the county for the cost of appointed counsel.                                    If the minor and other parties were not represented by counsel, the court shall inform                           them at the conclusion of the proceedings that they have the right to appeal.
