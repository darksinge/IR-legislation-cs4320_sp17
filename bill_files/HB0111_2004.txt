1583

    
improvements are proposed to be made may be described by reference to streets or portions of

streets or extensions of streets or by any other means the governing body may choose that

1586

    
    (e)  The notice shall state the estimated cost of the improvements as determined by the
            
1587

    
engineer of the municipality. If the actual cost of the improvements exceeds the estimated cost,
            
1588

    
the governing body shall nevertheless have the right to levy assessments in excess of the
            
1589

    
estimated cost.
            
1590

    
    (f)  The notice shall state that it is proposed to levy assessments on property in the
            
1591

    
district to pay all or a portion of the cost of the improvements according to the benefits to be
            
1592

    
derived by the property.

    (h)  The notice shall state the method for determining the necessary number of protests
            
1597

    
required to be filed under Subsection 

17A-3-307

(3).
            
1598

    
    (i)  If the governing body elects to create and fund from assessments a separate reserve
            
1599

    
fund for the proposed bond issue as provided in Section 

17A-3-335

, the notice shall describe
            
1600

    
how the reserve fund would be funded and how the remaining moneys on deposit in the reserve
            
1601

    
fund would be disbursed with payment in full of the bonds.
            
1602

    
    (j)  If the governing body desires to create a special improvement district wherein only
            
1603

    
properties are assessed, the owners of which voluntarily consent to an assessment, the notice
            
1604

    
shall include a consent form to be used to obtain the consent of each owner of property to be
            
1605

    (i)  estimates the total assessment to be levied against the particular piece of property;

1610

    
received by the [recorder] clerk of the governing body.
            
1611

    
    (2)  The notice may contain other information the governing body determines to be
            
1612

    
appropriate, including the amount or proportion of the cost of the improvements to be paid for
            
1613

    
by the municipality or from sources other than assessments, the estimated amount of each type
            
1614

    
of assessment for the various improvements to be made according to the method of assessment
            
1615

    
chosen by the governing body, and provisions for any optional improvements. The failure to
            
1616

    
include this information may not be [deemed] considered jurisdictional or a defect preventing
            
1617

    
the municipality from proceeding with the special improvement district. The inclusion of any
            
1618

    
permitted information is not considered a limitation on the municipality from subsequently
            
1619

    
changing its plans in regard to any of the information.

1678

    
"owner" and shall be so mailed addressed to the street number of each piece of improved
            
1679

then the post office box, rural route number, or any other mailing address of the improved
            
1681

    
property shall be used for the mailing of the notice.  The notice shall be mailed at least 15 days

Subsection (6), have been held, the board shall report to the governing body its findings that
            
1685

    
each piece of property within the special improvement district will be benefited in an amount
            
1686

    
not less than the assessment to be levied against the property, and that no piece of property
            
1687

    
listed on the assessment will bear more than its proportionate share of the cost of the
            
1688

    
improvement.

1691

    
against his property.
            
1692

    
    (c)  The findings of the board, when approved by the governing body or after passage of

the board of equalization and review to raise his objections to the levy of the assessment shall
            
1700

    
be [deemed] considered to have waived all objections to the levy except the objection that the
            
1701

    
governing body failed to obtain jurisdiction to order the making of the improvements which the

            
1702


    
assessment is intended to pay.
