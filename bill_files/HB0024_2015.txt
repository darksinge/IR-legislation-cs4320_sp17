Acquisitions involving insurers not otherwise covered.1779          (1)  The following definitions apply for the purposes of this section only:1780          (a)  "Acquisition" means an agreement, arrangement, or activity the consummation of1781     which results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person and1782     includes the acquisition of voting securities, the acquisition of assets, bulk reinsurance, and1783     mergers.1784          (b)  "Insurer" includes any company or group of companies under common1785     management, ownership, or control.1786          (c)  "Involved insurer" includes an insurer that either acquires or is acquired, is1787     affiliated with an acquirer or acquired, or is the result of a merger.1788          (d) (i)  "Market" means the relevant product and geographical markets.  In determining1789     the relevant product and geographical markets, the commissioner shall give due consideration1790     to, among other things, the definitions or guidelines, if any, promulgated by the National1791     Association of Insurance Commissioners and to information, if any, submitted by parties to the1792     acquisition.  In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product1793     market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business, such line1794     being that used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this1795     state, and the relevant geographical market is assumed to be this state.1796          (ii)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1)(d)(i), for purposes of Subsection (2)(b), "market"1797     means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the1798     annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state.1799          (2) (a)  This section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of1800     an insurer authorized to do business in Utah.1801          (b)  This section does not apply to the following:1802          (i)  securities purchased solely for investment purposes so long as the securities are not1803     used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of1804     competition in any insurance market in this state;1805          (ii)  if a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under Subsection1806     31A-1-301(29)(d), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the commissioner of the1807     insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control1808     does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the1809     domiciliary commissioner to the commissioner of this state;1810          (iii)  the acquisition of a person by another person when both persons are neither1811     directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if pre-acquisition1812     notification is filed with the commissioner in accordance with Subsection (3)(a) 30 days before1813     the proposed effective date of the acquisition;1814          (iv)  the acquisition of an already affiliated person;1815          (v)  an acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition:1816          (A)  in no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed 5%1817     of the total market;1818          (B)  there would be no increase in any market share; or1819          (C)  in no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceeds1820     12% of the total market, and the market share increase by more than 2% of the total market;1821          (vi)  an acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required pursuant1822     to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business;1823     or1824          (vii)  an acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary commissioner affirmatively finds1825     that the insurer is in failing condition, and:1826          (A)  there is a lack of feasible alternative to improving such condition;1827          (B)  the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition1828     exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and1829          (C)  the findings are communicated by the domiciliary commissioner to the1830     commissioner of this state.1831          (3)  An acquisition covered by Subsection (2) may be subject to an order pursuant to1832     Subsection (5) unless the acquiring person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting1833     period has expired.  The acquired person may file a pre-acquisition notification.  The1834     commissioner shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this Subsection1835     (3) in the same manner as provided in Section 31A-16-109.1836          (a)  The pre-acquisition notification shall be in the form and contain such information1837     as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those1838     markets that, under Subsection (2)(b)(v), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from this1839     section.  The commissioner may require additional material and information as considered1840     necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the1841     competitive standard of Subsection (4).  The required information may include an opinion of an1842     economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a1843     summary of the education and experience of the economist indicating the economist's ability to1844     render an informed opinion.1845          (b)  The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the commissioner1846     of a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the 30th day after the date of1847     receipt, or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.  Before the end of the1848     waiting period, the commissioner on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional1849     needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period1850     shall end on the earlier of the 30th day after receipt of the additional information by the1851     commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner.1852          (4) (a)  The commissioner may enter an order under Subsection (5)(a) with respect to an1853     acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially1854     to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state, tend to create a monopoly, or if the1855     insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with this section.1856          (b)  In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive1857     standard of Subsection (4)(a), the commissioner shall consider the following:1858          (i)  Any acquisition covered under this Subsection (4) involving two or more insurers1859     competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards1860     if:1861          (A)  the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following1862     shares of the market:1863      Insurer A Insurer B1864      4% 4% or more1865      10% 2% or more 1866      15% 1% or more; or1867          (B)  the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the1868     following shares of the market:1869      Insurer A Insurer B1870      5% 5% or more1871      10% 4% or more 1872      15% 3% or more1873      19% 1% or more.1874          (ii)  For purposes of this section, a highly concentrated market is one in which the share1875     of the four largest insurers is 75% or more of the market.  Percentages not shown in the tables1876     are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown.  If more than two insurers1877     are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of1878     violation of the competitive standard in Subsection (4)(a).1879          (iii)  For purposes of this section, the insurer with the largest share of the market shall1880     be considered to be Insurer A.1881          (c)  There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate1882     market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the1883     eight largest, has increased by 7% or more of the market over a period of time extending from1884     any base year 5 to 10 years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition.  Any1885     acquisition or merger covered under Subsection (1) involving two or more insurers competing1886     in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in1887     Subsection (4)(a) if:1888          (i)  there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market;1889          (ii)  one of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers1890     showing the requisite increase in the market share; and1891          (iii)  another involved insurer's market is 2% or more.1892          (d)  The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive1893     standard rests upon the commissioner.1894          (e)  Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard1895     under Subsections (4)(b) and (4)(c), the commissioner may establish the requisite1896     anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence.1897          (f)  Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard1898     under Subsections (4)(b) and (4)(c), a party may establish the absence of the requisite1899     anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence.  Relevant factors in making a1900     determination under this Subsection (4)(f) include the following:1901          (i)  market shares;1902          (ii)  volatility of ranking of market leaders;1903          (iii)  number of competitors;1904          (iv)  concentration or trend of concentration in the industry; and1905          (v)  ease of entry and exit into the market.1906          (g)  An order may not be entered under Subsection (5) if:1907          (i)  the acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource1908     use that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way, and the public benefits that would arise1909     from the economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition;1910     or1911          (ii)  the acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance, and the1912     public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening1913     competition.1914          (5) (a)  Subject to Title 63G, Chapter 4, Administrative Procedures Act, if an1915     acquisition violates the standards of this section, the commissioner may enter an order:1916          (i)  requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state1917     with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation; or1918          (ii)  denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do1919     business in this state.1920          (b)  The commissioner shall accompany an order issued under this Subsection (5) with1921     a written decision of the commissioner setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law.1922          (c)  An order pursuant to this section may not apply if the acquisition is not1923     consummated.1924          (d)  A person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under1925     Subsection (5)(a)(i) and while the order is in effect may after notice and hearing and upon order1926     of the commissioner be subject at the discretion of the commissioner to one or more of the1927     following:1928          (i)  notwithstanding Section 31A-2-308, a monetary penalty of not more than $10,0001929     for every day of violation; or1930          (ii)  suspension or revocation of the person's license.1931          (e)  An insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section, and1932     who fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with a filing requirement, is subject to a1933     fine of not more than $50,000 notwithstanding Section 31A-2-308.1934          Section 6.  Section 31A-16-105 is amended to read:1935          31A-16-105. Registration of insurers.1936          (1) (a)  [Every] An insurer [which] that is authorized to do business in this state and1937     [which] that is a member of an insurance holding company system shall register with the1938     commissioner, except a foreign insurer subject to registration requirements and standards1939     adopted by statute or regulation in the jurisdiction of its domicile, if the requirements and1940     standards are substantially similar to those contained in this section, Subsections1941     31A-16-106(1)(a) and (2) and either Subsection 31A-16-106(1)(b) or a statutory provision1942     similar to the following: "Each registered insurer shall keep current the information required to1943     be disclosed in its registration statement by reporting all material changes or additions within1944     15 days after the end of the month in which it learns of each change or addition."1945          (b)  [Any] An insurer [which] that is subject to registration under this section shall1946     register within 15 days after it becomes subject to registration, and annually thereafter by May1947     1 of each year for the previous calendar year, unless the commissioner for good cause extends1948     the time for registration and then at the end of the extended time period.  The commissioner1949     may require any insurer authorized to do business in the state, which is a member of a holding1950     company system, and which is not subject to registration under this section, to furnish a copy of1951     the registration statement, the summary specified in Subsection (3), or any other information1952     filed by the insurer with the insurance regulatory authority of domiciliary jurisdiction.1953          (2)  [Every] An insurer subject to registration shall file the registration statement with1954     the commissioner on a form and in a format prescribed by the National Association of1955     Insurance Commissioners, which shall contain the following current information:1956          (a)  the capital structure, general financial condition, and ownership and management of1957     the insurer and any person controlling the insurer;1958          (b)  the identity and relationship of every member of the insurance holding company1959     system;1960          (c)  any of the following agreements in force, and transactions currently outstanding or1961     which have occurred during the last calendar year between the insurer and its affiliates:1962          (i)  loans, other investments, or purchases, sales or exchanges of securities of the1963     affiliates by the insurer or of securities of the insurer by its affiliates;1964          (ii)  purchases, sales, or exchanges of assets;1965          (iii)  transactions not in the ordinary course of business;1966          (iv)  guarantees or undertakings for the benefit of an affiliate which result in an actual1967     contingent exposure of the insurer's assets to liability, other than insurance contracts entered1968     into in the ordinary course of the insurer's business;1969          (v)  all management agreements, service contracts, and all cost-sharing arrangements;1970          (vi)  reinsurance agreements;1971          (vii)  dividends and other distributions to shareholders; and1972          (viii)  consolidated tax allocation agreements;1973          (d)  any pledge of the insurer's stock, including stock of any subsidiary or controlling1974     affiliate, for a loan made to any member of the insurance holding company system; [and]1975          (e)  if requested by the commissioner, financial statements of or within an insurance1976     holding company system, including all affiliates:1977          (i)  which may include annual audited financial statements filed with the United States1978     Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or1979     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and1980          (ii)  which request is satisfied by providing the commissioner with the most recently1981     filed parent corporation financial statements that have been filed with the United States1982     Securities and Exchange Commission;1983          [(e)] (f)  any other matters concerning transactions between registered insurers and any1984     affiliates as may be included in any subsequent registration forms adopted or approved by the1985     commissioner[.];1986          (g)  statements that the insurer's board of directors oversees corporate governance and1987     internal controls and that the insurer's officers or senior management have approved,1988     implemented, and continue to maintain and monitor corporate governance and internal control1989     procedures; and1990          (h)  any other information required by rule made by the commissioner in accordance1991     with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.1992          (3)  All registration statements shall contain a summary outlining all items in the1993     current registration statement representing changes from the prior registration statement.1994          (4)  No information need be disclosed on the registration statement filed pursuant to1995     Subsection (2) if the information is not material for the purposes of this section.  Unless the1996     commissioner by rule or order provides otherwise, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans or1997     extensions of credit, investments, or guarantees involving one-half of 1%, or less, of an1998     insurer's admitted assets as of the next preceding December 31 may not be considered material1999     for purposes of this section.2000          (5)  Subject to Section 31A-16-106, each registered insurer shall report to the2001     commissioner a dividend or other distribution to shareholders within 15 business days2002     following the declaration of the dividend or distribution.2003          [(5)] (6)  Any person within an insurance holding company system subject to2004     registration shall provide complete and accurate information to an insurer if the information is2005     reasonably necessary to enable the insurer to comply with the provisions of this chapter.2006          [(6)] (7)  The commissioner shall terminate the registration of any insurer which2007     demonstrates that it no longer is a member of an insurance holding company system.2008          [(7)] (8)  The commissioner may require or allow two or more affiliated insurers subject2009     to registration under this section to file a consolidated registration statement.2010          [(8)] (9)  The commissioner may allow an insurer which is authorized to do business in2011     this state, and which is part of an insurance holding company system, to register on behalf of2012     any affiliated insurer which is required to register under Subsection (1) and to file all2013     information and material required to be filed under this section.2014          [(9)  The provisions of this] (10)  This section [do] does not apply to any insurer,2015     information, or transaction if, and to the extent that, the commissioner by rule or order exempts2016     the insurer from [the provisions of] this section.2017          [(10)] (11)  Any person may file with the commissioner a disclaimer of affiliation with2018     any authorized insurer, or a disclaimer of affiliation may be filed by any insurer or any member2019     of an insurance holding company system.

The commissioner2024     shall disallow a disclaimer only after furnishing all parties in interest with notice and2025     opportunity to be heard, and after making specific findings of fact to support the disallowance.]2026     A disclaimer of affiliation is considered to have been granted unless the commissioner, within2027     30 days following receipt of a complete disclaimer, notifies the filing party the disclaimer is2028     disallowed.  If disallowed, the disclaiming party may request an administrative hearing, which2029     shall be granted.  The disclaiming party shall be relieved of its duty to register under this2030     section if approval of the disclaimer is granted by the commissioner, or if the disclaimer is2031     considered to have been approved.2032          (12)  The ultimate controlling person of an insurer subject to registration shall also file2033     an annual enterprise risk report.  The annual enterprise risk report shall, to the best of the2034     ultimate controlling person's knowledge and belief, identify the material risks within the2035     insurance holding company that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer.

If the commissioner determines that the2122     separate transactions were entered into over any 12 month period for such a purpose, [he] the2123     commissioner may exercise [his] the commissioner's authority under Section 31A-16-110.2124          (d)  The commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to Subsection (1)(b), shall2125     consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in Subsection (1)(a) and2126     whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.2127          (e)  The commissioner shall be notified within 30 days of any investment of the2128     domestic insurer in any one corporation, if the total investment in the corporation by the2129     insurance holding company system exceeds 10% of the corporation's voting securities.2130          (2) (a)  A domestic insurer may not pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other2131     extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:2132          (i)  30 days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration of the2133     dividend and has not within the 30-day period disapproved the payment; or2134          (ii)  the commissioner has approved the payment within the 30-day period.2135          (b)  For purposes of this [subsection] Subsection (2), an extraordinary dividend or2136     distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, fair market value of2137     which, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 122138     months, exceeds the lesser of:2139          (i)  10% of the insurer's surplus held for policyholders as of the next preceding2140     December 31; [or]2141          (ii)  the net gain from operations of the insurer, if the insurer is a life insurer, or the net2142     income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the 12-month2143     period ending the next preceding December 31; or2144          (iii)  an extraordinary dividend does not include pro rata distributions of any class of the2145     insurer's own securities.2146          (c)  In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other2147     than a life insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has2148     not already been paid out as dividends.  This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net2149     income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital2150     gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.2151          (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an insurer may declare an2152     extraordinary dividend or distribution, which is conditioned upon the commissioner's approval2153     of the dividend or distribution, and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders2154     until:2155          (i)  the commissioner has approved the payment of the dividend or distribution; or2156          (ii)  the commissioner has not disapproved the payment within the 30-day period2157     referred to in Subsection (2)(a).2158          (3) (a)  Notwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers2159     and directors of the insurer may not be relieved of any obligation or liability to which they2160     would otherwise be subject by law, and the insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate2161     operating identity consistent with this chapter.2162          (b)  Nothing in this section precludes a domestic insurer from having or sharing a2163     common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or2164     more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of Subsection (1)(a).2165          (c) (i)  Not less than one-third of the directors of a domestic insurer, and not less than2166     one-third of the members of each committee of the board of directors of a domestic insurer,2167     shall be persons who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity controlling,2168     controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial owners of a2169     controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or entity.2170          (ii)  At least one person described in Subsection (3)(c)(i) shall be included in a quorum2171     for the transaction of business at a meeting of the board of directors or a committee of the2172     board of directors.2173          (d)  The board of directors of a domestic insurer shall establish one or more committees2174     composed solely of directors who are not officers or employees of the insurer or of any entity2175     controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the insurer and who are not beneficial2176     owners of a controlling interest in the voting stock of the insurer or any such entity.

An insurer may also make application to the2189     commissioner for a waiver from the requirements of this Subsection (3) based upon unique2190     circumstances.  The commissioner may consider various factors, including:2191          (i)  the type of business entity;2192          (ii)  the volume of business written;2193          (iii)  the availability of qualified board members; or2194          (iv)  the ownership or organizational structure of the entity.2195          (4) (a)  For purposes of this chapter, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as2196     regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and2197     adequate to meet its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:2198          (i)  the size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves,2199     premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;2200          (ii)  the extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among several lines of2201     insurance;2202          (iii)  the number and size of risks insured in each line of business;2203          (iv)  the extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;2204          (v)  the nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;2205          (vi)  the quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;2206          (vii)  the recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment2207     portfolio;2208          (viii)  the surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;2209          (ix)  the adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and2210          (x)  the quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates.2211          (b)  The commissioner may treat an investment described in Subsection (4)(a)(x) as a2212     disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders2213     whenever in the judgment of the commissioner the investment so warrants.2214          Section 8.  Section 31A-16-107.5, which is renumbered from Section 31A-16-108 is2215     renumbered and amended to read:2216          [31A-16-108].      31A-16-107.5.
