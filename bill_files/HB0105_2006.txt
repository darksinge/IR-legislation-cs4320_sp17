29

30

    
an A rating in the United States Pharmacopeia and Drug Index.

    (b)  "Legend drug" means any drug that requires a prescription under state or federal

35

    
approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.
            
36

    
    (2)  A practitioner may prescribe legend drugs in accordance with this chapter that, in
            
37

    
his professional judgment and within the lawful scope of his practice, he considers appropriate
            
38

39

    
    (3)  Except as provided in Subsection (4), the Department of Health may not maintain a

47
