     62A-11-306.2, Utah Code Annotated 1953
            
28

    

            
29

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

            
30


    
    Section 1.  
Section  
62A-11-306.2

 is enacted to read:
            
31

    
     62A-11-306.2.  Mandatory review and adjustment of child support orders for
            
32

    
 TANF recipients.
            
33

    
    If a child support order has not been issued, adjusted, or modified within the previous
            
34

    
three years and the children who are the subject of the order currently receive TANF funds, the
            
35

    
office shall review the order, and if appropriate, move the tribunal to adjust the amount of the
            
36

    
order if there is a difference of 10% or more between the payor's ordered support amount and
            
37

    
the payor's support amount required under the guidelines.
            
38

    
    Section 2.  
Section  
78-45-7.2

 is amended to read:
            
39

    
     78-45-7.2.  Application of guidelines -- Rebuttal.
            
40

    
    (1)  The guidelines apply to any judicial or administrative order establishing or
            
41

    
modifying an award of child support entered on or after July 1, 1989.
            
42

    
    (2) (a)  The child support guidelines shall be applied as a rebuttable presumption in
            
43

    
establishing or modifying the amount of temporary or permanent child support.
            
44

    
    (b)  The rebuttable presumption means the provisions and considerations required by
            
45

    
the guidelines, the award amounts resulting from the application of the guidelines, and the use
            
46

    
of worksheets consistent with these guidelines are presumed to be correct, unless rebutted
            
47

    
under the provisions of this section.
            
48

    
    (3)  A written finding or specific finding on the record supporting the conclusion that
            
49

    
complying with a provision of the guidelines or ordering an award amount resulting from use
            
50

    
of the guidelines would be unjust, inappropriate, or not in the best interest of a child in a
            
51

    
particular case is sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case.  If an order rebuts the
            
52

    
presumption through findings, it is considered a deviated order.
            
53

    
    (4)  The following shall be considered deviations from the guidelines, if:
            
54

    
    (a)  the order includes a written finding that it is a nonguidelines order;
            
55

    
    (b)  the guidelines worksheet has the box checked for a deviation and has an
            
56

    
explanation as to the reason; or
            
57

    
    (c)  the deviation was made because there were more children than provided for in the

            
58


    
guidelines table.
            
59

    
    (5)  If the amount in the order and the amount on the guidelines worksheet differ, but
            
60

    
the difference is less than $10, the order shall not be considered deviated and the incomes listed
            
61

    
on the worksheet may be used in adjusting support for emancipation.
            
62

    
    (6) (a)  Natural or adoptive children of either parent who live in the home of that parent
            
63

    
and are not children in common to both parties may at the option of either party be taken into
            
64

    
account under the guidelines in setting or modifying a child support award, as provided in
            
65

    
Subsection (7).  Credit may not be given if:
            
66

    
    (i)  by giving credit to the obligor, children for whom a prior support order exists would
            
67

    
have their child support reduced; or
            
68

    
    (ii)  by giving credit to the obligee for a present family, the obligation of the obligor
            
69

    
would increase.
            
70

    
    (b)  Additional worksheets shall be prepared that compute the obligations of the
            
71

    
respective parents for the additional children.  The obligations shall then be subtracted from the
            
72

    
appropriate parent's income before determining the award in the instant case.
            
73

    
    (7)  In a proceeding to adjust or modify an existing award, consideration of natural or
            
74

    
adoptive children born after entry of the order and who are not in common to both parties may
            
75

    
be applied to mitigate an increase in the award but may not be applied:
            
76

    
    (a)  for the benefit of the obligee if the credit would increase the support obligation of
            
77

    
the obligor from the most recent order; or
            
78

    
    (b)  for the benefit of the obligor if the amount of support received by the obligee would
            
79

    
be decreased from the most recent order.
            
80

    
    (8) (a)  If a child support order has not been issued or modified within the previous
            
81

    
three years, a parent, legal guardian, or the office may [petition] move the court to adjust the
            
82

    
amount of a child support order.
            
83

    
    (b)  Upon receiving a [petition] motion under Subsection (8)(a), the court shall, taking
            
84

    
into account the best interests of the child, determine whether there is a difference between the
            
85

    
amount ordered and the amount that would be required under the guidelines.  If there is a

            
86


    
difference of 10% or more and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the court shall adjust
            
87

    
the amount to that which is provided for in the guidelines.
            
88

    
    (c)  A showing of a substantial change in circumstances is not necessary for an
            
89

    
adjustment under Subsection (8)(b).
            
90

    
    (9) (a)  A parent, legal guardian, or the office may at any time petition the court to
            
91

    
adjust the amount of a child support order if there has been a substantial change in
            
92

    
circumstances.
            
93

    
    (b)  For purposes of Subsection (9)(a), a substantial change in circumstances may
            
94

    
include:
            
95

    
    (i)  material changes in custody;
            
96

    
    (ii)  material changes in the relative wealth or assets of the parties;
            
97

    
    (iii)  material changes of 30% or more in the income of a parent;
            
98

    
    (iv)  material changes in the ability of a parent to earn;
            
99

    
    (v)  material changes in the medical needs of the child; and
            
100

    
    (vi)  material changes in the legal responsibilities of either parent for the support of
            
101

    
others.
            
102

    
    (c)  Upon receiving a petition under Subsection (9)(a), the court shall, taking into
            
103

    
account the best interests of the child, determine whether a substantial change has occurred.  If
            
104

    
it has, the court shall then determine whether the change results in a difference of 15% or more
            
105

    
between the amount of child support ordered and the amount that would be required under the
            
106

    
guidelines.  If there is such a difference and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the
            
107

    
court shall adjust the amount of child support ordered to that which is provided for in the
            
108

    
guidelines.
            
109

    
    (10)  Notice of the opportunity to adjust a support order under Subsections (8) and (9)
            
110

    
shall be included in each child support order issued or modified after July 1, 1997.
