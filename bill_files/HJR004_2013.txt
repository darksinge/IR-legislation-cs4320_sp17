 LONG TITLE
            
8

    
 Committee Note:
            
9

    
    The Revenue and Taxation Interim Committee recommended this bill.
            
10

    
 General Description:
            
11

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature urges the United States Congress to require all
            
12

    
retailers whose sales to consumers in the state exceed a minimum threshold to collect
            
13

    
applicable sales taxes on the sales in the state.
            
14

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
15

    
    This resolution:
            
16

    
    .    urges the United States Congress to act to authorize states, subject to the enactment
            
17

    
of any necessary state laws, to require all retailers whose sales to consumers in the
            
18

    
state exceed a minimum threshold to collect applicable sales taxes on the sales in
            
19

    
the state.
            
20

    
 Special Clauses:
            
21

    
    None
            
22

    

            
23

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
24

    
    WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Quill v. North Dakota, 504
            
25

    
U.S. 298 (1992) that the "dormant" or "negative" Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the
            
26

    
United States prohibits a state from requiring a retailer to collect and remit sales tax on sales to
            
27

    
consumers in the state unless the retailer has physical presence in the state;

            
28


    
    WHEREAS, the Supreme Court further held "that the underlying issue is not only one
            
29

    
that Congress may be better qualified to resolve, but also one that Congress has the ultimate
            
30

    
power to resolve"; 
            
31

    
    WHEREAS, the sales tax, as applied to consumer purchases, can be a transparent tax
            
32

    
levied by state and local governments; 
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, the sales tax is, from the individual consumer's perspective, one of the
            
34

    
simplest taxes imposed by state and local governments; 
            
35

    
    WHEREAS, a complex aspect of sales taxation, from the individual consumer's
            
36

    
perspective, is the requirement to pay "use" tax directly to the state or locality when sales tax is
            
37

    
not collected by the retailer; 
            
38

    
    WHEREAS, the electronic commerce industry needs to be left free from government
            
39

    
interference, and any argument in favor of taxing sales on the Internet is problematic in light of
            
40

    
constitutional provisions regarding interstate commerce and interstate compacts; 
            
41

    
    WHEREAS, because there are over 9,600 state and local taxing jurisdictions in the
            
42

    
United States, each with unique and changing definitions, rules, and holidays, the sales tax is,
            
43

    
from a remote seller's perspective, one of the most complex and costly taxes imposed by state
            
44

    
and local governments;
            
45

    
    WHEREAS, less than half of the states have worked to make it simpler or less costly
            
46

    
for retailers that collect and remit sales taxes in multiple states, and the largest states have not
            
47

    
participated in simplification or cost reduction; 
            
48

    
    WHEREAS, the sales tax is frequently both a state and local tax; 
            
49

    
    WHEREAS, remote collection of the sales tax may help to strengthen state and local
            
50

    
tax systems; 
            
51

    
    WHEREAS, consumption taxes can be used to achieve competitiveness; 
            
52

    
    WHEREAS, the sales tax has been a stable source of state and local revenue and
            
53

    
provides some level of certainty for states and localities; 
            
54

    
    WHEREAS, some proposed federal legislation authorizing states to require all retailers
            
55

    
whose sales to consumers in those states exceed a minimum threshold to collect sales taxes has
            
56

    
garnered support from some businesses and organizations;
            
57

    
    WHEREAS, some of this federal legislation would allow states to improve the
            
58

    
collection of legally owed taxes and thus provide flexibility to lower tax rates for all taxpayers; 

            
59


    
    WHEREAS, despite the progress states have made in simplifying state sales tax
            
60

    
collection for remote sellers, there remain some inequities between the burden of tax collection
            
61

    
obligations imposed upon sellers with physical presence and the burdens those same
            
62

    
obligations would impose on remote sellers serving consumers in multiple states without
            
63

    
physical presence;
            
64

    
    WHEREAS, any federal legislation should be fair to both in-state and remote sellers,
            
65

    
whether such legislation requires sales and use taxes to be collected on a point-of-sale or
            
66

    
point-of-delivery basis; and 
            
67

    
    WHEREAS, Congress, in considering federal legislation, should at least consider the
            
68

    
following principles in the enactment of such federal legislation that would permit states to
            
69

    
impose sales tax obligations on remote sellers: 
            
70

    
    1.  State-provided or state-certified tax collection and remittance software that is simple
            
71

    
to implement and maintain;
            
72

    
    2.  Immunity from civil lawsuits for retailers utilizing state-provided or state-certified
            
73

    
software in tax collection and remittance;
            
74

    
    3.  Tax audit accountability to a single state tax audit authority;
            
75

    
    4.  Elimination of interstate tax complexity by streamlining taxable good categories;
            
76

    
    5.  Adoption of a meaningful small business exception so that small, remote seller
            
77

    
businesses are not adversely affected; and
            
78

    
    6.  Fair compensation to the tax-collecting retailer, taking into account such elements as
            
79

    
the exchange fees retailers are charged for consumer credit card transactions, which fees apply
            
80

    
equally to any state taxes collected on the purchase of goods sold as well as the actual purchase
            
81

    
amount:
            
82

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
83

    
urges Congress to enact legislation to authorize states, consistent with this resolution and
            
84

    
principles of taxation espoused by national associations of legislators and governors, and
            
85

    
subject to the enactment of any necessary state laws, to establish true fairness in state tax
            
86

    
collection for both retailers having physical presence in a state and retailers who are remote
            
87

    
sellers.
            
88

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah, having
            
89

    
addressed the principles of fairness outlined in this resolution, urges Congress to require all

            
90


    
retailers whose sales to consumers exceed a minimum threshold to collect and remit applicable
            
91

    
sales taxes on sales in the state.
            
92

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the members of
            
93

    
the United States House of Representatives and to the members of the United States Senate.
