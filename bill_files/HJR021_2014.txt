 LONG TITLE
            
9

    
 General Description:
            
10

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature strongly urges the United States Congress to
            
11

    
fully and permanently fund Payment In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) and transfer to the state of
            
12

    
Utah the federally controlled public lands within the state.
            
13

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
14

    
    This resolution:
            
15

    
    .    urges and directs the United States Congress to use every exertion in its power, by
            
16

    
reason, argument, and persuasion, to induce the United States to fully fund, on a
            
17

    
perpetual and mandatory basis, Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT), which the state
            
18

    
and its subdivisions would otherwise collect if the federal government honored the
            
19

    
same statehood enabling act terms that it honored with all states east of Colorado;
            
20

    
and
            
21

    
    .    demands, if Congress cannot or will not fully fund PILT at the full assessed value of
            
22

    
similarly situated lands within Utah's counties on a mandatory, permanent, and
            
23

    
perpetual basis, that Congress transfer title to the public lands, as was done
            
24

    
previously for similarly impacted states east of Colorado, directly to the state of
            
25

    
Utah so that Utah and its subdivisions can generate tax and other revenues from
            
26

    
these lands to fund education, police, fire, sanitation, social welfare, and other
            
27

    
essential public services.

            
28


    
 Special Clauses:
            
29

    
    None
            
30

    

            
31

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
32

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Congress elected to not fund the Payment In Lieu of
            
33

    
Taxes (PILT) Act in its most recent $1.1 trillion Omnibus Spending Bill of 2014;
            
34

    
    WHEREAS, Congress instead included funding for its PILT obligations for only one
            
35

    
year in the Farm Bill of 2014;
            
36

    
    WHEREAS, PILT was imposed by Congress in 1976 to compensate states for the loss
            
37

    
of tax and other revenues that states would generate if Congress had honored its nearly
            
38

    

200-year-old


 obligation to transfer title to the public lands;
            
39

    
    WHEREAS, Congress originally promised that PILT would be mandatory and
            
40

    
perpetual because it was intentionally imposed as a substitute for what the congressional
            
41

    
Committee on the Public Lands referred to in 1828 as "a power incident to all sovereign states
            
42

    
of taxing the soil to confer benefits";
            
43

    
    WHEREAS, in 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy Management Act of
            
44

    
1976, or FLPMA, which unilaterally changed the obligation of the federal government to
            
45

    
transfer title to the public lands in favor of a policy to "forever retain public lands in federal
            
46

    
ownership";
            
47

    
    WHEREAS, as a palliative to the affected states for usurping this "power incident to all
            
48

    
sovereign states of taxing the soil" through FLPMA, Congress also imposed the new PILT
            
49

    
program;
            
50

    
    WHEREAS, as a result of the federal government's failure or refusal to transfer title to
            
51

    
the public lands, some counties in Utah have as little as 5% taxable lands to fund education,
            
52

    
police, fire, sanitation, social welfare, and other essential public services;
            
53

    
    WHEREAS, an analysis by the Legislature's Office of Legislative Fiscal Analyst
            
54

    
reveals that the amounts previously funded by Congress as PILT to Utah counties amounts only
            
55

    
to approximately 13 cents on the dollar of the average taxable value for similarly situated
            
56

    
lands;
            
57

    
    WHEREAS, PILT more accurately represents "Pennies In Lieu of Trillions," in light of
            
58

    
the fact that the Institute for Energy Research estimated in 2013 that there is more than $150

            
59


    
trillion in mineral value locked up in federally controlled lands;
            
60

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Government Accountability Office estimated in 2012
            
61

    
that there is more recoverable oil in the federally controlled lands in Utah, Colorado, and
            
62

    
Wyoming than the rest of the world combined;
            
63

    
    WHEREAS, as a result of having such a minimal amount of lands subject to taxation or
            
64

    
other revenues because of federal retention of these lands, Utah counties are dependent upon
            
65

    
the promise of PILT for as much as 40% of their total county budgets to fund education, police,
            
66

    
fire, sanitation, social services, and other essential public services;
            
67

    
    WHEREAS, a one-year appropriation for PILT in the Farm Bill of 2014 disregards
            
68

    
entirely the uniquely sovereign character of PILT--putting PILT on par with other line items of
            
69

    
federal expense like funding the study of excess alcohol on prostitutes in China--rather than
            
70

    
honoring PILT as a mandatory and perpetual substitute for the "power incident to all sovereign
            
71

    
states of taxing the soil";
            
72

    
    WHEREAS, a mere one-year PILT appropriation denies state and local governments of
            
73

    
budgetary certainty to meet fundamental public obligations like funding education, police, fire,
            
74

    
sanitation, social welfare, and other essential public services;
            
75

    
    WHEREAS, the federal government has not passed a budget for more than five years,
            
76

    
has accumulated a national debt exceeding $17 trillion, overspends at the rate of nearly $1
            
77

    
trillion a year, has unfunded obligations for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and others in
            
78

    
excess of $87 trillion, and is creating money at the rate of tens of billions of dollars per month;
            
79

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Government Accountability Office regularly declares
            
80

    
that the financial statement of the United States is "unsustainable";
            
81

    
    WHEREAS, history reflects that Congress previously delayed for decades disposing of
            
82

    
as much as 90% of the lands in states such as Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana,
            
83

    
Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, depriving these states of the ability to tax or generate
            
84

    
revenues from their lands;
            
85

    
    WHEREAS, lacking the ability to tax or generate revenues from their lands, the 1828
            
86

    
congressional Committee on the Public Lands indicated "in vain may the People of these States
            
87

    
expect the advantages of well settled neighborhoods, so essential to the education of youth . . .
            
88

    
Those states will, for many generations, without some change, be retarded in endeavors to
            
89

    
increase their comfort and wealth, by means of works of internal improvements, because they

            
90


    
have not the power, incident to all sovereign States, of taxing the soil, to pay for the benefits
            
91

    
conferred upon its owner";
            
92

    
    WHEREAS, upon raising their collective demand to Congress, the congressional
            
93

    
Committee on the Public Lands found with respect to their admission as states that "when these
            
94

    
States stipulated not to tax the lands of the United States until they were sold, they rested upon
            
95

    
the implied engagement of Congress to cause them to be sold, within a reasonable time.  No
            
96

    
just equivalent has been given those States for a surrender of an attribute of sovereignty so
            
97

    
important to their welfare, and to an equal standing with the original States";
            
98

    
    WHEREAS, ultimately, the collective and persistent demands of these states resulted in
            
99

    
the transfer of their public lands by Congress;
            
100

    
    WHEREAS, Congress's obligation to transfer title to the public lands to the states is
            
101

    
included in the Enabling Act for Utah's admission as a state--an agreement the United States
            
102

    
Supreme Court refers to as a "bi-lateral" and "solemn compact";
            
103

    
    WHEREAS, the terms of Utah's Enabling Act, with respect to the transfer of public
            
104

    
lands, are in all material respects similar to the enabling acts of most of the newly created states
            
105

    
east of Colorado and west of the original 13 states; and
            
106

    
    WHEREAS, legal analysis by the Federalist Society concludes that the Enabling Act is
            
107

    
"a compact and promise made between two sovereigns where the federal government
            
108

    
committed itself to disposal and promised that it would exercise its disposal obligations in a
            
109

    
manner (and with an understanding that respects the expectation by the State that the federal
            
110

    
government would dispose of such lands) so that both a percentage of the proceeds from the
            
111

    
sales would be shared with the State and the State thereafter would have the capacity to tax
            
112

    
such lands when disposed . . .":
            
113

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that until the federal government honors the
            
114

    
promise made at statehood to transfer title to the public lands, the Legislature of the state of
            
115

    
Utah urges and directs, in the most strenuous terms within the power of a sovereign and
            
116

    
independent state, that the senators and representatives of the United States Congress use every
            
117

    
exertion in their power, by reason, argument, and persuasion, to induce the United States to
            
118

    
fully fund, on a perpetual and mandatory basis, Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT), which the
            
119

    
state and its subdivisions would otherwise collect if the federal government honored the same
            
120

    
statehood enabling act terms that it honored with all states east of Colorado.

            
121


    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if Congress cannot or will not fully fund PILT at
            
122

    
the full assessed value of similarly situated lands within Utah's counties on a mandatory,
            
123

    
permanent, and perpetual basis, the Legislature of the state of Utah demands that Congress
            
124

    
transfer title to the public lands, as was done previously for similarly impacted states east of
            
125

    
Colorado, directly to the state of Utah so that Utah and its subdivisions can generate tax and
            
126

    
other revenues from these lands to fund education, police, fire, sanitation, social welfare, and
            
127

    
other essential public services.
            
128

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Majority
            
129

    
Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives,
            
130

    
the United States Department of the Interior, and the members of Utah's congressional
            
131

    
delegation.
