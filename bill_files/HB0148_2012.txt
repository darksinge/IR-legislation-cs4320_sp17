 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-14-12  12:40 PM

 As required by legislative rules and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General
Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its
own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The note is based on an analysis of
relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill. The note is not written for the
purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide
information relevant to legislators' consideration of this bill. The note is not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a law in the
context of a specific case. 

This bill enacts the Transfer of Public Lands Act, which requires the United States to

extinguish title to public lands and transfer title to public lands to the state on or before
December 31, 2014. 
If challenged, this bill raises questions of who has the right to dispose of and possess the land
held by the United States.

The "Property Clause" of the Constitution of the United States authorizes Congress "to dispose
of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property
belonging to the United States . . ." U.S. Const. art. IV, sec. 3, cl. 2. The Supreme Court of the
United States has held that "Congress has the same power over [territory] as over any other
property belonging to the United States; and this power is vested in Congress without
limitation . . ." United States v. Gratiot, 39 U.S. 526, 537 (1840). See also Kleppe v. New
Mexico, 426 U.S. 529, 539 (1976). Pursuant to its broad authority under the Property Clause,
Congress may enact legislation to manage or sell federal land, and any legislation Congress
enacts "necessarily overrides conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause." Kleppe, 426
U.S. at 543. See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that "[w]ith respect to the public domain, the
Constitution vests in Congress the power of disposition and of making all needful rules and
regulations.  That power is subject to no limitations.  Congress has the absolute right to
prescribe the times, the conditions, and the mode of transferring this property, or any part of it,
and to designate the persons to whom the transfer shall be made.  No State legislation can
interfere with this right or embarrass its exercise; and to prevent the possibility of any
attempted interference with it, a provision has been usually inserted in the compacts by which
new States have been admitted to the Union, that such interference with the primary disposal of
the soil of the United States shall never be made." Gibson v. Chouteau, 80 U.S. 92 (1872).

The Transfer of Public Lands Act requires that the United States extinguish title to public lands
and transfer title to those public lands to Utah by a date certain.  Under the Gibson case, that
requirement would interfere with Congress' power to dispose of public lands.  Thus, that
requirement, and any attempt by Utah in the future to enforce the requirement, have a high
probability of being declared unconstitutional.
