Snow                             This act modifies provisions relating to public utilities by enacting provisions relating to net                          metering.  This act requires electrical corporations to make a net metering program                          available to customers by which customers may establish an inverter controlled customer                          generation system to produce electricity for their own use and to supply excess electricity to                          the electrical corporation.  The act requires the electrical corporation to offset charges for                           electricity by the amount of electricity supplied by a customer from a customer generation                           system and requires the electrical corporation to give the customer a credit for electricity                           generated by the customer that exceeds the amount supplied by the electrical corporation.                            The act requires the customer to meet certain safety and other requirements with respect to                           a customer generation system.  The act prohibits the electrical corporation from imposing                           additional charges or fees to customers participating in a net metering program unless                           authorized.
