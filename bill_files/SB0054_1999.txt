shall consider the impact on existing services, including the impact on response times, call volumes,
            

    
populations and exclusive geographic service areas served, and the ability of surrounding licensed

- 26 -

            

    
providers to service their exclusive geographic service areas.  The issuance or amendment of a
            

    
license may not create an orphaned area.
            

    
    (3)  The quality of service in the area must be maintained or improved.  The officer shall
            

    
consider the:
            

    
    (a)  staffing and equipment standards of the current licensed provider and the applicant;

staff;

provide service to the public.
            

    
    (4)  The cost to the public must be justified.  The officer must consider:
            

    
    (a)  the financial solvency of the applicant;
            

    
    (b)  the applicant's ability to provide services within the rates established under Section
            

    


26-8a-403

;
            

    
    (c)  the applicant's ability to comply with cost reporting requirements;
            

    
    (d)  the cost efficiency of the applicant; and
            

    
    (e)  the cost effect of the application on the public, interested parties, and the emergency
            

    
medical services system.
            

    
    (5)  Local desires concerning cost, quality, and access must be considered.  The officer shall
            

    
assess and consider:
            

    
    (a)  the existing provider's record of providing services and the applicant's record and ability
            

    
to provide similar or improved services;
            

    
    (b)  locally established emergency medical services goals, including those established in
            

    
Subsection (7);
            

    
    (c)  comment by local governments on the applicant's business and operations plans;
            

    
    (d)  comment by interested parties that are providers on the impact of the application on the

- 27 -

            

    
parties' ability to provide emergency medical services;
            

    
    (e)  comment by interested parties that are local governments on the impact of the application
            

    
on the citizens it represents; and
            

    
    (f)  public comment on any aspect of the application or proposed license.
            

    
    (6)  Other related criteria:
            

    
    (a)  the officer considers necessary; or
            

    
    (b)   established by department rule.
            

    
    (7)  The role of local governments in the licensing of ground ambulance and paramedic
            

    
providers that serve areas also served by the local governments is important.  The Legislature
            

    
strongly encourages local governments to establish cost, quality, and access goals for the ground
            

    
ambulance and paramedic services that serve their areas.
            

    
    (8)  In a formal adjudicative proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that
            

    
public convenience and necessity require the approval of the application for all or part of the
            

    
exclusive geographic service area requested.
