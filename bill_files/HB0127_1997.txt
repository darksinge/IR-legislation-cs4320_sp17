Section            is enacted to read           CHAPTER   .  ELECTRICAL FACILITY REVIEW BOARD ACT           Part  .  General Provisions                        .  Short title.              This chapter is known as the  Electrical Facility Review Board Act.               Section  .  Section            is enacted to read                         .  Legislative findings.                   The Legislature finds that the construction of transmission lines and substations by          electrical corporations that are public utilities under this title is a matter of statewide concern.  The          construction of these facilities may affect the safety, reliability, adequacy, and efficiency of service          to customers in areas within the jurisdiction of more than a single local government.  Excess costs          imposed by requirements of a local government for the construction of facilities may affect either          the rates and charges of the public utility to customers other than customers within the jurisdiction          of the local government or the financial viability of the public utility, unless the local government          pays for those excess costs.                   The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to establish the Electrical Facility          Review Board to resolve issues regarding the construction and installation of transmission lines          and substations by any electrical corporation that is a public utility.

Board  means the Electrical Facility Review Board.

Estimated excess cost  means any material difference in estimated cost between the         costs of a facility, including any necessary right of way, if constructed in accordance with the         requirements of a local government and the standard cost of the facility.

If the local government requests the public utility to obtain competitive bids, the public         utility shall obtain competitive bids, and the actual excess cost of the facility shall be the difference         between the lowest bid acceptable to the public utility plus the public utility s contract         administration and oversight expense and the standard cost of the facility.

The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review any decision of the board in a formal          adjudicative proceeding.              Section   .   Effective date.              This act takes effect on July  ,     .               Legislative Review Note      as of                  PM    This bill raises the following constitutional or statutory  concerns    Article VI, Section   , of the Utah Constitution, prohibits the legislative delegation of certain  municipal functions to a special commission.  To determine whether a particular activity is a  municipal function, the Utah Supreme Court has applied a three prong balancing test consisting  of the following factors    i  the degree to which the function in question  affects the interests of  those beyond the boundaries of the municipality    ii  the  relative abilities of the state and  municipal governments to perform the function   and  iii   the extent to which the legislation  under attack will intrude upon the ability of the people within the municipality to control through  their elected officials the substantive policies that affect them uniquely.       In this bill, the Electric Facility Review Board is created to resolve certain disputes between local  governments and electric utilities regarding the siting of transmission lines or substations.  The  board is empowered to decide whether a transmission line or substation should be constructed and,  if so, whether any requirements or conditions imposed by the local government may not be  imposed because they impair the ability of the public utility to provide safe, reliable, and adequate  service to its customers. If the board determines that a transmission line or substation that a local  government has prohibited should be constructed, the board must specify any general location  parameters required to provide safe, reliable, adequate, and efficient service to the customers of  the public utility.  The bill reserves all other siting issues to the local government and allows a  local government to require or condition approval of a facility in a manner that imposes excess  costs so long as the local government pays the excess costs.    In recent years the courts have given much deference to the state in this area of legislation and in  the majority of such cases  have determined that there is no violation of the Constitution.   However, aside from the balancing test, the courts have not established clear guidelines as to what  constitutes a  special commission  or what activities constitute  municipal functions  in every  situation. Therefore the determination of  the constitutionality of this provision would be very fact  specific and would depend on the individual facts of each case.
