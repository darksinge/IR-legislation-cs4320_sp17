marries, becomes a member of the armed forces of the United States, or is emancipated by
            
414

    
court order pursuant to Title 78, Chapter 3a, Part 10, Emancipation, the base child support
            
415

    
award is automatically adjusted to [reflect] the base combined child support obligation [shown
            
416

    
in the table] for the remaining number of children due child support, shown in the table that
            
417
