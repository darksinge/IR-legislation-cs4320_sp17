It does not include any                           oral, in person, representation made by a sales representative to a prospective purchaser.

Generic good  means a product which is offered for sale under its common                           descriptive name rather than under a trademark, trade name, brand name, house brand, or other                           distinguishing appellation.                                     Goods and services  means all items which may be the subject of a sales                           transaction.                                     Nondiscounted price  means a price at which the goods or services are offered at                           the time of the price assessment without a temporary store reduction in price.                                     Performing group  means a vocal or instrumental group that performs live music                          for a paying audience.

Price assessor  means a firm or individual that determines the prices,                           including the reference prices, underlying the price comparison, or who makes the price                           comparison.                                            Price comparison  means any express representation that a specific savings,                           reduction, or discount exists or will exist between the supplier s advertised price and another                           specific price.  A representation which does not reasonably imply a comparison to identifiable                           prices or items does not express a price comparison.  Language constituting mere sales                            puffing  is not prohibited by this chapter.                                             Product area  means the geographical area in which the prospective                           purchasers to whom the advertisement is aimed could reasonably be expected to seek the goods                           or services in question.                                      Recording group  means a vocal or instrumental group at least one of the                          members of which has released a commercial sound recording under the group s name, if the                          member has a legal right to use of the group s name.                                             Reference price  means a higher price to which a supplier compares a                           lower price to indicate that a reduction in price exists or will exist.                                             Regular price  means the price at which a supplier has recently offered the                           goods or services for sale in good faith in the regular course of business.  Every price                           represented in an advertisement is considered a regular price unless it is specifically                           represented as a price other than a regular price, such as a discount price or a manufacturer s                           suggested price.  It is prima facie evidence that a price is other than a regular price when it was                           not offered as the nondiscount price of the goods or services for the    days immediately                           preceding an advertisement of the price, and the price change during the    day period was not                           due to price changes inherent in the pricing of seasonal or perishable goods, due to changes in                           cost of the goods or services to the supplier, or due to pricing changes made to match a                           competitor s price.                                                Sales transaction  means a sale, lease, assignment, award by chance, or                           other written or oral transfer or disposition of goods, services, or other property, both tangible                           and intangible  except securities and insurance , to a person or business, or a solicitation or                           offer by a supplier with respect to any of these transfers or dispositions. It includes any offer or                           solicitation, any agreement, and any performance of an agreement with respect to any of these                           transfers or dispositions.                                      Sound recording  means a work resulting from the fixation on a material object,                          such as a disk, tape, or phono record, of musical or instrumental sounds.                                             Supplier  means a seller, lessor, assignor, offeror, broker, or other person                           who regularly solicits, engages in, or enforces sales transactions, whether or not he deals                            directly with the purchaser.                                Section  .    Section         a       is amended to read                                       a  .

   b   For purposes of Subsection     n , with respect to the price of a competitor, the                            price must be one at which the competitor offered the goods or services for sale in the product                            area at the time of the price assessment, and must not be an isolated price.                                 c   For purposes of Subsection     o , an audit, accounting, price assessment, or                            comparison shall be independent if the price assessor randomly selects the goods to be                            compared, and the time and place of the comparison, and no agreement or understanding exists                            between the supplier and the price assessor that could cause the results of the assessment to be                            fraudulent or deceptive.  The independence of an audit, accounting, or price comparison is not                            invalidated merely because the advertiser pays a fee for the audit, accounting, or price                            comparison, but is invalidated if the audit, accounting, or price comparison is done by a full or                            part time employee of the advertiser.                                 d   Examples of a disclosure that complies with Subsection     q  are                                  i    Price assessment performed by Store Z                                   ii    Price assessment performed by a certified public accounting firm   or                                 iii    Price assessment performed by employee of Store Y .                                 e   For the purposes of Subsection     r , goods or services are randomly selected when                            the supplier has no advance knowledge of what goods and services will be surveyed by the                            price assessor, and when the supplier certifies its lack of advance knowledge by an affidavit to                            be retained in the supplier s records for one year.                                 f   i   It is prima facie evidence of compliance with Subsection     s  if                                     A   the goods compared are substantially the same size  and                                 B   the goods compared are of substantially the same quality, which may include                            similar models of competing brands of goods, or goods made of substantially the same                            materials and made with substantially the same workmanship.                                 ii   It is prima facie evidence of a deceptive comparison under this section when the                            prices of brand name goods and generic goods are compared.                                     Any supplier who makes a comparison with a competitor s price in advertising shall                            maintain for a period of one year records that disclose the factual basis for such price                            comparisons and from which the validity of such claim can be established.                                     It is a defense to any claim of false or deceptive price representations under this                            chapter that a person                                  a   has no knowledge that the represented price is not genuine  and                                 b   has made reasonable efforts to determine whether the represented price is genuine.                                     Subsections     m  and  q  do not apply to price comparisons made in catalogs in                            which a supplier compares the price of a single item of its goods or services with those of                            another.                                     To prevail in an action under this chapter, a complainant need not prove                            competition between the parties or actual confusion or misunderstanding.                                     This chapter does not affect unfair trade practices otherwise actionable at common                            law or under other statutes of this state.                                Section  .
