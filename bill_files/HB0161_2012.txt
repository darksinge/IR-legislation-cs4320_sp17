Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:

    Section 1.  
Section  
62A-4a-201

 is amended to read:
            
42

    
     62A-4a-201.  Rights of parents -- Children's rights -- Interest and responsibility of
            
43

    
 state.
            
44

    
    (1) (a)  Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a
            
45

    
parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the
            
46

    
parent's children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves
            
47

    
to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions
            
48

    
or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent's
            
49

    
children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent's constitutional entitlement to heightened
            
50

    
protection against government interference with the parent's fundamental rights and liberty
            
51

    
interests.
            
52

    
    (b)  The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and
            
53

    
management of the parent's children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist
            
54

    
simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent's child is placed in
            
55

    
the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing
            
56

    
the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government
            
57

    
action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or
            
58

    
alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental

            
59


    
unfitness, the child and the child's parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous
            
60

    
termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child's
            
61

    
parents are adversaries.
            
62

    
    (c)  It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and
            
63

    
supervision of the child's natural parents.  A child's need for a normal family life in a
            
64

    
permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships [will usually] is best [be] met
            
65

    
by the child's natural parents, except in extreme cases where additional assistance may be
            
66

    
needed.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit[,] and the right of parents to conceive and
            
67

    
raise their children [have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth
            
68

    
Amendment to the United States Constitution] are constitutionally protected.  The right of a
            
69

    
[fit, competent] parent to raise the parent's child without undue government interference is a
            
70

    
fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution [of this
            
71

    
state and of the United States] and is a fundamental public policy of this state.
            
72

    
    (d)  The state recognizes that:
            
73

    
    (i)  a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,
            
74

    
train, educate, provide for, and reasonably discipline the parent's children; and
            
75

    
    (ii)  the state's role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.
            
76

    
    (e)  It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty
            
77

    
to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their
            
78

    
children.
            
79

    
    (f)  Subsections (2) through (7) shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this
            
80

    
Subsection (1).
            
81

    
    (2)  It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection
            
82

    
from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,
            
83

    
prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title 78A,
            
84

    
Chapter 6, Juvenile Court Act of 1996.  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest in
            
85

    
and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide
            
86

    
for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent's conduct or condition is a
            
87

    
substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and
            
88

    
proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take limited
            
89

    
action for the welfare and protection of the parent's children.

            
90


    
    (3)  When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,
            
91

    
it shall take into account the child's verified need for protection from immediate harm and the
            
92

    
extent to which the child's extended family may provide needed protection.  Throughout its
            
93

    
involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to
            
94

    
protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families,
            
95

    
rather than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.
            
96

    
    (4)  When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child's immediate safety
            
97

    
or welfare, the division may [obtain] seek temporary custody of the child for a [planned]
            
98

    
limited period and place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this
            
99

    
section and in accordance with the requirements of Title 78A, Chapter 6, Part 3, Abuse,
            
100

    
Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.
            
101

    
    (5)  In determining and making "reasonable efforts" with regard to a child, pursuant to
            
102

    
the provisions of Section 

62A-4a-203

, both the division's and the court's paramount concern
            
103

    
shall be the child's health, safety, and welfare, and the constitutionally protected rights of
            
104

    
parents.  The desires of a parent for the parent's child shall be given full and serious
            
105

    
consideration by the division and the court.
            
106

    
    (6)  In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe
            
107

    
abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make "reasonable efforts" or
            
108

    
to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child's home, provide reunification
            
109

    
services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection (6) does
            
110

    
not exempt the division from providing court-ordered services.
            
111

    
    (7) (a)  [It is the division's obligation, under federal law, to] The division shall strive to
            
112

    
achieve appropriate permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  The
            
113

    
division shall provide in-home services in an effort to help a parent to correct the behavior that
            
114

    
resulted in abuse, neglect, or dependency of the parent's child.  If in-home services fail or are
            
115

    
otherwise insufficient or inappropriate, the division shall also seek extended family support or
            
116

    
a kinship placement to maintain a sense of security and stability for the child.  If in-home
            
117

    
services and kinship placement fail and cannot be corrected, the division may pursue a foster
            
118

    
placement.
            
119

    
    (b)  If the use or continuation of "reasonable efforts," as described in Subsections (5)
            
120

    
and (6), is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for a child, then measures

            
121


    
shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan,
            
122

    
and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
            
123

    
    [(b)  If,] (c)  Subject to the parental rights recognized and protected under this section,
            
124

    
if,  because of a parent's conduct or condition, the parent is conclusively determined to be unfit
            
125

    
or incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title 78A,
            
126

    
Chapter 6, Part 5, Termination of Parental Rights Act, the continuing welfare and best interest
            
127

    
of the child [is of paramount importance, and shall govern] shall be protected in determining
            
128

    
whether that parent's rights should be terminated.
            
129

    
    (8)  The state's right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health
            
130

    
care for a child is subject to Subsection 

78A-6-117

(2)(n).
            
131

    
    Section 2.  
Section  
78A-4-201

 is enacted to read:
            
132

    
     78A-4-201.  Appellate review of juvenile courts.
            
133

    
    To uphold the clear and compelling fundamental liberty interests and constitutionally
            
134

    
protected rights of parents and the strong public policy in favor of maximizing family
            
135

    
unification, appellate review shall be equitably applied and made available in furtherance of
            
136

    
those interests and before a permanent termination of parental rights order may take full force
            
137

    
and effect.
            
138

    
    Section 3.  
Section  
78A-6-312

 is amended to read:
            
139

    
     78A-6-312.  Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.
            
140

    
    (1)  The court may:
            
141

    
    (a)  make any of the dispositions described in Section 

78A-6-117

;
            
142

    
    (b)  place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any:
            
143

    
    (i)  individual; or
            
144

    
    (ii)  public or private entity or agency; or
            
145

    
    (c)  order:
            
146

    
    (i)  protective supervision;
            
147

    
    (ii)  family preservation;
            
148

    
    (iii)  subject to Subsection 

78A-6-117

(2)(n)(iii), medical or mental health treatment; or
            
149

    
    (iv)  other services.
            
150

    
    (2)  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that
            
151

    
the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:

            
152


    
    (a)  establish a primary permanency goal for the minor; and
            
153

    
    (b)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency goal, reunification services
            
154

    
are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsections (20) through (22).
            
155

    
    (3)  Subject to Subsections (6) and (7), if the court determines that reunification
            
156

    
services are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for
            
157

    
reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,
            
158

    
unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.
            
159

    
    (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe
            
160

    
abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make
            
161

    
"reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to
            
162

    
attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.
            
163

    
    (5)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount
            
164

    
concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.
            
165

    
    (6)  For purposes of Subsection (3), parent-time is in the best interests of a minor unless
            
166

    
the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:
            
167

    
    (a)  protect the physical safety of the minor;
            
168

    
    (b)  protect the life of the minor; or
            
169

    
    (c)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the
            
170

    
minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.
            
171

    
    (7)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), a court may not deny parent-time based solely on a
            
172

    
parent's failure to:
            
173

    
    (a)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or
            
174

    
    (b)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.
            
175

    
    (8)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a concurrent
            
176

    
permanency goal that shall include:
            
177

    
    (a)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal
            
178

    
will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal; and
            
179

    
    (b)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency
            
180

    
goal.
            
181

    
    (9)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection
            
182

    

78A-6-314

(1)(b) within 30 days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if

            
183


    
something other than reunification is initially established as a minor's primary permanency
            
184

    
goal.
            
185

    
    (10) (a)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency goal before the
            
186

    
establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 

78A-6-314

.
            
187

    
    (b)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event
            
188

    
that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.
            
189

    
    (c)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor's primary
            
190

    
permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section
            
191

    

78A-6-314

 on or before the earlier of:
            
192

    
    (i)  30 days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this
            
193

    
Subsection (10)(c); or
            
194

    
    (ii)  the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section
            
195

    

78A-6-314

, ends.
            
196

    
    (11) (a)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order
            
197

    
that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor's
            
198

    
parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.
            
199

    
    (b)  In providing the services described in Subsection (11)(a), the minor's health, safety,
            
200

    
and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.
            
201

    
    (12)  The court shall:
            
202

    
    (a)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child
            
203

    
and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;
            
204

    
    (b)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family
            
205

    
plan in accordance with Subsection 

62A-4a-205

(6)(e); and
            
206

    
    (c)  identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties, the
            
207

    
responsibilities described in Subsection (12)(b), for the purpose of assisting in any future
            
208

    
determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and
            
209

    
federal law.
            
210

    
    (13) (a)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the
            
211

    
date that the minor was initially removed from the minor's home, unless the time period is
            
212

    
extended under Subsection 

78A-6-314

(8).
            
213

    
    (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12

            
214


    
months of reunification services.
            
215

    
    (14) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at
            
216

    
any time for good and clearly established cause.
            
217

    
    (b)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined
            
218

    
to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section
            
219

    

78A-6-314

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:
            
220

    
    (i)  place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan; and
            
221

    
    (ii)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the
            
222

    
minor.
            
223

    
    (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
224

    
described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
225

    
    (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
226

    
by the court in accordance with Section 

78A-6-314

 at the expiration of the time period for
            
227

    
reunification services.
            
228

    
    (b)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original
            
229

    
removal of the minor.
            
230

    
    (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
231

    
within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78A-6-314

.
            
232

    
    (17)  With regard to a minor who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the minor
            
233

    
is initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
234

    
    (a)  hold a permanency hearing [eight] 12 months after the date of the initial removal,
            
235

    
pursuant to Section 

78A-6-314

; and
            
236

    
    (b)  order the discontinuance of those services after [eight] 12 months from the initial
            
237

    
removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts
            
238

    
to comply with the child and family plan.
            
239

    
    (18)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are
            
240

    
ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six
            
241

    
months from the date that reunification services were ordered:
            
242

    
    (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and
            
243

    
    (b)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.
            
244

    
    (19)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section

            
245


    

78A-6-314

, the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the
            
246

    
sibling group together is:
            
247

    
    (a)  practicable; and
            
248

    
    (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.
            
249

    
    (20) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
250

    
permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
251

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.
            
252

    
    (b)  The court may determine that:
            
253

    
    (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,
            
254

    
based on the individual circumstances; and
            
255

    
    (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.
            
256

    
    (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in
            
257

    
making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount
            
258

    
concern.
            
259

    
    (21)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
260

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
261

    
circumstances exist:
            
262

    
    (a)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
263

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
264

    
    (b)  subject to Subsection (22)(a), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such
            
265

    
magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;
            
266

    
    (c)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,
            
267

    
sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:
            
268

    
    (i)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;
            
269

    
    (ii)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and
            
270

    
    (iii)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual
            
271

    
exploitation;
            
272

    
    (d)  the parent:
            
273

    
    (i)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect; or
            
274

    
    (ii)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:
            
275

    
    (A)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or

            
276


    
    (B)  child abuse homicide;
            
277

    
    (e)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
278

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
279

    
minor;
            
280

    
    (f)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,
            
281

    
and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the
            
282

    
offending parent;
            
283

    
    (g)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;
            
284

    
    (h)  the minor is removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions and
            
285

    
reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;
            
286

    
    (i)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;
            
287

    
    (j)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a
            
288

    
location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation
            
289

    
was located;
            
290

    
    (k)  except as provided in Subsection (22)(b), with respect to a parent who is the child's
            
291

    
birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome or was exposed to an illegal or prescription
            
292

    
drug that was abused by the child's mother while the child was in utero, if the child was taken
            
293

    
into division custody for that reason, unless the mother agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled
            
294

    
in, or has recently and successfully completed a substance abuse treatment program approved
            
295

    
by the department; or
            
296

    
    (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
297

    
efforts or services.
            
298

    
    (22) (a)  The finding under Subsection (21)(b) shall be based on competent evidence
            
299

    
from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing
            
300

    
that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately
            
301

    
caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is made.
            
302

    
    (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection (21)(k) if the court finds, under
            
303

    
the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection
            
304

    
(21)(k) is not warranted.
            
305

    
    (23)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take
            
306

    
into consideration:

            
307


    
    (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child
            
308

    
and family plan;
            
309

    
    (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of
            
310

    
drugs or alcohol;
            
311

    
    (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family
            
312

    
member;
            
313

    
    (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;
            
314

    
    (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;
            
315

    
    (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
316

    
successful; and
            
317

    
    (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.
            
318

    
    (24) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections (20) through
            
319

    
(22), and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which
            
320

    
the out-of-home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide
            
321

    
reunification services.
            
322

    
    (b)  The time limits described in Subsections (2) through (19) are not tolled by the
            
323

    
parent's absence.
            
324

    
    (25) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
325

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.
            
326

    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (25)(a), the court shall
            
327

    
consider:
            
328

    
    (i)  the age of the minor;
            
329

    
    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;
            
330

    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence;
            
331

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment;
            
332

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;
            
333

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;
            
334

    
    (vii)  for a minor 10 years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the
            
335

    
implementation of family reunification services; and
            
336

    
    (viii)  any other appropriate factors.
            
337

    
    (c)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations

            
338


    
imposed in Subsections (2) through (19).
            
339

    
    (d)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time
            
340

    
limitations imposed in Subsections (2) through (19), unless the court determines that continued
            
341

    
reunification services would be in the minor's best interest.
            
342

    
    (26)  If, pursuant to Subsections (21)(b) through (l), the court does not order
            
343

    
reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30 days, in accordance
            
344

    
with Section

347

348

    
    (1)  The state may only terminate parental rights in extreme cases and after fully and
            
349

    
fairly exhausting all reasonably available alternatives and using the least restrictive means as
            
350

    
required to satisfy the constitutional protection of parental rights, and to achieve the strong
            
351

    
public policy in favor of strengthening and uniting families and avoiding or minimizing
            
352

    
removal of a child from the home of the parent to the fullest extent possible.
            
353

    
    (2)  In no event may parental rights be terminated without fully satisfying Section
            
354

    


62A-4a-201

.
            
355

    
    (3)  The state shall provide a parent with reasonably sufficient time and support to
            
356

    
prevent or correct conditions that may otherwise cause a parent to be charged with unfitness
            
357

    
and loss of the parent's child.
            
358

    
    (4)  The state shall make all reasonable efforts to avoid removing a child from the
            
359

    
custody of the child's parent and the child's home.
            
360

    
    (5)  When a child is removed from the custody of a parent, the state shall earnestly
            
361

    
strive to reunify the family.
            
362

    
    (6)  No federal law, mandate, regulation, or financial contribution to the state shall be
            
363

    
allowed to interfere with or undermine parental rights and the public policy of this state.
            
364

    
    (7)  When conditions arise that may limit a parent's ability to care and provide for a
            
365

    
child, grandparents, extended family, and kin who are willing and able to provide family
            
366

    
support are entitled to offer and provide support without interference from the state.
            
367

    
    (8)  Temporary deficiencies of a parent are not grounds for permanent termination of
            
368

    
parental rights.

            
369


    
    (9)  The court may not impose a premature or fixed time limit on the continuing
            
370

    
progress of a parent who earnestly seeks to improve the parent's parenting abilities and protect
            
371

    
the best interests of the parent's child.  The state shall be a support and not a threat thereto.
            
372

    
    [(1)] (10)  This part provides a judicial process for voluntary and involuntary severance
            
373

    
of the parent-child relationship, designed to safeguard the rights and interests of all parties
            
374

    
concerned and promote their welfare and that of the state.
            
375

    
    [(2)] (11)  Wherever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved, but if a
            
376

    
parent is found, by reason of [his] the parent's conduct or condition, to be unfit or incompetent
            
377

    
based upon any of the grounds for termination described in this part, the court shall then
            
378

    
balance and consider the welfare and best interest of the child [of paramount importance] in
            
379

    
determining whether termination of parental rights shall be ordered.
