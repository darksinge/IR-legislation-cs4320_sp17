    (e)  an agreement by the shareholder to continue to pay all applicable corporate

application, pursuant to Subsection (3)(a), the failure to respond shall be considered to be a

            
59


    
denial of the request.
            
60

    
    (d)  The water company may not withhold approval if any potential damage, liability, or

share of the water company's right;
            
70

    
    (iv)  impairment of either the quantity or quality of water delivered to other

regulation, or order of a court or governmental agency;

shareholder may choose to prepay any portion of the water company assessments attributable to
            
84

    
an existing debt of the water company.
            
85

    
    (b)  Other than prepaid assessments, the water company may require that the

105

    
state engineer for an order canceling the change application.
