    (A)  at least 24 years of age; or
            
158

    
    (B)  not claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax returns; and

the death of a spouse, or long-term health care responsibilities for an immediate family
            
172

    
member, including the person's spouse, parent, sibling, or child, may rebut the presumption of a
            
173

    
nonresident classification by providing substantial evidence that the reason for the individual's
            
174

    
move to Utah was, in good faith, based on the long-term health care responsibilities.

187

    
    (B)  not claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax returns; and
