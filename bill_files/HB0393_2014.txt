consultant's spouse is an owner, executive, or employee; or

    (B)  to which the producer for the insured or consultant has the type of relation that a
            
39

    
material benefit would accrue to the producer for the insured or consultant or spouse as a result

48

    
    (ii)  The producer for the insured's or consultant's fee shall be agreed upon, in writing,
