IX(i) of that Agreement including after final determination of all adjustments, that such
            
182

    
manufacturer would have been required to make on account of such units sold had it been a

            
183


    
participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert back to such
            
184

    
tobacco product manufacturer; or
            
185

    
    (c)  to the extent not released from escrow under Subsection (2)(a) or (b), funds shall be

187

    
date on which they were placed into escrow.
            
188

    
    (3)  Each tobacco product manufacturer that elects to place funds into escrow pursuant

204

    
impose a civil penalty to be paid to the General Fund of the State in an amount not to exceed

206

    
amount not to exceed 300% of the original amount improperly withheld from escrow; and
            
207

    
    (c)  in the case of a second knowing violation, be prohibited from selling cigarettes to

209

    
intermediary) for a period not to exceed 2 years.
            
210

    
    (4)  Each failure to make an annual deposit required under Subsection (1)(b) shall
            
211

    
constitute a separate violation.
            
212

    
    (5)  A court shall award the State its costs and attorneys fees incurred in bringing any
            
213

    
action in which the State establishes that a tobacco product manufacturer has violated this

            
214


    
section.
            
215

    
    Section 4.  
Section  
59-22-308

 is amended to read:
            
216

    
     59-22-308.  Payments by subsequent participating manufacturers.
            
217

    
    Section XI(i)(2) and IX(i)(3) of the Master Settlement Agreement[, which are
            
218

    
referenced in Subsection 

59-22-203

(2)(b),] involve payments by subsequent participating
            
219

    
manufacturers and providers as follows:
            
220

    
    (1)  A Subsequent Participating Manufacturer shall have payment obligations under this
            
221

    
Agreement only in the event that its Market Share in any calendar year exceeds the greater of
            
222

    
(1)  its 1998 Market Share or (2) 125% of its 1997 Market Share, subject to the provisions of
            
223

    
subsection (i)(4).  In the year following any such calendar year, such Subsequent Participating
            
224

    
Manufacturer shall make payments corresponding to those due in that same following year
            
225

    
from the Original Participating Manufacturers pursuant to subsections VI(c), except for the
            
226

    
payment due on March 31, 1999, IX(c)(1), IX(c)(2) and IX(e).  The amounts of such
            
227

    
corresponding payments by a Subsequent Participating Manufacturer are in addition to the
            
228

    
corresponding payments that are due from the Original Participating Manufacturers and shall
            
229

    
be determined as described in subsection (2) and (3) below.  Such payments by a Subsequent
            
230

    
Participating Manufacturer shall (A) be due on the same dates as the corresponding payments
            
231

    
are due from Original Participating manufacturers; (B) be for the same purpose as such
            
232

    
corresponding payments; and (C) be paid, allocated and distributed in the same manner as such
            
233

    
corresponding payments.
            
234

    
    (2)  The base amount due from a Subsequent Participating Manufacturer on any given
            
235

    
date shall be determined by multiplying (A) the corresponding base amount due on the same
            
236

    
date from all of the Original Participating Manufacturers, as such base amount is specified in
            
237

    
the corresponding subsection of this agreement and is adjusted by the Volume Adjustment,
            
238

    
except for the provisions of subsection (B)(ii) of Exhibit E, but before such base amount is
            
239

    
modified by any other adjustments, reductions or offsets, by (B) the quotient produced by
            
240

    
dividing (i) the result of (x) such Subsequent Participating Manufacturer's Applicable Market
            
241

    
Share, the applicable Market Share being that for the calendar year immediately preceding the
            
242

    
year in which the payment in question is due, minus (y) the greater of (1) its 1998 Market Share
            
243

    
or (2) 125% of its 1997 Market Share, by (ii) the aggregate Market Shares of the Original
            
244

    
Participating Manufacturers, the applicable Market Shares being those for the calendar year

            
245


    
immediately preceding the year in which the payment in question is due.
            
246

    
    (3)  Any payment due from a Subsequent Participating Manufacturer under subsections
            
247

    
(1) and (2) above shall be subject, up to the full amount of such payment, to the Inflation
            
248

    
Adjustment, the Nonsettling States Reduction, the NPM Adjustment, the offset for
            
249

    
miscalculated or disputed payments described in subsection XI(i), the Federal Tobacco
            
250

    
Legislation Offset, the Litigating Releasing Parties Offset and the offsets for claims over
            
251

    
described in subsections XII(a)(4)(B) and XII(a)(8), to the extent that such adjustments,
            
252

    
reductions or offsets would apply to the corresponding payment due from the Original
            
253

    
Participating Manufacturers.  Provided, however, that all adjustments and offsets to which a
            
254

    
Subsequent Participating Manufacturer is entitled may only be applied against payments by
            
255

    
such Subsequent Participating Manufacturer, if any, that are due within 12 months after the
            
256

    
date on which the Subsequent Participating Manufacturer becomes entitled to such adjustment
            
257

    
or makes the payment that entitles it to such offset, and shall not be carried forward beyond that
            
258

    
time even if not fully used.
            
259

    
    (4)  For purposes of this Subsection (i), the 1997, or 1998, as applicable, Market Share,
            
260

    
and 125% thereof, of those Subsequent Participating Manufacturers that either (A) became a
            
261

    
signatory to the Agreement more than 60 days after the MSA Execution Date or (B) had no
            
262

    
Market Share in 1997, or 1998, as applicable, shall equal zero.
            
263

    
    Section 5.   Severability clause.
            
264

    
    If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the amendments to Section 

59-22-203

 of
            
265

    
this bill and the provisions of Chapter 22, Model Tobacco Settlement Act, conflict and cannot
            
266

    
be harmonized, then the provisions of Chapter 22, Model Tobacco Settlement Act, shall
            
267

    
control.  If any part of the amendments to Section 

59-22-203

 causes Chapter 22, Model
            
268

    
Tobacco Settlement Act to no longer constitute a qualifying or model statute, as defined in the
            
269

    
Master Settlement Agreement, that part of the amendments to Section 

59-22-203

 shall not be
            
270

    
valid.  If any part of the amendments to Section 

59-22-203

 is for any reason held to be invalid,
            
271

    
unlawful, or unconstitutional, the validity of the remaining part of the amendments to Section
            
272

    


59-22-203

 shall not be affected.
