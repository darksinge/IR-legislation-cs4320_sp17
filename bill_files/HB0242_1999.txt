The district shall provide employees with a written statement of causes under which                           a contract shall not be renewed, under which a contract of each class of personnel shall not be                           renewed, and under which a contract can be otherwise terminated during the contract term, and the                           orderly dismissal procedures which are used by the district in cases of contract termination.                                    a   The district shall notify a career employee, at least one month prior to issuing notice                           of intent not to renew the employee s contract, that continued employment is in question and the                           reasons for anticipated nonrenewal.                                b   The board shall give the career employee an opportunity to correct the problem.                                c   The board may grant the career employee assistance to correct the deficiencies,                           including informal conferences and the services of school personnel within the district.                                    a   If the career employee does not correct the problem as determined in accordance                              with the evaluation and personnel policies of the district and the district intends to not renew the                           contract of employment of a career employee, it shall give notice of that intention to the employee.                                b   The district shall issue the notice at least two months before the end of the career                           employee s contract term.                                    A district shall notify a provisional employee at least two months before the end of the                           provisional employee s contract if the employee will not be offered a contract for a subsequent                           term of employment.                                    In the absence of a notice, an employee is considered employed for the next contract                           term with a salary based upon the salary schedule applicable to the class of employee into which                           the individual falls.                                    If the district intends to not renew the contract of a career employee or to terminate a                           career or provisional employee s contract during the contract term                                 a   the district shall give written notice of the intent to the employee                                 b  the notice shall be served by personal delivery or by certified mail addressed to the                           individual s last known address as shown on the records of the district                                 c  except as provided under Subsection     b , the district shall give notice at least    days                           prior to the proposed date of termination                                 d  the notice shall state the date of termination and the detailed reasons for termination                            and                                e   the notice shall advise the individual that he has a right to a fair hearing.                                    The procedure under which a contract is terminated during its term may include a                           provision under which the active service of the employee is suspended pending a hearing if it                           appears that the continued employment of the individual may be harmful to students or to the                           district.                                    a   Suspension pending a hearing may be without pay if an authorized representative                          of the district determines, after an informal conference with the employee, that it is more likely                          than not that the allegations against the employee are true and will result in termination.                                b   If termination is not subsequently ordered, the employee shall receive back pay for the                          period of suspension without pay.                                          The procedure shall provide for a written notice of suspension or final termination                           including findings of fact upon which the action is based if the suspension or termination is for                              cause.
