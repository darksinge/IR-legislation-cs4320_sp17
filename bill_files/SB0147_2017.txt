Section 78B-15-607 is amended to read:112          78B-15-607. Limitation -- Child having presumed father.113          (1)  Paternity of a child conceived or born during a marriage with a presumed father, as114     described in Subsection 78B-15-204(1)(a), (b), or (c), may be raised by the presumed father115     [or], the mother, or a support enforcement agency at any time [prior to] before filing an action116     for divorce or in the pleadings at the time of the divorce of the parents.117          (a)  If the issue is raised prior to the adjudication, genetic testing may be ordered by the118     tribunal in accordance with Section 78B-15-608.  Failure of the mother of the child to appear119     for testing may result in an order allowing a motherless calculation of paternity.  Failure of the120     mother to make the child available may not result in a determination that the presumed father is121     not the father, but shall allow for appropriate proceedings to compel the cooperation of the122     mother.  If the question of paternity has been raised in the pleadings in a divorce and the123     tribunal addresses the issue and enters an order, the parties are estopped from raising the issue124     again, and the order of the tribunal may not be challenged on the basis of material mistake of125     fact.126          (b)  If the presumed father seeks to rebut the presumption of paternity, then denial of a127     motion seeking an order for genetic testing or a decision to disregard genetic test results shall128     be based on a preponderance of the evidence.129          (c)  If the mother seeks to rebut the presumption of paternity, the mother has the burden130     to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would be in the best interests of the child to131     disestablish the parent-child relationship.132          (d)  If a support enforcement agency seeks to rebut the presumption of parentage and133     the presumptive parent opposes the rebuttal, the agency's request shall be denied.  Otherwise,134     the denial of the agency's motion seeking an order for genetic testing or a decision to disregard135     genetic test results shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence, taking into account the136     best interests of the child.137          (2)  For the presumption outside of marriage described in Subsection 78B-15-204(1)(d),138     the presumption may be rebutted at any time if the tribunal determines that the presumed father139     and the mother of the child neither cohabited nor engaged in sexual intercourse with each other140     during the probable time of conception.141          (3)  The presumption may be rebutted by:142          (a)  genetic test results that exclude the presumed father;143          (b)  genetic test results that rebuttably identify another man as the father in accordance144     with Section 78B-15-505;145          (c)  evidence that the presumed father and the mother of the child neither cohabited nor146     engaged in sexual intercourse with each other during the probable time of conception; or147          (d)  an adjudication under this part.148          (4)  There is no presumption to rebut if the presumed father was properly served and149     there has been a final adjudication of the issue.
