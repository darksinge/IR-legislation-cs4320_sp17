35

    
     63-38f-701.  Purpose.
            
36

    
    (1) (a)  The Legislature recognizes that the growth of new industry and expansion of
            
37

    
existing industry requires a strong technology base, new ideas, concepts, innovations, and
            
38

    
prototypes.
            
39

    
    (b)  These generally come from strong research colleges and universities.
            
40

    
    (c)  Technical research in Utah's colleges and universities should be enhanced and
            
41

    
expanded, particularly in those areas targeted by the state for economic development.
            
42

    
    (d)  Most states are enhancing their research base by direct funding, usually on a
            
43

    
matching basis.
            
44

    
    (e)  The purpose of this part is to catalyze and enhance the growth of these technologies
            
45

    
by encouraging interdisciplinary research activities in targeted areas.
            
46

    
    (f)  The Legislature recognizes that one source of funding is in matching state funds
            
47

    
with federal funds and industrial support to provide the needed new technologies.
            
48

    
    (2)  The Legislature recommends that the governor consider the allocation of economic
            
49

    
development funds for Centers of Excellence to be matched by industry and federal grants on at
            
50

    
least a two-for-one basis for colleges and universities in the state that offer any doctoral
            
51

    
degrees.
            
52

    
    (3) (a)  The Legislature recommends that the funds be allocated on a competitive basis
            
53

    
to the various colleges and universities in the state.
            
54

    
    (b)  The funds made available should be used to support interdisciplinary research in
            
55

    
specialized Centers of Excellence in technologies that are considered to have potential for
            
56

    
economic development in this state.

for the purposes of this part.
            
63

    
    (b)  The governor's Office of Economic Development shall develop a process to
            
64

    
determine whether a college or university that receives a grant under this part must return the
            
65

    
grant proceeds if the technology that is developed with the grant proceeds is licensed to a
            
66

    
licensee that:
            
67

    
    (i)  does not maintain a manufacturing or service location in the state from which the
            
68

    
licensee or a sublicensee exploits the technology; or
            
69

    
    (ii)  initially maintains a manufacturing or service location in the state from which the
            
70

    
licensee or a sublicensee exploits the technology, but within five years after issuance of the
            
71

    
license the licensee or sublicensee transfers the manufacturing or service location for the
            
72

    
technology to a location out of the state.
            
73

    
    (3) (a)  Funding allocations shall be made by the office with the advice of the State

    (4) (a)  In considering each proposal, the office shall weigh technical merit, the level of
            
77

    
matching funds from private and federal sources, and the potential for job creation and
            
78

    
economic development.
            
79

    
    (b)  Proposals or consortia that combine and coordinate related research at two or more
            
80

    
colleges and universities shall be encouraged.
            
81
