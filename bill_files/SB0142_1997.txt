    and grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads,

    closely resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and

    complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls and spoil piles

    eliminated; but water impoundments may be permitted where the division determines that they are

    in compliance with Subsection 40-10-17(2)(h).

    renewal of same, as required by this chapter, including public notification and an opportunity for a

    public hearing as required by Section 40-10-13, the division shall grant, require modification of, or

    deny the application for a permit in a reasonable time set by the division and notify the applicant in

    writing.  The applicant for a permit, or revision of a permit, shall have the burden of establishing that

    his application is in compliance with all the requirements of this chapter.  Within ten days after the

    granting of a permit, the division shall notify the local governmental officials in the local political

    subdivision in which the area of land to be affected is located that a permit has been issued and shall

    describe the location of the land.

        (2)  No permit or revision application shall be approved unless the application affirmatively

    demonstrates and the division finds in writing on the basis of the information set forth in the

    application or from information otherwise available which will be documented in the approval and

    made available to the applicant, that:

        (a)  the permit application is accurate and complete and that all the requirements of this

    chapter have been complied with;

        (b)  the applicant has demonstrated that reclamation as required by this chapter can be

    accomplished under the reclamation plan contained in the permit application;

        (c)  the assessment of the probable cumulative impact of all anticipated mining in the area

    on the hydrologic balance specified in Subsection 40-10-10(2)(c) has been made by the division and

    the proposed operation of same has been designed to prevent material damage to hydrologic balance

    outside the permit area;

        (d)  the area proposed to be mined is not included within an area designated unsuitable for

    surface coal mining pursuant to Section 40-10-24 or is not within an area under study for such

    designation in an administrative proceeding commenced pursuant to Subsection 40-10-24(2) (unless

    in the area as to which an administrative proceeding has commenced pursuant to Section 40-10-24,

    the operator demonstrates that prior to January 1, 1977, he has made substantial legal and financial

    commitments in relation to the operation for which he is applying for a permit);

        (e)  the proposed surface coal mining operation would:

        (i)  not interrupt, discontinue, or preclude farming on alluvial valley floors that are irrigated

- 5 -


    or naturally subirrigated, but excluding undeveloped range lands which are not significant to farming

    on the alluvial valley floors and those lands as to which the division finds that if the farming that will

    be interrupted, discontinued, or precluded is of such small acreage as to be of negligible impact on

    the farm's agricultural production; or

        (ii)  not materially damage the quantity or quality of water in surface or underground water

    systems that supply these alluvial valley floors in Subsection (2)(e)(i), but this Subsection (2)(e)

    shall not affect those surface coal mining operations which in the year preceding August 3, 1977,

    produced coal in commercial quantities and were located within or adjacent to alluvial valley floors

    or had obtained specific permit approval by the division to conduct surface coal mining operations

    within these alluvial valley floors;

        (f)  in cases where the private mineral estate has been severed from the private surface estate,

    the applicant has submitted to the division:

        (i)  the written consent of the surface owner to the extraction of coal by surface mining

    methods; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as increasing or

    diminishing any property rights by the State of Utah or by any other landowner;

        (ii)  a conveyance that expressly grants or reserves the right to extract the coal by surface

    mining methods; or

        (iii)  if the conveyance does not expressly grant the right to extract coal by surface mining

    methods, the surface-subsurface legal relationship shall be determined in accordance with state law.

        (3)  The applicant shall file with his permit application a schedule listing any and all notices

    of violations of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 or its implementing

    regulations, this chapter, any state or federal program or law approved under the Surface Mining

    Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. Sec. 1201 et seq., and any law, rule, or regulation

    of the United States, State of Utah, or any department or agency in the United States pertaining to

    air or water environmental protection incurred by the applicant in connection with any surface coal

    mining operation during the three-year period prior to the date of application.  The schedule shall

    also indicate the final resolution of any notice of violation.  Where the schedule or other information

    available to the division indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the

- 6 -


    applicant is currently in violation of this chapter or other laws and regulations referred to in this

    Subsection (3), the permit shall not be issued until the applicant submits proof that the violation has

    been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the division, department,

    or agency which has jurisdiction over the violation; and no permit shall be issued to an applicant

    after a finding by the board after opportunity for hearing that the applicant, or the operator specified

    in the application, controls or has controlled mining operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful

    violations of this chapter of such nature and duration with such resulting irreparable damage to the

    environment as to indicate an intent not to comply with the provisions of this chapter.

        (4) (a)  In addition to finding the application in compliance with Subsection (2), if the area

    proposed to be mined contains prime farmland pursuant to division rules, the division shall grant a

    permit to mine on prime farmland if the division finds in writing that the operator has the

    technological capability to restore the mined area within a reasonable time to equivalent or higher

    levels of yield as nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of

    management and can meet the soil reconstruction standards specified in division rules. Except for

    compliance with Subsection (2), the requirements of this subsection  shall apply to all permits issued

    after August 3, 1977.

        (b)  Nothing in Subsection (4) shall apply to any permit issued prior to August 3, 1977, or

    to any revisions or renewals of it, or to any existing surface mining operations for which a permit

    was issued prior to August 3, 1977.

        (5) (a)  After October [14] 24, 1992, the prohibition of Subsection (3) does not apply to a

    permit application, if the violation resulted from an unanticipated event or condition that occurred

    at a surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for remining under a permit held by the person

    making the application.

        (b)  As used in this subsection, the term "violation" has the same meaning as the term has

    under Subsection (3).

        (c)  Subsection (5) is repealed September 30, 2004.

        Section 3.  Section  40-10-13 is amended to read:

         40-10-13.  Advertisement of ownership, location, and boundaries -- Notice to interested

- 7 -


     agencies or bodies -- Objections -- Conference.

        (1)  At the time of submission of an application for a surface coal mining and reclamation

    permit, or revision of an existing permit pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the applicant shall

    submit to the division a copy of his advertisement of the ownership, precise location, and boundaries

    of the land to be affected.  At the time of submission the advertisement shall be placed by the

    applicant in a local newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the proposed surface mine at

    least once a week for four consecutive weeks.  The division shall notify various local governmental

    bodies, planning agencies, and sewage and water treatment authorities of water companies in the

    locality in which the proposed surface mining will take place, notifying them of the operator's

    intention to surface mine a particularly described tract of land and indicating the application's permit

    number and where a copy of the proposed mining and reclamation plan may be inspected.  These

    local bodies, agencies, authorities, or companies may submit written comments within a reasonable

    period established by the division on the mining applications with respect to the effects of the

    proposed operation on the environment which are within their area of responsibility.  These

    comments shall immediately be transmitted to the applicant by the division and shall be made

    available to the public at the same locations as are the mining applications.

        (2) (a)  Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected or the officer

    or head of any federal, state, or local governmental agency or authority shall have the right to file

    written objections to the proposed initial or revised application for a permit for surface coal mining

    and reclamation operations with the division within 30 days after the last publication of the notice. 

    These objections shall immediately be transmitted to the applicant by the division and shall be made

    available to the public.

        (b)  If written objections are filed and a conference requested, the division shall then hold a

    conference within a reasonable time of the receipt of the objections or request. The conference shall

    be informal and shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures described in this Subsection

    (b), irrespective of the requirements of Section 63-46b-5, Administrative Procedures Act.  The

    conference [may] shall be held in the locality of the coal mining and reclamation operation if

    requested within a reasonable time after written objections or the request for an informal conference

- 8 -


    are received by the division.  The date, time, and location of the conference shall be advertised by

    the division in a newspaper of general circulation in the locality at least two weeks prior to the

    scheduled conference date.  The division may arrange with the applicant upon request by any party

    to the administrative proceeding access to the proposed mining area for the purpose of gathering

    information relevant to the proceeding.  An electronic or stenographic record shall be made of the

    conference proceeding unless waived by all parties.  This record shall be maintained and shall be

    accessible to the parties until final release of the applicant's performance bond.  In the event all

    parties requesting the conference stipulate agreement prior to the requested conference and withdraw

    their request, the conference need not be held.

        Section 4.  Section  40-10-17 (Subsect (2)(t)(ii) Repeal 09/30/04) is amended to read:

         40-10-17 (Subsect (2)(t)(ii) Repeal 09/30/04).  Performance standards for all coal

     mining and reclamation operations -- Additional standards for steep-slope surface coal mining

     -- Variances.

        (1)  Any permit issued pursuant to this chapter to conduct surface coal mining shall require

    that the surface coal mining operations will meet all applicable performance standards of this

    chapter, and such other requirements as the division shall promulgate.

        (2)  General performance standards shall be applicable to all surface coal mining and

    reclamation operations and shall require the operations as a minimum to:

        (a)  Conduct surface coal mining operations so as to maximize the utilization and

    conservation of the solid fuel resource being recovered so that reaffecting the land in the future

    through surface coal mining can be minimized.

        (b)  Restore the land affected to a condition capable of supporting the uses which it was

    capable of supporting prior to any mining, or higher or better uses of which there is reasonable

    likelihood, so long as the use or uses does not present any actual or probable hazard to public health

    or safety or pose any actual or probable threat of water diminution or pollution, and the permit

    applicant's declared proposed land use following reclamation is not deemed to be impractical or

    unreasonable, inconsistent with applicable land use policies and plans, involves unreasonable delay

    in implementation, or is violative of federal, state, or local law.

- 9 -


        (c)  Except as provided in Subsection (3) with respect to all surface coal mining operations

    backfill, compact (where advisable to insure stability or to prevent leaching of toxic materials) and

    grade in order to restore the approximate original contour of the land with highwalls, spoil piles, and

    depressions eliminated (unless small depressions are needed in order to retain moisture to assist

    revegetation or as otherwise authorized pursuant to this chapter); but in surface coal mining which

    is carried out at the same location over a substantial period of time where the operation transects the

    coal deposit and the thickness of the coal deposits relative to the volume of the overburden is large

    and where the operator demonstrates that the overburden and other spoil and waste materials at a

    particular point in the permit area or otherwise available from the entire permit area is insufficient,

    giving due consideration to volumetric expansion, to restore the approximate original contour, the

    operator, at a minimum, shall backfill, grade, and compact (where advisable) using all available

    overburden and other spoil and waste materials to attain the lowest practicable grade but not more

    than the angle of repose, to provide adequate drainage and to cover all acid-forming and other toxic

    materials, in order to achieve an ecologically sound land use compatible with the surrounding region. 

    In surface coal mining where the volume of overburden is large relative to the thickness of the coal

    deposit and where the operator demonstrates that due to volumetric expansion the amount of

    overburden and other spoil and waste materials removed in the course of the mining operation is

    more than sufficient to restore the approximate original contour, the operator shall, after restoring

    the approximate contour, backfill, grade, and compact (where advisable) the excess overburden and

    other spoil and waste materials to attain the lowest grade but more than the angle of repose, and to

    cover all acid-forming and other toxic materials, in order to achieve an ecologically sound land use

    compatible with the surrounding region and that the overburden or spoil shall be shaped and graded

    in such a way as to prevent slides, erosion, and water pollution and is revegetated in accordance with

    the requirements of this chapter.

        (d)  Stabilize and protect all surface areas, including spoil piles affected by the surface coal

    mining and reclamation operation to effectively control erosion and attendant air and water pollution.

        (e)  Remove the topsoil from the land in a separate layer, replace it on the backfill area, or

    if not utilized immediately, segregate it in a separate pile from other spoil, and when the topsoil is

- 10 -


    not replaced on a backfill area within a time short enough to avoid deterioration of the topsoil,

    maintain a successful cover by quick growing plant or other means thereafter so that the topsoil is

    preserved from wind and water erosion, remains free of any contamination by other acid or toxic

    material, and is in a usable condition for sustaining vegetation when restored during reclamation;

    except if topsoil is of insufficient quantity or of poor quality for sustaining vegetation, or if other

    strata can be shown to be more suitable for vegetation requirements, then the operator shall remove,

    segregate, and preserve in a like manner the other strata which is best able to support vegetation.

        (f)  Restore the topsoil or the best available subsoil which is best able to support vegetation.

        (g)  For all prime farmlands, as identified in the rules, to be mined and reclaimed,

    specifications for soil removal, storage, replacement, and reconstruction, the operator shall, as a

    minimum, be required to:

        (b)  When a bond or deposit for a [coal] surface coal mining operation on lands eligible for
