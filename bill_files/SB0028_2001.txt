This act modifies provisions related to the State System of Public Education to address issues
            

    
 related to the Utah Performance Assessment System for Students (U-PASS).  The act
            

    
 expands the categories for disaggregating student performance data to include limited
            

    
 English proficiency.  The act requires each local school board to provide its staff with a
            

    
 professional development program to effectively implement and maintain U-PASS at the
            

    
 school and classroom levels.  The act requires additional data to be reported on the annual
            

    
 school performance report on issues related to reading proficiency, student absenteeism,
            

    
 staff qualifications, average daily attendance, and disaggregated enrollment totals.  The act
            

    
 also requires electronic reporting of additional data related to test scores and trends, grade
            

    
 averages, volunteerism, student discipline, and fee waivers.  This act takes effect July 1, 2001,
            

    
 except that the school performance report modifications take effect July 1, 2002.
