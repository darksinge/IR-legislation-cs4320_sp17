    The Division assigns a charge to all services performed regardless of the
client's or third party insurer's financial responsibility or the likelihood of
receiving payment for the services.  Projected numbers of units of services are
based on past experiences but are subject to significant variation determined
by the actual needs of patients and changes in medical practices.  Hence, it is
not possible to calculate the change in revenue resulting from a change in the
charge for a given service.
