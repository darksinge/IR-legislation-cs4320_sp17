Section      A           is amended to read                                   A      .  Effect of filing affidavit    Procedure for review and collection.                                    a   Upon receipt of the oath or affirmation filed with any Utah court by a prisoner,                           the court shall immediately request the institution or facility where the prisoner is incarcerated                           to provide an account statement detailing all financial activities in the prisoner s trust account                           for the previous six months or since the time of incarceration, whichever is shorter.                                b   The incarcerating facility shall                                 i   prepare and produce to the court the prisoner s six month trust account statement,                           current trust account balance, and aggregate disposable income  and                                ii   calculate aggregate disposable income by totaling all deposits made in the                           prisoner s trust account during the six month period and subtracting all funds automatically                           deducted or otherwise garnished from the account during the same period.                                    The court shall                                 a   review both the affidavit of impecuniosity and the financial account statement  and                                b   based upon the review, independently determine whether or not the prisoner is                           financially capable of paying all the regular fees and costs associated with filing the action.                                    When the court concludes that the prisoner is unable to pay full fees and costs, the                           court shall assess an initial partial filing fee equal to     of the prisoner s current trust account                           balance or     of the prisoner s six month aggregate disposable income, whichever is greater.                                    a   After payment of the initial partial filing fee, the court shall require the prisoner                           to make monthly payments of     of the preceding month s aggregate disposable income until                           the regular filing fee associated with the civil action is paid in full.                                b   The agency having custody of the prisoner shall                                 i   garnish the prisoner s account each month  and                                ii  once the collected fees exceed    , forward payments to the clerk of the court until                           the filing fees are paid.                                c   Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent the agency having custody of                           the prisoner from withdrawing funds from the prisoner s account to pay court ordered                           restitution.                                       Collection of the filing fees continues despite dismissal of the action.                                    The filing fee collected may not exceed the amount of fees permitted by statute for                           the commencement of a civil action or an appeal of a civil action.                                    If the prisoner is filing an initial divorce action or an action to obtain custody of the                          prisoner s children, the following procedures shall apply for review and collection of fees and                          costs                                 a   Upon filing an oath or affirmation with any Utah court by a prisoner, the court shall                          review the affidavit and make an independent determination based on the information provided                          whether court costs and fees should be paid in full or be waived in whole or in part.  The court                          shall require a full or partial filing fee when the prisoner s financial information demonstrates                          an ability to pay the applicable court fees or costs.                                b   i   If a prisoner s court fees or costs are completely waived, and if the prisoner files                          an appeal, the court shall immediately file any complaint or papers on appeal and complete all                          necessary action as promptly as if the litigant had paid all the fees and costs in full.                                ii   If a prisoner is impecunious, the constable and sheriff shall immediately serve any                          summonses, writs, process and subpoenas, and papers necessary in the prosecution or defense                          of the cause as if all the necessary fees and costs had been paid in full.                                c   i   If a prisoner files an affidavit of impecuniosity, the judge shall question the                          prisoner at the time of hearing on the merits of the case as to the prisoner s ability to pay.                                ii   If the judge determines that the person is reasonably able to pay court fees and                          costs, the judge shall order that the judgment or decree not be entered in favor of the prisoner                          until the fees or costs are paid in full.                                iii   If a judge orders that a judgment or decree not be entered in favor of the prisoner                          because the fees or costs are not paid in full, a judge may cancel or modify that order as                          warranted by subsequent facts.
