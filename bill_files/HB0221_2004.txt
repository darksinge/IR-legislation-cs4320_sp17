 Legislative Review Note
    as of   1-14-04  3:48 PM

This bill prohibits the use of credit information for any purpose related to personal lines
insurance.  Because the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) permits a credit agency to
provide credit reports to persons who intend to use the information in connection with the
underwriting of insurance and addresses insurance transactions not initiated by the consumer,
this bill might be challenged as being preempted by the FCRA.  The FCRA provides that it
does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person from complying with state law with respect
to the collection, distribution, or use of any information, except to the extent that the state law
is inconsistent with the FCRA.  The FCRA then expressly prohibits certain state laws. In
reviewing this bill it would be for a court to decide whether FCRA expressly preempts this bill
or whether this bill is consistent with the FCRA.
