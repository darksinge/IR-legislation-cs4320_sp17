Ferrin                             This act modifies provisions relating to Divorce and Parent time.  It prohibits courts from                          considering gender when determining custody in a divorce and specifies considerations for                          the court in determining parent time.  In addition, this act revises the parent time sanctions                          found in the Judicial Code.                          This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                            AMENDS                                       , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                                REPEALS AND REENACTS                                        . , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .    Section                is amended to read                                        .  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody                           consideration.                                    If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is declared                           void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the minor                           children as it considers appropriate.  In determining custody, the court shall consider the best                           interests of the child  and the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the                          parties .  The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s desires                           regarding future custody or parent time schedules, but the expressed desires are not controlling and                           the court may determine the children s custody or parent time otherwise.  Interviews with the                           children may be conducted by the judge in camera only with the prior consent of the parties.

The court may not consider the gender of the parties in determining custody.                                          If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has                           attempted to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into                           consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other parent.                                          a   A court may not discriminate against a parent due to a disability, as defined                           in Section                , in awarding custody or determining whether a substantial change has occurred                           for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.                                b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining                           whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody, the                           parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising therefrom by                           showing that                                 i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to provide                           for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or                                ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources available                           to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at                           issue.                                c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to                                 i   abuse, neglect, or dependency proceedings under Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and                           Family Services, or Title   , Chapter  a, Juvenile Courts  or                                ii   adoption proceedings under Title   , Chapter   , Adoption.
