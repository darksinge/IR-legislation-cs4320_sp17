with respect to the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) that:(a)  agricultural livestock industry on the lands comprising these zones has provided asignificant contribution to the history, customs, culture, economy, welfare, and other values ofeach area for more than 100 years;(b)  the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exist within these zonesif managed properly, that will support and expand continued, responsible agricultural livestockactivities;(c)  agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources,human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural resources, landmarks,structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition,preservation, and protection;(d) (i)  the highest management priorities for lands within these zones are responsiblepreservation and enhancement, and restoration and development of historic, existing, andfuture grazing resources in order to provide protection for the resources, objects, customs,culture, and values identified above; and(ii)  notwithstanding Subsection (4)(d)(i), if part or all of any zone lies within a sagegrouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent withthe management priorities set forth in Subsection (4)(d)(i) to the maximum extent consistentwith the management priorities of the sage grouse management area;(e)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any deposits of energyand mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold,uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist inthese zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in thesezones; and(f)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any recreationresources, including wildlife, roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use,sightseeing, canyoneering, hunting, fishing, and hiking resources that may exist in thesegrazing zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in thesegrazing zones.(5)  The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2) that thehistoric levels of grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection (4) in each zonehave greatly diminished, or are under other serious threat, due to:(a)  unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies,including:(i)  de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non-WSAs;(ii)  ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interiorapplicable to each of these zones; and(iii)  the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage;(b)  inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each yearproven to be most effective for reducing and enhancing rangeland conditions;(c)  mismanagement of the wildlife resulting in competition for forage by excess andmismanaged populations of wildlife;(d)  mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage byexcess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery Counties;(e)  improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion, invasivespecies, and juniper, and other woody vegetation that:(i)  crowd out grazing forage;(ii)  reduce water yield; and(iii)  heighten the risk of catastrophic wildfire; and(f)  other practices which degrade overall rangeland health.(6)  To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection (5), the statesupports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2):(a)  efficient and responsible full development, within each grazing zone, of:(i)  all permitted existing and future grazing resources; and(ii)  other uses compatible with grazing activities, including flexible grazing on and offdates adaptive to yearly climate and range conditions;(b)  a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and localgovernment agencies to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development,within each grazing zone, of:(i)  all grazing resources; and(ii)  other uses compatible with grazing activities; and(c)  effective and responsible management of wildlife and wild horses and burros toeliminate excess populations.(7)  The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within eachgrazing zone:(a)  fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties withinwhich each grazing zone is situated, to develop, amend, and implement land and resourcemanagement plans, and implement management decisions that are consistent with thepurposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed underfederal law;(b)  expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of grazing permits, rangeimprovements, and applications to enhance and otherwise develop all existing and permittedgrazing resources located within each grazing zone, including renewable vegetative resources;(c)  allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines,pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policiesdescribed in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles;(d)  refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine,restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for each grazing zone as stated in thissection; and(e)  subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), refrain from implementing a policy that is contraryto the goals and purposes described within this section.(8)  The Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife Resources, Division ofForestry, Fire, and State Lands, and Department of Agriculture and Food shall coordinate witheach other, with counties where the zones described in Subsection (2) are situated, and withapplicable federal agencies to develop, amend, and implement policies and managementdecisions that are consistent with the purposes, goals, and policies described in this section.(9) (a)  The state recognizes the importance of all grazing districts on Utah BLM andforest service lands but establishes the grazing zones described in Subsection (2) to providespecial protection and preservation against the identified threats found in Subsection (5) toexist in these zones.(b)  It is the intent of the state to designate additional grazing agricultural commodityzones in future years, if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation for newzones.(10)  The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate witheach other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membershipconsisting of representatives from the United States government, the state, and localgovernments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and managementactions in zones described in Subsection (2) in order to achieve the goals, purposes, andpolicies described in this section.(11)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and subject to Subsection(4)(d)(ii), the state's mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies and plans on land within the zonesdescribed in Subsection (2) shall be governed by Sections

and(iv)  the arbitrary administrative reductions in timber, logging, and forest productsactivities;(b)  improper management of forest vegetation resulting in the overcrowding of oldgrowth alpine species and the crowding out of aspen diversity, all of which results in:(i)  devastation of entire mountainsides due to insect infestation and disease;(ii)  reduced water yield;(iii)  increased catastrophic wildfire;(iv)  increased soil erosion;(v)  degradation of wildlife habitat;

847

    
historic levels of grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection (4) in each zone
