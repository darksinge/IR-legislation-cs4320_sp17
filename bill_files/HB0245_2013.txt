    (2) (a)  The enforcing authority may bring a class action on behalf of consumers for the
            
236

by the enforcing authority under Subsection 

13-11-8

(2) before the consumer transactions on
            
238

    
which the action is based, or declared to violate Section 

13-11-4

 or 

13-11-5

 by final judgment
            
239

    
of courts of general jurisdiction and appellate courts of this state that was either reported
            
240

    
officially or made available for public dissemination under Subsection 

13-11-7

(1)(c) by the
            
241

    
enforcing authority 10 days before the consumer transactions on which the action is based, or,

    (b) (i)  On motion of the enforcing authority and without bond in an action under this

            
245


    
Subsection (2), the court may make appropriate orders, including appointment of a master or
            
246

    
receiver or sequestration of assets, but only if it appears that the defendant is threatening or is
            
247

    
about to remove, conceal, or dispose of the defendant's property to the damage of persons for
            
248

    
whom relief is requested.  An appropriate order may include an order:

consumers who cannot be located with due diligence shall be transferred to the state treasurer

pursuant to Title 67, Chapter 4a, Unclaimed Property Act.
            
259

    
    (d)  If a supplier shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of this
            
260

    
chapter resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures
            
261

    
reasonably adapted to avoid the error, recovery under this Subsection (2) is limited to the
            
262

    
amount, if any, by which the supplier was unjustly enriched by the violation.

266

    
class action upon acceptance of the supplier's written assurance of voluntary compliance with
            
267

268

    
consumers or take other appropriate corrective action.
            
269

    
    (b)  An assurance is not evidence of a prior violation of this chapter.  Unless an
            
270

    
assurance has been rescinded by agreement of the parties or voided by a court for good cause,
            
271

    
subsequent failure to comply with the terms of an assurance is prima facie evidence of a
            
272

    
violation.
            
273

    
    (4) (a)  In addition to other penalties and remedies set out under this chapter, and in

an administrative fine, the supplier on whom the fine is imposed shall pay the fine in full.
            
282

    
    (b)  The unpaid amount of a fine is increased by 10%:

    (ii)  unless the division waives the 10% increase in a stipulated payment plan.
