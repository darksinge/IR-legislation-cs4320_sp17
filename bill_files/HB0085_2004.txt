of this section, establish it is in the child victim's best interest that the defendant not be
            
76

    
imprisoned, by presenting evidence provided by a treatment professional who:
            
77

    
    (i)  is treating the child victim and understands he will be treating the family as a whole;

89

    (3) (a)  The Department of Corrections shall develop qualification criteria for the
            
91

    
approval of the sexual abuse treatment programs and professionals under this section.  The
            
92

    
criteria shall include the screening criteria employed by the department for sexual offenders.
            
93

    
    (b)  The sexual abuse treatment program shall be at least one year in duration, shall be
            
94

95

    
convicted.
            
96

    
    (4)  Establishment by the defendant of all the criteria of this section does not mandate

the granting under this section of probation or modification of the sentence that would
            
98

    
otherwise be imposed by Section 

76-3-406

 regarding sexual offenses against children.  The
            
99

    
court has discretion to deny the request based upon its consideration of the circumstances of the

offense, including:
            
101

    
    (a)  the nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct;

public and specifically to children.
            
106

    
    (5)  The defendant has the burden to establish by a preponderance of evidence
            
107

    
eligibility under all of the criteria of this section.
            
108

    
    (6)  If the court finds a defendant granted probation under this section fails to cooperate
            
109

    
or succeed in treatment or violates probation to any substantial degree, the sentence previously
            
110

    
imposed for the offense shall be immediately executed.
            
111

    
    (7)  The court shall enter written findings of fact regarding the conditions established by
            
112

    
the defendant that justify the granting of probation under this section.
            
113

    
    (8)  In cases involving conviction of any sexual offense against a child other than those
            
114

    
offenses provided in Subsection (1), the court shall consider the circumstances described in
            
115

    
Subsection (1) as advisory in determining whether or not execution of sentence should be
            
116

    
suspended and probation granted.  The defendant is not required to satisfy all of those
            
117

    
circumstances for eligibility pursuant to this Subsection (8).
