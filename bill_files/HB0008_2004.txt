86

    
benefits payable shall be determined in the case of any otherwise eligible claimant who, within
            
87

    
a week or other period of unemployment, is separated from or secures work on a regular
            
88

    
attachment basis for that portion of the week or other period of unemployment occurring before

90

    (6)  The division shall, in all cases involving actual or potential disqualifying issues and
            
95
