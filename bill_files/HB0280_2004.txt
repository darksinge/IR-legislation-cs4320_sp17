 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-2-04  11:07 AM

This legislation authorizes a Respect Choice special group license plate.  This legislation might
be challenged on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has not decided a case addressing the issuance
of special group license plates. However, at least one federal district court has held that the
issuance of a special plate constitutes private speech that is unconstitutional viewpoint
discrimination if the license plate is issued pursuant to the uncontrolled discretion of the
legislature.  Planned Parenthood v. Rose, 236 F. Supp. 2d 564 (D.S.C. 2002);  See also, Sons
of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles,
288 F.3d 610 (4th Cir. 2002).

This legislation also requires a contribution of at least $25 annually to Respect Choice, Inc., a
private non-profit entity, in order to purchase a Respect Choice special group license plate. 
Article VI, Section 26 of the Utah Constitution prohibits special legislation.  The Utah
Supreme Court has defined special legislation as legislation that classifies its objects
unreasonably, by selecting from a class of particular persons, places, or things for the purpose
of conferring privileges or imposing burdens. It is unclear whether a court would determine
that requiring a contribution of at least $25 annually to Respect Choice, Inc., if a person
chooses to purchase a Respect Choice special group license plate, is unconstitutional special
legislation.  If a court finds that the classification is reasonable and that general legislation is
unable to cover the same issues that the special legislation covers, a court would likely uphold
the Legislature's action.
