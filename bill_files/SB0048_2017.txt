Nurse Licensure Compact.40          The Nurse Licensure Compact is hereby enacted and entered into with all other41     jurisdictions that legally join in the compact, which is in form, substantially as follows:42     NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT43     ARTICLE I44     Findings and Declaration of Purpose45          a. The party states find that:46          1.  The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and47     the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws;48          2.  Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may49     result in injury or harm to the public;50          3.  The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication51     technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and52     cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;53          4.  New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state54     nurse licensure laws difficult and complex;55          5.  The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is56     cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and57          6.  Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public58     safety and public health benefits.59          b.  The general purposes of this Compact are to:60          1.  Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and safety;61          2.  Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure62     and regulation;63          3.  Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse64     regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;65          4.  Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each66     jurisdiction;67          5.  Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all68     state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered69     through the mutual recognition of party state licenses;70          6.  Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses; and71          7.  Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure72     requirements.73     ARTICLE II74     Definitions75          As used in this Compact:76          a.

"Current significant investigative information" means:89          1.  Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that90     includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has91     reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor92     infraction; or93          2.  Investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat94     to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an95     opportunity to respond.96          e.  "Encumbrance" means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full97     and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.98          f.

A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of127     applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall128     include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for129     the purpose of obtaining an applicant's criminal history record information from the Federal130     Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state's criminal records.131          c.

All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with existing state due process160     law, to take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation,161     suspension, probation, or any other action that affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a162     multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such163     action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information164     system.

The practice of nursing is not168     limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing practice as defined by the state practice169     laws of the party state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing in a party state170     under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing171     board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time172     service is provided.173          f.  Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party174     state's single-state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the175     single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege176     to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the177     requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license.178          g.  Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of this179     Compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home180     state, provided that:181          1.  A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this Compact's effective date,182     must meet all applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a multistate license from a new183     home state; and184          2.  A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Article III.c. due185     to a disqualifying event occurring after this Compact's effective date shall be ineligible to retain186     or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated187     in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure188     Compact Administrators ("Commission").189     ARTICLE IV190     Applications for Licensure in a Party State191          a.  Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party192     state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the193     applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are194     any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant,195     whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege196     held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative197     program.198          b.  A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party199     state at a time.200          c.  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states,201     the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by202     the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the203     Commission.204          1.  The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of205     residence.206          2.  A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse207     provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state208     and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.209          d.  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a210     non-party state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a211     single-state license, valid only in the former home state.212     ARTICLE V213     Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards214          a.  In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have215     the authority to:216          1.  Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice within217     that party state.218          i.  Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse's219     license issued by the home state.220          ii.  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the221     same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such222     conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own223     state laws to determine appropriate action.224          2.  Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse's authority to225     practice within that party state.226          3.  Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes primary state of227     residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the228     authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such229     investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The230     administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new231     home state of any such actions.232          4.  Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and233     testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing234     board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of235     evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent236     jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas237     issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel238     expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the239     witnesses or evidence are located.240          5.  Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other241     biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background242     checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal243     background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions.244          6.  If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of245     investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that246     nurse.247          7.  Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that248     the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.249          b.  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate license, the250     nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated251     until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state252     disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license shall include253     a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during254     the pendency of the order.255          c.  Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an256     alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall257     deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the258     duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program.259     ARTICLE VI260     Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information261          a.  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all262     licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). This263     system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as264     submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement265     efforts.266          b.  The Commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure267     information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification,268     collection, and exchange of information under this Compact.269          c.  All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information270     system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of271     applications (with the reasons for such denials), and nurse participation in alternative programs272     known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or273     confidential under state law.274          d.  Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or275     confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure276     information system only to party state licensing boards.277          e.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards278     contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate279     information that may not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or280     individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.281          f.  Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure282     information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or283     disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party284     state contributing the information.285          g.  Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is286     subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that287     information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.288          h.  The Compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the289     Compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:290          1.  Identifying information;291          2.  Licensure data;292          3.  Information related to alternative program participation; and293          4.  Other information that may facilitate the administration of this Compact, as294     determined by Commission rules.295          i.  The Compact administrator of a party state shall provide all investigative documents296     and information requested by another party state.297     ARTICLE VII298     Establishment of the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators299          a.  The party states hereby create and establish a joint public entity known as the300     Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators.301          1.  The Commission is an instrumentality of the party states.302          2.  Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be303     brought solely and exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office304     of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to305     the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.306          3.  Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.307          b.  Membership, Voting, and Meetings308          1.  Each party state shall have and be limited to one administrator. The head of the state309     licensing board or designee shall be the administrator of this Compact for each party state. Any310     administrator may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state311     from which the administrator is appointed.

The Commission may meet in closed session only after a majority of the360     administrators vote to close a meeting in whole or in part.

The Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses414     of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.415          2.  The Commission may also levy on and collect an annual assessment from each party416     state to cover the cost of its operations, activities, and staff in its annual budget as approved417     each year.

The Commission shall defend any administrator, officer, executive director,440     employee, or representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability441     arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of442     Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim443     is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission444     employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to445     prohibit that person from retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further that the actual446     or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that person's intentional, willful, or wanton447     misconduct.448          3.  The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any administrator, officer,449     executive director, employee, or representative of the Commission for the amount of any450     settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act,451     error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or452     responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the453     scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or454     alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct455     of that person.456     ARTICLE VIII457     Rulemaking458          a.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set459     forth in this Article and the rules adopted thereunder.

Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of463     the Commission.464          c.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at465     least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted466     upon, the Commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:467          1.  On the website of the Commission; and468          2.  On the website of each licensing board or the publication in which each state would469     otherwise publish proposed rules.470          d. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:471          1.  The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be472     considered and voted upon;473          2.  The text of the proposed rule or amendment, and the reason for the proposed rule;474          3.  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and475          4.  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of476     their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.477          e.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit478     written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.479          f.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a480     rule or amendment.481          g.  The Commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public482     hearing.483          1.  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to484     comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing. All hearings will485     be recorded, and a copy will be made available upon request.486          2.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each487     rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this488     section.489          h.  If no one appears at the public hearing, the Commission may proceed with490     promulgation of the proposed rule.491          i.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled492     hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral493     comments received.494          j.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take final action on the495     proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking496     record and the full text of the rule.497          k.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and498     adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided499     that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall be500     retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety501     (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency502     rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:503          1.  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;504          2.  Prevent a loss of Commission or party state funds; or505          3.  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is required by506     federal law or rule.507          l. The Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for508     purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or509     grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the510     Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30)511     days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in512     a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the513     Commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will514     take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect515     without the approval of the Commission.516     ARTICLE IX517     Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement518          a.  Oversight519          1.  Each party state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and520     appropriate to effectuate this Compact's purposes and intent.521          2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding that522     may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission, and shall have standing523     to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such524     proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this525     Compact, or promulgated rules.526          b.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination527          1.  If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the performance of528     its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission529     shall:530          i.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other party states of the nature of531     the default, the proposed means of curing the default, or any other action to be taken by the532     Commission; and533          ii.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.534          2.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's membership in this535     Compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and536     all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the537     effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of538     obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.539          3.  Termination of membership in this Compact shall be imposed only after all other540     means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate541     shall be given by the Commission to the governor of the defaulting state and to the executive542     officer of the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the party states.543          4.  A state whose membership in this Compact has been terminated is responsible for544     all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination,545     including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.546          5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in547     default or whose membership in this Compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in548     writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.549          6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the550     U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission551     has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,552     including reasonable attorneys' fees.553          c.  Dispute Resolution554          1.  Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes555     related to the Compact that arise among party states and between party and non-party states.556          2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding557     dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.558          3.  In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes among party states arising559     under this Compact:560          i.  The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitration panel, which will561     be comprised of individuals appointed by the Compact administrator in each of the affected562     party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the Compact administrators of all the563     party states involved in the dispute.564          ii.  The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final and binding.565          d.  Enforcement566          1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the567     provisions and rules of this Compact.568          2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court569     for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission has its principal570     offices against a party state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this571     Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive572     relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be573     awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.574          3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The575     Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.576     ARTICLE X577     Effective Date, Withdrawal, and Amendment578          a.  This Compact, enacted in Title 58, Chapter 31e, Nurse Licensure Compact - Revised579     ("This Compact"), shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date of legislative580     enactment of this Compact into law by no less than twenty-six (26) states or December 31,581     2018. All party states to this Compact, that also were parties to the prior Nurse Licensure582     Compact, enacted in Title 58, Chapter 31c, Nurse Licensure Compact, superseded by this583     Compact, ("Prior Compact"), shall be deemed to have withdrawn from said Prior Compact584     within six (6) months after the effective date of this Compact.585          b.  Each party state to this Compact shall continue to recognize a nurse's multistate586     licensure privilege to practice in that party state issued under the Prior Compact until such587     party state has withdrawn from the Prior Compact.588          c.  Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the589     same. A party state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the590     repealing statute.591          d.  A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing requirement592     of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing board to report adverse actions and593     significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or594     termination.595          e.  Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any596     nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a597     non-party state that is made in accordance with the other provisions of this Compact.598          f.  This Compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this Compact599     shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is enacted into the600     laws of all party states.601          g.  Representatives of non-party states to this Compact shall be invited to participate in602     the activities of the Commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the adoption of this Compact603     by all states.604     ARTICLE XI605     Construction and Severability606          This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The607     provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision608     of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United609     States, or if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held610     invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any611     government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact612     shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this Compact shall remain in613     full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party614     state affected as to all severable matters.615          Section 3.  Section 58-31e-103 is enacted to read:616          58-31e-103. Implementation and rulemaking authority.617          (1)  The term "head of the state licensing board," as used in Article VII b(1) of the618     Nurse Licensure Compact in Section 58-31e-102, means an individual who is an ex-officio619     member of the Board of Nursing created in Section 58-31b-201 and is appointed by the director620     to serve as the head of the state licensing board for purposes of Article VII b(1) of the Nurse621     Licensure Compact.622          (2)  The division may, in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative623     Rulemaking Act, make rules necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter.
