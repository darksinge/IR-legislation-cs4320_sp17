 Legislative Review Note
    as of   1-29-04  3:06 PM


This bill regulates, among other things, the sending of certain commercial email messages to
addresses contained on a registry. Congress recently passed the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 that,
with some exemptions, preempts a state from regulating commercial email. The act permits
state regulations of commercial email that:
        .    prohibit falsity or deception;
           .    are not specific to email; or
           .    relate to acts of fraud or computer crime.
   If this bill were challenged, a court would evaluate whether this bill falls into one of those
exemptions.
