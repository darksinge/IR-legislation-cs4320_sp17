    and underground coal mining methods.

        (2)  Each permit [issued pursuant to this chapter and] relating to underground coal mining

    issued pursuant to this chapter shall require the operator to[:] comply with this section.

        (3)  (a)  [Adopt] Except in those instances where the mining technology used requires

    planned subsidence in a predictable and controlled manner, the operator shall adopt measures

    consistent with known technology [in order] to:

        (i)  prevent subsidence from causing material damage, to the extent technologically and

    economically feasible[,];


        (ii)  maximize mine stability[,]; and

        (iii)  maintain the value and reasonably foreseeable use of the surface lands[, except in those

    instances where the mining technology used requires planned subsidence in a predictable and

    controlled manner; but nothing].

        (b)  Nothing in Subsection [(2)] (3)(a) shall be construed to prohibit the standard method of

    room and pillar mining.

        [(b)  Seal] (4)  The operator shall seal all portals, entryways, drifts, shafts, or other openings

    between the surface and underground mine working when no longer needed for the conduct of the

    mining operations.

        [(c)  Fill] (5)  The operator shall fill or seal exploratory holes no longer necessary for

    mining, maximizing to the extent technologically and economically feasible, the return of mine and

    workings or excavations.

        [(d)] (6) (a)  With respect to surface disposal of mine wastes, tailings, coal processing

    wastes, and other wastes in areas other than the mine workings or excavations, the operator shall

    stabilize all waste piles created [by the permittee] from current operations through construction in

    compacted layers, including the use of incombustible and impervious materials, if necessary[, and].

        (b)  The operator shall assure that:

        (i)  the leachate will not degrade surface or ground waters below water quality standards

    established pursuant to applicable federal and state law [surface or ground waters and that];

        (ii)  the final contour of the waste accumulation will be compatible with natural

    surroundings; and [that]

        (iii)  the site is stabilized and revegetated according to the provisions of this section.

        [(e)  Design] (7) In accordance with the standards and criteria developed pursuant to Section

    40-10-17, the operator shall design, locate, construct, operate, maintain, enlarge, modify, and

    remove or abandon [in accordance with the standards and criteria developed pursuant to Section

    40-10-17] all existing and new coal mine waste piles consisting of mine wastes, tailings, coal

    processing wastes, or other liquid and solid wastes that are used either temporarily or permanently

- 2 -


    as dams or embankments.

        [(f)  Establish] (8)  The operator shall establish on regraded areas and all other lands

    affected, a diverse and permanent vegetative cover that is:

        (a)  capable of self-regeneration and plant succession; and

        (b)  at least equal in extent of cover to the natural vegetation of the area.

        [(g)  Protect] (9)  The operator shall protect offsite areas from damages which may result

    from the mining operations.

        [(h)  Eliminate] (10)  The operator shall eliminate fire hazards and [otherwise eliminate] 

    other conditions which constitute a hazard to health and safety of the public.

        [(i)  Minimize] (11)  The operator shall minimize the disturbances of the prevailing

    hydrologic balance at the mine site and in associated offsite areas and to the quantity of water in

    surface and groundwater systems both during and after coal mining operations and during

    reclamation by:

        [(i)] (a)  avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by such measures as, but not limited to:

        [(A)] (i)  preventing or removing water from contact with toxic-producing deposits;

        [(B)] (ii)  treating drainage to reduce toxic content which adversely affects downstream

    water upon being released to water courses; or

        [(C)] (iii)  casing, sealing, or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, and wells to keep acid

    or other toxic drainage from entering ground and surface waters[.];

        [(ii)] (b)  conducting surface coal mining operations [so as] to prevent, to the extent possible

    using the best technology currently available, additional contributions of suspended solids to

    streamflow or runoff outside the permit area [(], but in no event shall these contributions be in

    excess of requirements set by applicable state or federal law[),]; and

        (c)  avoiding channel deepening or enlargement in operations requiring the discharge of

    water from mines.

        [(j)  With respect to other surface impacts not specified in Subsection (2), including]

        (12) (a)  The standards established under Section 40-10-17 for surface coal mining
