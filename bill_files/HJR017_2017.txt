Christensen8      9     LONG TITLE10     General Description:11          This joint resolution of the Legislature urges the President of the United States and12     Congress to recognize state authority and take action to restore power to the states.13     Highlighted Provisions:14          This resolution:15                calls upon the President of the United States to reenact President Ronald Reagan's16     Executive Order 12612 and to create a national commission on federalism;17                urges Congress to pass and adhere to the Enumerated Powers Act;18                urges Congress to pass the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act;19                urges Congress to pass the Intergenerational Financial Obligations Reform Act;20                urges Congress to direct the Government Accountability Office to conduct an audit21     of federal programs, rules, regulations, and laws that have federalism implications;22                demands that all branches of the federal government refrain from any activity that23     limits the policymaking discretion of the states; and24                encourages other states to join with the state of Utah in documenting issues of25     federal overreach.26     Special Clauses:27          None28      29     Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:30          WHEREAS, the genius of the United States of America lies in the liberty of our people31     to govern ourselves at the most local level, to solve our unique problems, to foster prosperity32     through our liberty, and to cultivate our unique endowment of human, capital, and natural33     resources;34          WHEREAS, America's unique structure of government known as federalism, secures35     the local voice and liberty of the people through clear divisions of responsibility between state36     and federal governments, as explained in Federalist 51, "the power surrendered by the people is37     ... divided between two distinct governments"-state and national;38          WHEREAS, the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution establishes the39     overarching theory and structure of our constitutional form of government to protect the40     people's liberty by stating, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,41     nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people";42          WHEREAS, former Utah Governor Scott Matheson stated "Federalism is neither a43     partisan issue, nor is it an issue dividing liberals and conservatives. It's a philosophical concept44     of how the federal governmental system operates, an effort to determine the proper role of state45     and federal governments";46          WHEREAS, James Madison, the primary author of the Constitution, described these47     clear and certain constitutional divisions of responsibility most plainly in Federalist 45, saying48     the powers delegated to the national government are "few and defined," over primarily49     "external objects," and clarified that the powers reserved to the states concern "the lives,50     liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of51     the State," and are "numerous and indefinite" (Federalist 45);52          WHEREAS, in Federalist 47, Madison warned the "accumulation of all powers,53     legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands ... may justly be pronounced the very54     definition of tyranny," and the power delegated through the executive branch to unelected,55     unaccountable federal bureaucrats who make, enforce, and adjudicate their own rules, as if they56     were laws, fits the definition of tyranny that Madison described;57          WHEREAS, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts stated "If no enumerated58     power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it would59     not violate any of the express prohibitions in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the60     Constitution" Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2577 (2012);61          WHEREAS, absent a clear and certain division of responsibility between state and62     national governments, the structure of federalism is undermined and the resulting power63     vacuum is, by nature, filled by the government with the most accumulated power;64          WHEREAS, throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, regulations, laws, executive65     orders, and court rulings emanating from the federal government have proliferated, and have66     been met by agreement, acquiescence, or inaction of the states, which has blurred the divisions67     of responsibility between the federal government and the states, resulting in a power vacuum68     that has further distorted the constitutional divisions, separations, and limits on the "few and69     defined" powers constitutionally delegated to the national government;70          WHEREAS, James Madison wisely noted, "There are more instances of the71     abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in72     power than by violent and sudden usurpations";73          WHEREAS, the assumption of power that was never delegated to the federal74     government under the Constitution undermines the constitutional architecture of federalism75     instituted to "secure to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power"76     Bond v. United States, 564 U.S. 211, 221 (2011);77          WHEREAS, "The structure of our government is central to liberty, and when we78     destroy it, we place liberty at peril" Nat.l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566,79     2676-77 (2012) (Scalia, Thomas, Kennedy, and Alito dissenting);80          WHEREAS, any activity that undermines the core federalism structure of our81     government also erodes the voice and liberty of the people in determining the destiny,82     opportunity, creativity, and dynamism of their own lives and their unique communities and83     states-to the detriment of the nation as a whole;84          WHEREAS, on October 26, 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order85     12612 on federalism "to restore the division of governmental responsibilities between the86     national government and the States that was intended by the Framers of the Constitution and to87     ensure that the principles of federalism established by the Framers guide the Executive88     departments and agencies in the formulation and implementation of policies";89          WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump declared in his 2017 Inaugural Address, "we90     are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to91     another-but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the92     American People";93          WHEREAS, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and94     Government Reform, has reached out to state legislatures around the country to document their95     experiences with federal overreach and unfunded mandates with a view to restoring power to96     the states and to the people;97          WHEREAS, in 2013, the Utah Legislature established the Utah Commission on98     Federalism (the Commission) to: assess overreaching federal actions; respond to actions99     through a measured dispute resolution process; coordinate with Utah's congressional delegation100     and with other states; and report actions and results to the Legislature;101          WHEREAS, at the request of Utah Senate President Wayne Niederhauser and Utah102     Speaker of the House of Representatives Greg Hughes, the Commission convened public103     hearings throughout the 2017 legislative session to receive reports from the various Senate and104     House standing and appropriation committee chairs, state officials, staff, and members of the105     public concerning federal actions that constitute examples of federal overreach, erode the106     structural guarantees of federalism, or restrain the right and liberty of our people to govern107     ourselves;108          WHEREAS, the Commission received the following summary of federal overreach:109          EDUCATION110            Recognize that education is not a power delegated to the federal government under the111     Constitution, it is reserved to the states;112            Abolish the United States Department of Education and block grant administration113     costs and federal appropriations to the state;114            Repeal the mandates of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and115            Relax the overly expansive interpretation of federal regulations, which increase costs116     and adversely affects education at all levels;117          PUBLIC LANDS AND NATURAL RESOURCES118            Recognize and abide by the comprehensive federal study and 1962 General Services119     Administration Inventory Report on Jurisdictional Status of Federal areas within the States that120     concluded that the national government has no jurisdiction but merely a proprietorial interest121     over the vast majority of public lands within Utah;122            Repay to the state the nearly $1 million appropriated by the Utah Legislature in 2013123     to reopen the national parks, and forever refrain from closing or withdrawing public lands,124     without the consent of the Legislature.125            Relinquish control over public lands within the state of Utah consistent with the equal126     sovereignty and equal footing enjoyed by all other states;127            Acquire no new land within the state without the express consent of a state legislature128     (United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Cl. 17);129            Amend the Antiquities Act, 54 U.S.C. Sec. 320301, to require consent of a state130     legislature for any national monument designation;131            Recognize, restore, and respect state jurisdiction over free-roaming horses and burros,132     livestock management, wildlife, and wildlife management within the state, and provide state133     control over the use of federal funds for these purposes;134            Perform and finalize the maintenance backlog in the national parks, national135     monuments, national forests, congressionally designated wilderness areas, and congressionally136     designated wilderness study areas;137            Mitigate catastrophic fire risk on national forests and rangelands.138            Reinstate land use plans, policies, and practices that require public land management139     for multiple use and sustained yield consistent with local resource management plans.140            Restrict the Secretary of the Interior's broad discretion over coal, mineral, oil, and gas141     reservations, deferrals, and moratoriums;142            Revoke the United States Fish and Wildlife Service sage-grouse land use plans in143     favor of Utah's sage-grouse management plan that maintains or increases the animal's144     population within the state;145            Authorize and conduct a full Government Accountability Office audit of all legal fee146     awards under the Equal Access to Justice Act and revise the act to require full disclosure and147     transparency, as was sought in the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act, which would148     require an annual report to Congress from the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of149     the United States, would describe the number, nature, and amount of the awards and the claims150     involved, and would be made available to the public;151            Authorize and conduct a full Government Accountability Office audit of the "sue and152     settle" court decisions that established new management criteria for public lands, and overrule153     all decisions lacking express ratification by Congress;154            End the federal prosecution of the Revised Statute 2477 road litigation and recognize155     state and county authority of Revised Statute 2477 roads over public lands as established since156     1866 and reaffirmed in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976; and157            Repeal Bureau of Land Management Planning 2.0 rule, which shifts most public land158     use and planning decisions to Washington D.C., and away from local officials and managers on159     the ground;160          HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES161            Recognize, restore, and respect the jurisdiction of the state over "the conduct of public162     utilities, of banks, of insurance, of business, of agriculture, of education, of social welfare,"163     which "have not been surrendered to the national government by the Constitution, or its164     amendments" Gov.

The result is that federalism seems like a quaint concept. What's dangerous262     about that is it's a protection of individual liberty. The degree to which people become passive263     about the increasing power of the federal government, they can watch the greatest protection of264     their individual liberty simply dissipate".265          NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah266     echoes the warning of Justice Anthony Kennedy that the increasing assumption and267     centralization of power to the national government is destroying the federalism structure of our268     government and placing the liberty of our people "at peril."269          BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah calls on270     President Donald J.
