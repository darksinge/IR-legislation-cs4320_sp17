with Section 

31A-22-413

.
            
97

    
    [(3)] (4)  A severance under Subsection (2)(b) does not affect any third-party interest in
            
98

    
property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the
            
99

102

    
evidence of ownership.
            
103

    
    [(4)] (5)  Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse
            
104

    
and relatives of the former spouse disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the
            
105

    
case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the former spouse

    [(6)] (7)  No change of circumstances other than as described in this section and in
            
110

75-2-803

112

113

    
instrument affected by a divorce, annulment, or remarriage, or for having taken any other
            
114

    
action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument, before the payor or
            
115

    
other third party received written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage.  A payor or
            
116

    
other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third
            
117

    
party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.
            
118

    
    (b)  Written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage under Subsection [(7)]

120

    
certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the

            
121


    
same manner as a summons in a civil action.  Upon receipt of written notice of the divorce,
            
122

    
annulment, or remarriage, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or
            
123

    
deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate
            
124

    
proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or
            
125

    
with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estates
            
126

    
located in the county of the decedent's residence.  The court shall hold the funds or item of
            
127

    
property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement or transfer in
            
128

    
accordance with the determination.  Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court
            
129

    
discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or
            
130

    
items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.
            
131

    
    [(8)] (9) (a)  A person who purchases property from a former spouse, relative of a
            
132

    
former spouse, or any other person for value and without notice, or who receives from a former
            
133

    
spouse, relative of a former spouse, or any other person a payment or other item of property in
            
134

section to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, nor is liable under this section for
            
136

    
the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit.  But a former spouse,
            
137

    
relative of a former spouse, or other person who, not for value, received a payment, item of
            
138

    
property, or any other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated

140

    
payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under
            
141

    
this section.
            
142

    
    (b)  If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to
            
143

    
a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered by this section, a former spouse,
            
144

    
relative of the former spouse, or any other person who, not for value, received a payment, item
            
145

    
of property, or any other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is
            
146

    
obligated to return that payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the
            
147

    
amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would
            
148

    
have been entitled to it were this section or part of this section not preempted.
