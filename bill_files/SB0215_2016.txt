Section 31A-22-305.3 is amended to read:26          31A-22-305.3. Underinsured motorist coverage.27          (1)  As used in this section:28          (a)  "Covered person" has the same meaning as defined in Section 31A-22-305.29          (b) (i)  "Underinsured motor vehicle" includes a motor vehicle, the operation,30     maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time of an injury-causing31     occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the injured party32     for all special and general damages.33          (ii)  The term "underinsured motor vehicle" does not include:34          (A)  a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same policy that35     also contains the underinsured motorist coverage;36          (B)  an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection 31A-22-305(2); or37          (C)  a motor vehicle owned or leased by:38          (I)  a named insured;39          (II)  a named insured's spouse; or40          (III)  a dependent of a named insured.41          (2) (a)  Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection 31A-22-302(1)(c) provides42     coverage for a covered person who is legally entitled to recover damages from an owner or43     operator of an underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.44          (b)  A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or furnished45     to the covered person, the covered person's spouse, or covered person's resident relative may46     recover underinsured benefits only if the motor vehicle is:47          (i)  described in the policy under which a claim is made; or48          (ii)  a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the49     policy.50          (3) (a)  For purposes of this Subsection (3), "new policy" means:51          (i)  any policy that is issued that does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an52     existing policy; or53          (ii)  a change to an existing policy that results in:54          (A)  a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy; or55          (B)  a change in the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage.56          [(a)] (b)  For new policies written on or after January 1, 2001, the limits of underinsured57     motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle58     liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the59     insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy, unless a named insured rejects or60     purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form that:61          (i)  is filed with the department;62          (ii)  is provided by the insurer;63          (iii)  waives the higher coverage;64          (iv)  need only state in this or similar language that "underinsured motorist coverage65     provides benefits or protection to you and other covered persons for bodily injury resulting66     from an accident caused by the fault of another party where the other party has insufficient67     liability insurance"; and68          (v)  discloses the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist69     coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle70     liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the71     insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.72          [(b)] (c)  Any selection or rejection under Subsection (3)[(a)](b) continues for that73     issuer of the liability coverage until the insured requests, in writing, a change of underinsured74     motorist coverage from that liability insurer.75          [(c)] (d) (i)  Subsections (3)[(a)](b) and [(b)] (c) apply retroactively to any claim arising76     on or after January 1, 2001, for which, as of May 14, 2013, an insured has not made a written77     demand for arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.78          (ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsections (3)[(a)](b) and79     [(b)] (c) clarifies legislative intent and does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights.80          [(d)  For purposes of this Subsection (3), "new policy" means:]81          [(i)  any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an82     existing policy; or]83          [(ii)  a change to an existing policy that results in:]84          [(A)  a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy; or]85          [(B)  a change in the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle liability coverage.]86          (e) (i)  As used in this Subsection (3)(e), "additional motor vehicle" means a change87     that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include88     replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.89          (ii)  The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or90     commercial lines policy does not constitute a new policy for purposes of Subsection (3)[(d)](a).91          (iii)  If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where92     underinsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where underinsured motorist limits are93     lower than the named insured's motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice94     to a named insured within 30 days that:95          (A)  in the same manner described in Subsection (3)[(a)](b)(iv), explains the purpose of96     underinsured motorist coverage; and97          (B)  encourages the named insured to contact the insurance company or insurance98     producer for quotes as to the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist99     coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle100     liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the101     insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.102          (f)  A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under103     Subsection (3)[(d)](a)(ii) does not constitute a new policy.104          (g) (i)  Subsection (3)[(d)](a) applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after105     January 1, 2001 for which, as of May 1, 2012, an insured has not made a written demand for106     arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.107          (ii)  The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection (3)[(d)](a):108          (A)  does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights; and109          (B)  clarifies legislative intent.110          (h)  A self-insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide underinsured111     motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self-insured retention under112     Subsections (3)[(a)](b) and (l) by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement from113     the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the:114          (i)  self-insured entity's coverage level; and115          (ii)  process for filing an underinsured motorist claim.116          (i)  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than:117          (i)  $10,000 for one person in any one accident; and118          (ii)  at least $20,000 for two or more persons in any one accident.119          (j)  An acknowledgment under Subsection (3)[(a)](b) continues for that issuer of the120     underinsured motorist coverage until the named insured, in writing, requests different121     underinsured motorist coverage from the insurer.122          (k) (i)  The named insured's underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection123     (2), is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motor124     vehicle, as described in Subsection (1).125          (ii)  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage of126     the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with,127     or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motor128     vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.129          (l) (i)  In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January 1, 2001, for130     policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium131     renewal notice, an explanation of:132          (A)  the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage in the same manner as described in133     Subsection (3)[(a)](b)(iv); and134          (B)  a disclosure of the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist135     coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured's motor vehicle136     liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the137     insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.138          (ii)  The disclosure required under this Subsection (3)(l) shall be sent to all named139     insureds that carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the named140     insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage141     limits available by the insurer under the named insured's motor vehicle policy.142          (m)  For purposes of this Subsection (3), a notice or disclosure sent to a named insured143     in a household constitutes notice or disclosure to all insureds within the household.144          (4) (a) (i)  Except as provided in this Subsection (4), a covered person injured in a145     motor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not elect146     to collect underinsured motorist coverage benefits from another motor vehicle insurance policy.147          (ii)  The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motor148     vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance149     coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.150          (iii)  Subsection (4)(a)(ii) applies to all persons except a covered person described151     under Subsections (4)(b)(i) and (ii).152          (b) (i)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b)(ii), a covered person injured while153     occupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to the154     covered person, the covered person's spouse, or the covered person's resident parent or resident155     sibling, may also recover benefits under any one other policy under which the covered person is156     also a covered person.157          (ii) (A)  A covered person may recover benefits from no more than two additional158     policies, one additional policy from each parent's household if the covered person is:159          (I)  a dependent minor of parents who reside in separate households; and160          (II)  injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or161     furnished to the covered person, the covered person's resident parent, or the covered person's162     resident sibling.163          (B)  Each parent's policy under this Subsection (4)(b)(ii) is liable only for the164     percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent's policy of underinsured165     motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents' underinsured coverage applicable to the166     accident.167          (iii)  A covered person's recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full168     amount of damages.169          (iv)  Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident is170     primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections171     31A-22-305(1)(a), (b), and (c) is secondary coverage.172          (v)  The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other.173          (vi)  A covered person as described under Subsection (4)(b)(i) is entitled to the highest174     limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per household175     applicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative.176          (vii)  A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections if177     recovery is unavailable under previous elections.178          (viii) (A)  As used in this section, "interpolicy stacking" means recovering benefits for a179     single incident of loss under more than one insurance policy.180          (B)  Except to the extent permitted by this Subsection (4), interpolicy stacking is181     prohibited for underinsured motorist coverage.182          (c)  Underinsured motorist coverage:183          (i)  is secondary to the benefits provided by Title 34A, Chapter 2, Workers'184     Compensation Act;185          (ii)  may not be subrogated by a workers' compensation insurance carrier;186          (iii)  may not be reduced by benefits provided by workers' compensation insurance;187          (iv)  may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person is188     made whole;189          (v)  may not be collected for bodily injury or death sustained by a person:190          (A)  while committing a violation of Section 41-1a-1314;191          (B)  who, as a passenger in a vehicle, has knowledge that the vehicle is being operated192     in violation of Section 41-1a-1314;

or197          (B)  by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section 53-13-103, who is injured198     within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer's duties.199          (5)  The inception of the loss under Subsection 31A-21-313(1) for underinsured200     motorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.201          (6) (a)  [Within] Except as provided in Subsection (6)(d), within five business days202     after notification that all liability insurers have tendered [their liability] the liability insurers'203     policy limits, the underinsured carrier shall either:204          (i)  waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the person205     liable for the injuries caused in the accident; or206          (ii)  pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability carrier.207          (b)  If neither option is exercised under Subsection (6)(a), the subrogation claim is208     considered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.209          (c)  The notification under Subsection (6)(a) shall include:210          (i)  the name, address, and phone number for all liability insurers;211          (ii)  the liability insurers' liability policy limits;

or246          (ii)  through litigation.247          (b)  Unless otherwise provided in the policy under which underinsured benefits are248     claimed, the election provided in Subsection (8)(a) is available to the claimant only, except that249     if the policy under which insured benefits are claimed provides that either an insured or the250     insurer may elect arbitration, the insured or the insurer may elect arbitration and that election to251     arbitrate shall stay the litigation of the claim under Subsection (8)(a)(ii).252          (c)  Once a claimant elects to commence litigation under Subsection (8)(a)(ii), the253     claimant may not elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration under this section254     without the written consent of the underinsured motorist coverage carrier.255          (d) (i)  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, a claim that is submitted to256     binding arbitration under Subsection (8)(a)(i) shall be resolved by a single arbitrator.257          (ii)  All parties shall agree on the single arbitrator selected under Subsection (8)(d)(i).258          (iii)  If the parties are unable to agree on a single arbitrator as required under Subsection259     (8)(d)(ii), the parties shall select a panel of three arbitrators.260          (e)  If the parties select a panel of three arbitrators under Subsection (8)(d)(iii):261          (i)  each side shall select one arbitrator; and262          (ii)  the arbitrators appointed under Subsection (8)(e)(i) shall select one additional263     arbitrator to be included in the panel.264          (f)  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing:265          (i)  each party shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator selected266     under Subsection (8)(d)(i);
