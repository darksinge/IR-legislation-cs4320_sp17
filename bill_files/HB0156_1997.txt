They have          the right to employ counsel of their own choice and if any of them requests an attorney and is          found by the court to be indigent, counsel shall be appointed by the court as provided in          Subsection    . The court may appoint counsel without a request if it considers representation by          counsel necessary to protect the interest of the minor or of other parties.               b   The cost of appointed counsel for an indigent minor or other indigent party, including          the cost of counsel and expense of appeal, shall be paid by the county in which the hearing is held.          Counties may levy and collect taxes for these purposes.                   If the county responsible to provide legal counsel for an indigent under Subsection              b  has arranged by contract to provide services, the court if it has received notice or a copy of          such contract shall appoint the contracting attorney as legal counsel to represent that indigent.

The indigent s mere preference for other counsel shall not be considered a compelling          reason justifying the appointment of a noncontracting attorney.                   The court may order a minor, parent, guardian, or custodian for whom counsel is          appointed and the parents or guardian of any minor for whom counsel is appointed to reimburse          the county for the cost of appointed counsel.                   If the minor and other parties were not represented by counsel, the court shall inform          them at the conclusion of the proceedings that they have the right to appeal.
