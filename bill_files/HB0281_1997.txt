A third party may not pay damages awarded under this chapter, or provide a defense          or money for a defense, on behalf of an insured under a contract of insurance or indemnification.                   A cause of action authorized pursuant to this section may not be assigned, either          expressly, by subrogation, or by any other means, directly or indirectly, to any public or publicly          funded agency or institution.              Section  .  Section       e   is enacted to read                     e  .  Joinder of parties.                   Two or more persons may join in one action under this chapter as plaintiffs if their          respective actions have at least one place of illegal drug activity in common and if any portion of          the period of illegal drug use overlaps with the period of illegal drug use for every other plaintiff.                   Two or more persons may be joined in one action under this chapter as defendants if          those persons are liable to at least one plaintiff.                   A plaintiff need not be interested in obtaining and a defendant need not be interested          in defending against all the relief demanded.  Judgment may be given for one or more plaintiffs          according to their respective rights to relief and against one or more defendants according to their          respective liabilities.              Section  .  Section       e   is enacted to read                     e  .  Comparative responsibility.                   An action by an individual drug user is governed by the principles of comparative          responsibility.  Comparative responsibility attributed to the plaintiff does not bar recovery but          diminishes the award of compensatory damages proportionally, according to the measure of                 responsibility attributed to the plaintiff.                  The burden of proving the comparative responsibility of the plaintiff is on the         defendant, which shall be shown by clear and convincing evidence.                  Comparative responsibility may not be applied in an action brought by a third party         who was not an individual drug user.             Section  .  Section       e   is enacted to read                    e  .  Contribution among and recovery from multiple defendants.             A person subject to liability under this chapter has a right of action for contribution against         another person subject to liability under this chapter.  Contribution may be enforced either in the          original action or by a separate action brought for that purpose.  A plaintiff may seek recovery in          accordance with this chapter and existing law against a person whom a defendant has asserted a          right of contribution.              Section   .  Section       e    is enacted to read                     e   .  Standard of proof    Effect of criminal drug conviction.                   Proof of participation in the illegal drug market in an action brought under this chapter          shall be shown by clear and convincing evidence.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,          other elements of the cause of action shall be shown by a preponderance of the evidence.                   A person against whom recovery is sought who has a criminal conviction pursuant to          state drug laws or the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of     , Public          Law       ,    Stat.     , codified at    U.S.C. Sec.     et seq., is estopped from denying          participation in the illegal drug market.  A conviction is also prima facie evidence of the person s          participation in the illegal drug market during the two years preceding the date of an act giving rise          to a conviction.                   The absence of a criminal drug conviction of a person against whom recovery is sought          does not bar an action against that person.              Section   .  Section       e    is enacted to read                     e   .  Prejudgment attachment and execution on judgments.                   A plaintiff under this chapter, subject to Subsection    , may request an ex parte          prejudgment writ of attachment from the court pursuant to Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule            A against all assets of a defendant sufficient to satisfy a potential award.  If attachment is          instituted, a defendant is entitled to an immediate hearing.  Attachment may be lifted if the                 defendant demonstrates that the assets will be available for a potential award or if the defendant         posts a bond sufficient to cover a potential award.                  A person against whom a judgment has been rendered under this chapter is not eligible         to exempt any property, of whatever kind, from process to levy or process to execute on the         judgment, unless the property is exempt by operation of law.                  Any assets sought to satisfy a judgment under this chapter that are named in a         forfeiture action or have been seized for forfeiture by any state or federal agency may not be used         to satisfy a judgment unless and until the assets have been released following the conclusion of         the forfeiture action or released by the agency that seized the assets.              Section   .  Section       e    is enacted to read                     e   .  Statute of limitations.                   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a claim under this chapter may not be          brought more than two years after the cause of action accrues.  A cause of action accrues under this          chapter when a person who may recover has reason to know of the harm from illegal drug use that          is the basis for the cause of action and has reason to know that the illegal drug use is the cause of          the harm.                   a   For a plaintiff, the statute of limitations under this section is tolled while the          individual potential plaintiff is incapacitated by the use of an illegal drug to the extent that the          individual cannot reasonably be expected to seek recovery under this chapter or as otherwise          provided by law.               b   For a defendant, the statute of limitations under this section is tolled until six months          after the individual potential defendant is convicted of a criminal drug offense or as otherwise          provided by law.                   A cause of action may not be asserted based on any act of the defendant which          occurred prior to the effective date of this chapter.              Section   .  Section       e    is enacted to read                     e   .  Representation of governmental entities    Stay of action.                   A county attorney, district attorney, or city attorney may represent any political          subdivision of the state, and the attorney general may represent the state in an action brought under          this chapter.                   On motion by a governmental agency involved in a drug investigation or prosecution,                 an action brought under this chapter shall be stayed until the completion of the criminal         investigation or prosecution that gave rise to the motion for a stay of the action.
