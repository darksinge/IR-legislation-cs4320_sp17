109

    
he be confined, upon a finding that the refusal was not privileged.
            
110

    
    (d)  A hearing may not be held under this part unless 72 hours notice is given to the
            
111

    
witness who has refused to comply with the order to testify or provide other information,
            
112

113

    
need so orders.
            
114

    
    (e)  Any confinement for refusal to comply with an order to testify or produce other
            
115

    
information shall continue until the witness is willing to give the testimony or provide the
            
116

    
information.  A period of confinement may not exceed the term of the grand jury, including
            
117

    
extensions, before which the refusal to comply with the order occurred.  In any event the

    (f)  A person confined under this Subsection (6) for refusal to testify or provide other

confined under this Subsection (6) or for criminal contempt for a subsequent refusal to testify

123

    
events.
            
124

    
    (g)  Any person confined under this section may be admitted to bail or released in
            
125

    
accordance with local procedures pending the determination of an appeal taken by him from
            
126

    
the order of his confinement unless the appeal affirmatively appears to be frivolous or taken for
            
127

    
delay.  Any appeal from an order of confinement under this section shall be disposed of as soon
            
128

130

    
    (7) (a)  All proceedings, except when the grand jury is deliberating or voting, shall be
            
131

    
recorded stenographically or by an electronic recording device.  An unintentional failure of any
            
132

    
recording to reproduce all or any portion of a proceeding does not affect the validity of any
            
133

    
prosecution or indictment.  The recording or reporter's notes or any transcript prepared from
            
134

    
them shall remain in the custody or control of the attorney for the state or the special prosecutor
            
135

    
unless otherwise ordered by the managing judge in a particular case.
            
136

    
    (b)  A grand juror, an interpreter, a court reporter, an operator of a recording device, a
            
137

    
typist who transcribes recorded testimony, an attorney for the state or special prosecutor, or any
            
138

    
person to whom disclosure is made under the provisions of this section may not disclose
            
139

    
matters occurring before the grand jury except as otherwise provided in this section.  A
            
140

    
knowing violation of this provision may be punished as a contempt of court.
            
141

    
    (c)  Disclosure otherwise prohibited by this section of matters occurring before the
            
142

    
grand jury, other than its deliberations and the vote of any grand juror, may be made to:
            
143

    
    (i)  an attorney for the state or a special prosecutor for use in the performance of that
            
144

    
attorney's duty; and
            
145

    
    (ii)  government personnel, including those of state, local, and federal entities and
            
146

    
agencies, as are considered necessary by the attorney for the state or special prosecutor to assist
            
147

    
him in the performance of his duty to enforce the state's criminal laws.
            
148

    
    (d)  Any person to whom matters are disclosed under this section may not utilize that
            
149

    
grand jury material for any purpose other than assisting the attorney for the state or the special
            
150

    
prosecutor in performance of that attorney's duty to enforce the state's criminal laws.  An
            
151

    
attorney for the state or the special prosecutor shall promptly provide the managing judge with

            
152


    
the names of the persons to whom the disclosure has been made and shall certify that the
            
153

    
attorney has advised the person of his obligation of secrecy under this section.
            
154

    
    (e)  Disclosure otherwise prohibited by this section of matters occurring before the
            
155

    
grand jury may also be made when:
            
156

    
    (i)  directed by the managing judge or by any court before which the indictment that
            
157

    
involves matters occurring before the grand jury that are subject to disclosure is to be tried,
            
158

    
preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding;
            
159

    
    (ii)  permitted by the managing judge at the request of the defendant, upon a showing
            
160

    
that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring
            
161

    
before the grand jury;
            
162

    
    (iii)  the disclosure is made by an attorney for the state or the special prosecutor to
            
163

    
another state or local grand jury or a federal grand jury;
            
164

    
    (iv)  permitted by the managing judge at the request of an attorney for the state or the
            
165

    
special prosecutor, upon a showing that the matters may disclose a violation of federal criminal
            
166

    
law, to an appropriate official of the federal government for the purpose of enforcing federal
            
167

    
law; or
            
168

    
    (v)  showing of special need is made and the managing judge is satisfied that disclosure
            
169

    
of the information or matters is essential for the preparation of a defense.
            
170

    
    (f)  When the matters are transcripts of testimony given by witnesses, the state or
            
171

    
special prosecutor intends to call in the state's case in chief in any trial upon an indictment
            
172

    
returned by the grand jury before which the witnesses testified, the attorney for the state or the
            
173

    
special prosecutor shall, no later than 30 days before trial, provide the defendant with access to
            
174

    
the transcripts.  The attorney for the state or the special prosecutor shall at the same time
            
175

    
provide the defendant with access to all exculpatory evidence presented to the grand jury prior
            
176

    
to indictment.
            
177

    
    (g)  When the managing judge orders disclosure of matters occurring before the grand
            
178

    
jury, disclosure shall be made in a manner, at a time, and under conditions the managing judge
            
179

    
directs.
            
180

    
    (h)  A petition for disclosure made under Subsection (7)(e)(ii) shall be filed with the
            
181

    
managing judge.  Unless the hearing is ex parte, the petitioner shall serve written notice upon
            
182

    
the attorney for the state or the special prosecutor, the parties to the judicial proceeding if

            
183


    
disclosure is sought in connection with the proceeding, and other persons as the managing
            
184

    
judge directs.  The managing judge shall afford those persons a reasonable opportunity to
            
185

    
appear and be heard.
            
186

    
    (8)  Records, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand jury proceedings shall be kept
            
187

    
under seal to the extent and so long as necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring
            
188

    
before the grand jury other than as provided in this section.
            
189

    
    (9)  Subject to any right to an open hearing in contempt proceedings, the managing
            
190

    
judge shall order a hearing on matters affecting a grand jury proceeding to be closed to the
            
191

    
extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before a grand jury.
