112

    
institutionalized spouse.
            
113

    
    (9)  When an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for medical
            
114

    
assistance, in determining the amount of the spouse's income that is to be applied monthly for

127

    (ii)  an excess shelter allowance.
            
132

    
    (b)  The amount provided in Subsection (10)(a) may not exceed $1,976, unless a court
            
133

    
order establishes a higher amount.
            
134

    
    (11) (a)  An institutionalized spouse or a community spouse may request a hearing with
            
135

    
respect to the determinations described in Subsections (11)(e)(i) through (v) if an application
            
136

    
for medical assistance has been made on behalf of the institutionalized spouse.
            
137

    
    (b)  A hearing under this subsection regarding the community spouse resource
            
138

    
allowance shall be held by the division within 90 days from the date of the request for the
            
139

    
hearing.
            
140

    
    (c)  If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs income, above the
            
141

    
level otherwise provided by the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, due to
            
142

    
exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, there shall be substituted,
            
143

    
for the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance provided under Subsection (10), an
            
144

    
amount adequate to provide additional income as is necessary.
            
145

    
    (d)  If either spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance, in
            
146

    
relation to the amount of income generated by the allowance is inadequate to raise the
            
147

    
community spouse's income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall
            
148

    
be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance, an amount adequate to provide a
            
149

    
minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.
            
150

    
    (e)  A hearing may be held under this subsection if either the institutionalized spouse or
            
151

    
community spouse is dissatisfied with a determination of:

            
152


    
    (i)  the community spouse monthly income allowance;
            
153

154

    
    (iii)  the computation of the spousal share of resources under Subsection (4);
            
155

    
    (iv)  the attribution of resources under Subsection (6); or
            
156

    
    (v)  the determination of the community spouse resource allocation.
            
157

    
    (12) (a)  An institutionalized spouse may transfer an amount equal to the community
            
158

    
spouse resource allowance, but only to the extent the resources of the institutionalized spouse
            
159

    
are transferred to or for the sole benefit of the community spouse.
            
160

    
    (b)  The transfer under Subsection (12)(a) shall be made as soon as practicable after the
            
161

    
date of the initial determination of eligibility, taking into account the time necessary to obtain a
            
162

    
court order under Subsection (12)(c).
            
163

    
    (c)  [Title 26,] Chapter 19, Medical Benefits Recovery Act, does not apply if a court has
            
164

    
entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse.

    Section 12.  
Section  
76-8-1206

 is amended to read:
            
621

    
     76-8-1206.  Penalties for public assistance fraud.
            
622

    
    (1)  The severity of the offense of public assistance fraud is classified in accordance
            
623

    
with the value of payments, assistance, or other benefits received, misappropriated, claimed, or
            
624

    
applied for as follows:
            
625

    
    (a)  second degree felony if the value is or exceeds $5,000;
            
626

    
    (b)  third degree felony if the value is or exceeds $1,500 but is less than $5,000;
            
627

    
    (c)  class A misdemeanor if the value is or exceeds $500 but is less than $1,500; and
            
628

    
    (d)  class B misdemeanor if the value is less than $500.
            
629

    
    (2)  For purposes of Subsection (1), the value of an offense is calculated by aggregating
            
630

    
the values of each instance of public assistance fraud committed by the defendant as part of the
            
631

    
same facts and circumstances or a related series of facts and circumstances.
            
632

    
    (3)  Incidents of trafficking in [food stamps] SNAP benefits as defined in Section
            
633

    


35A-1-102

 that occur within a six-month period, committed by an individual or coconspirators,
            
634

    
are deemed to be a related series of facts and circumstances regardless of whether the
            
635

    
transactions are conducted with a variety of unrelated parties.
            
636

    
    Section 13.  
Section  
78B-12-203

 is amended to read:
            
637

    
     78B-12-203.  Determination of gross income -- Imputed income.
            
638

    
    (1)  As used in the guidelines, "gross income" includes prospective income from any
            
639

    
source, including earned and nonearned income sources which may include salaries, wages,
            
640

    
commissions, royalties, bonuses, rents, gifts from anyone, prizes, dividends, severance pay,
            
641

    
pensions, interest, trust income, alimony from previous marriages, annuities, capital gains,
            
642

    
Social Security benefits, workers' compensation benefits, unemployment compensation,
            
643

    
income replacement disability insurance benefits, and payments from "nonmeans-tested"
            
644

    
government programs.
            
645

    
    (2)  Income from earned income sources is limited to the equivalent of one full-time
            
646

    
40-hour job. If and only if during the time prior to the original support order, the parent
            
647

    
normally and consistently worked more than 40 hours at the parent's job, the court may

            
648


    
consider this extra time as a pattern in calculating the parent's ability to provide child support.
            
649

    
    (3)  Notwithstanding Subsection (1), specifically excluded from gross income are:
            
650

    
    (a)  cash assistance provided under Title 35A, Chapter 3, Part 3, Family Employment
            
651

    
Program;
            
652

    
    (b)  benefits received under a housing subsidy program, the Job Training Partnership
            
653

    
Act,  Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, [Food
            
654

    
Stamps] SNAP benefits, or General Assistance; and
            
655

    
    (c)  other similar means-tested welfare benefits received by a parent.
            
656

    
    (4) (a)  Gross income from self-employment or operation of a business shall be
            
657

    
calculated by subtracting necessary expenses required for self-employment or business
            
658

    
operation from gross receipts.  The income and expenses from self-employment or operation of
            
659

    
a business shall be reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the
            
660

    
parent to satisfy a child support award.  Only those expenses necessary to allow the business to
            
661

    
operate at a reasonable level may be deducted from gross receipts.
            
662

    
    (b)  Gross income determined under this subsection may differ from the amount of
            
663

    
business income determined for tax purposes.
            
664

    
    (5) (a)  When possible, gross income should first be computed on an annual basis and
            
665

    
then recalculated to determine the average gross monthly income.
            
666

    
    (b)  Each parent shall provide verification of current income.  Each parent shall provide
            
667

    
year-to-date pay stubs or employer statements and complete copies of tax returns from at least
            
668

    
the most recent year unless the court finds the verification is not reasonably available. 
            
669

    
Verification of income from records maintained by the Department of Workforce Services may
            
670

    
be substituted for pay stubs, employer statements, and income tax returns.
            
671

    
    (c)  Historical and current earnings shall be used to determine whether an
            
672

    
underemployment or overemployment situation exists.
            
673

    
    (6)  Gross income includes income imputed to the parent under Subsection (7).
            
674

    
    (7) (a)  Income may not be imputed to a parent unless the parent stipulates to the
            
675

    
amount imputed, the parent defaults, or, in contested cases, a hearing is held and the judge in a
            
676

    
judicial proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding enters findings of
            
677

    
fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.
            
678

    
    (b)  If income is imputed to a parent, the income shall be based upon employment

            
679


    
potential and probable earnings as derived from employment opportunities, work history,
            
680

    
occupation qualifications, and prevailing earnings for persons of similar backgrounds in the
            
681

    
community, or the median earning for persons in the same occupation in the same geographical
            
682

    
area as found in the statistics maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
            
683

    
    (c)  If a parent has no recent work history or a parent's occupation is unknown, income
            
684

    
shall be imputed at least at the federal minimum wage for a 40-hour work week.  To impute a
            
685

    
greater income, the judge in a judicial proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative
            
686

    
proceeding shall enter specific findings of fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.
            
687

    
    (d)  Income may not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist and the
            
688

    
condition is not of a temporary nature:
            
689

    
    (i)  the reasonable costs of child care for the parents' minor children approach or equal
            
690

    
the amount of income the custodial parent can earn;
            
691

    
    (ii)  a parent is physically or mentally unable to earn minimum wage;
            
692

    
    (iii)  a parent is engaged in career or occupational training to establish basic job skills;
            
693

    
or
            
694

    
    (iv)  unusual emotional or physical needs of a child require the custodial parent's
            
695

    
presence in the home.
            
696

    
    (8) (a)  Gross income may not include the earnings of a minor child who is the subject
            
697

    
of a child support award nor benefits to a minor child in the child's own right such as
            
698

    
Supplemental Security Income.
            
699

    
    (b)  Social Security benefits received by a child due to the earnings of a parent shall be
            
700

    
credited as child support to the parent upon whose earning record it is based, by crediting the
            
701

    
amount against the potential obligation of that parent.  Other unearned income of a child may
            
702

    
be considered as income to a parent depending upon the circumstances of each case.
