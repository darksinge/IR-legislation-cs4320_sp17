 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-3-04  3:45 PM


This bill allocates certain state sales and use tax revenues to counties, cities, and towns to
prevent revenue losses to those counties, cities, and towns.  The revenue losses are as a result
of changes in the amount of local sales and use taxes a seller may retain if that seller is required
to remit sales and use taxes to the state on a monthly basis. The bill does not provide the
purposes for which the counties, cities, and towns may use the allocated revenues. Utah
Constitution Article XIII, Section 5, Utah's "vertical revenue sharing" provision,  provides that
"the Legislature may not impose a tax for the purpose of a political subdivision of the State, but
may by statute authorize political subdivisions of the State to assess and collect taxes for their
own purposes."  There is no Utah case holding that this constitutional provision prohibits the
Legislature from allocating state revenues to local governments. However, there is some
authority indicating that such an allocation may constitute impermissible vertical revenue
sharing if the revenues are used for a purely local purpose. A court could find that this
allocation to counties, cities, and towns constitutes impermissible vertical revenue sharing if
the court determines that because the bill does not provide the purposes for which the allocated
revenues may be expended, those revenues may be expended for purely local purposes.
However, a court could uphold the constitutionality of the allocation as having a state purpose
by finding that the state has an interest in simplifying state and local sales and use taxes and
this allocation prevents a resulting revenue loss to local governments.
