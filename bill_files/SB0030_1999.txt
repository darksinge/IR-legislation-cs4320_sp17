    (b)  A person convicted under this Subsection (4) is guilty of a first degree felony and shall
            

    
be imprisoned for a term of not less than five years if the penalty that would otherwise have been
            

    
established but for this subsection would have been a first degree felony.  Imposition or execution
            

    
of the sentence may not be suspended, and the person is not eligible for probation.
            

    
    (c)  If the classification that would otherwise have been established would have been less

is guilty of one degree more than the maximum penalty prescribed for that offense.
            

    
    (d)  It is not a defense to a prosecution under this Subsection (4) that the actor mistakenly
            

    
believed the individual to be 18 years of age or older at the time of the offense or was unaware of
            

    
the individual's true age; nor that the actor mistakenly believed that the location where the act
            

    
occurred was not as described in Subsection (4)(a) or was unaware that the location where the act
            

    
occurred was as described in Subsection (4)(a).
            

    
    (5)  Any violation of this chapter for which no penalty is specified is a class B misdemeanor.
            

    
    (6) (a)  Any penalty imposed for violation of this section is in addition to, and not in lieu of,
            

    
any civil or administrative penalty or sanction authorized by law.
            

    
    (b)  Where violation of this chapter violates a federal law or the law of another state,
            

    
conviction or acquittal under federal law or the law of another state for the same act is a bar to
            

    
prosecution in this state.
            

    
    (7)  In any prosecution for a violation of this chapter, evidence or proof which shows a person
            

    
or persons produced, manufactured, possessed, distributed, or dispensed a controlled substance or
            

    
substances, is prima facie evidence that the person or persons did so with knowledge of the character
            

    
of the substance or substances.
            

    
    (8)  This section does not prohibit a veterinarian, in good faith and in the course of his
            

    
professional practice only and not for humans, from prescribing, dispensing, or administering

            


    
controlled substances or from causing the substances to be administered by an assistant or orderly
            

    
under his direction and supervision.
            

    
    (9)  Civil or criminal liability may not be imposed under this section on:
            

    
    (a)  any person registered under the Controlled Substances Act who manufactures, distributes,
            

    
or possesses an imitation controlled substance for use as a placebo or investigational new drug by
            

    
a registered practitioner in the ordinary course of professional practice or research; or
            

    
    (b)  any law enforcement officer acting in the course and legitimate scope of his employment.
            

    
    (10)  If any provision of this chapter, or the application of any provision to any person or
            

    
circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter shall be given effect without the invalid
            

    
provision or application.
