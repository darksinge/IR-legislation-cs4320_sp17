47

    
an audit.
            
48

    
    (c)  If a governmental entity is prohibited from providing a record under Subsection

51

    
    (ii)  inform the person making the request that records requests must be submitted to the
            
52

    
governmental entity that prepares, owns, or retains the record.
            
53

    
    [(2)] (d)  A governmental entity may make rules in accordance with Title 63, Chapter
            
54

55

    (3) (a)  As soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ten business days after
            
57

    
receiving a written request, or five business days after receiving a written request if the

            
58


    
requester demonstrates that expedited response to the record request benefits the public rather
            
59

    
than the person, the governmental entity shall respond to the request by:

    (i)  approving the request and providing the record;
            
61

    
    (ii)  denying the request;

68

    
    (ii)  specify the date when the records will be available.
            
69

    
    (c)  Any person who requests a record to obtain information for a story or report for
            
70

    
publication or broadcast to the general public is presumed to be acting to benefit the public
            
71

    
rather than a person.
            
72

    
    (4)  The following circumstances constitute "extraordinary circumstances" that allow a
            
73

    
governmental entity to delay approval or denial by an additional period of time as specified in
            
74

    
Subsection (5) if the governmental entity determines that due to the extraordinary
            
75

    
circumstances it cannot respond within the time limits provided in Subsection (3):
            
76

    
    (a)  another governmental entity is using the record, in which case the originating
            
77

    
governmental entity shall promptly request that the governmental entity currently in possession
            
78

    
return the record;
            
79

    
    (b)  another governmental entity is using the record as part of an audit, and returning the
            
80

    
record before the completion of the audit would impair the conduct of the audit;

82

    (ii)  the requester seeks a substantial number of records or records series in requests
            
84

    
filed within five working days of each other;
            
85

    
    (d)  the governmental entity is currently processing a large number of records requests;

            
86


    
    (e)  the request requires the governmental entity to review a large number of records to
            
87

    
locate the records requested;
            
88

    
    (f)  the decision to release a record involves legal issues that require the governmental
            
89

    
entity to seek legal counsel for the analysis of statutes, rules, ordinances, regulations, or case
            
90

    
law;
            
91

    
    (g)  segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from information
            
92

    
that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires extensive editing; or
            
93

    
    (h)  segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from information
            
94

    
that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires computer programming.
            
95

    
    (5)  If one of the extraordinary circumstances listed in Subsection (4) precludes
            
96

    
approval or denial within the time specified in Subsection (3), the following time limits apply
            
97

    
to the extraordinary circumstances:
            
98

    
    (a)  for claims under Subsection (4)(a), the governmental entity currently in possession
            
99

    
of the record shall return the record to the originating entity within five business days of the
            
100

    
request for the return unless returning the record would impair the holder's work;
            
101

    
    (b)  for claims under Subsection (4)(b), the originating governmental entity shall notify
            
102

    
the requester when the record is available for inspection and copying;
            
103

    
    (c)  for claims under Subsections (4)(c), (d), and (e), the governmental entity shall:
            
104

    
    (i)  disclose the records that it has located which the requester is entitled to inspect;
            
105

    
    (ii)  provide the requester with an estimate of the amount of time it will take to finish
            
106

    
the work required to respond to the request;
            
107

    
    (iii)  complete the work and disclose  those records that the requester is entitled to
            
108

    
inspect as soon as reasonably possible; and
            
109

    
    (iv)  for any person that does not establish a right to an expedited response as
            
110

    
authorized by Subsection (3)(a), a governmental entity may choose to:
            
111

    
    (A)  require the person to provide for copying of the records as provided in Subsection
            
112

    

63-2-201

(9); or
            
113

    
    (B)  treat a request for multiple records as separate record requests, and respond

            
114


    
sequentially to each request;
            
115

    
    (d)  for claims under Subsection (4)(f), the governmental entity shall either approve or
            
116

    
deny the request within five business days after the response time specified for the original
            
117

    
request has expired;
            
118

    
    (e)  for claims under Subsection (4)(g), the governmental entity shall fulfill the request
            
119

    
within 15 business days from the date of the original request; or
            
120

    
    (f)  for claims under Subsection (4)(h), the governmental entity shall complete its
            
121

    
programming and disclose the requested records as soon as reasonably possible.
            
122

    
    (6) (a)  If a request for access is submitted to an office of a governmental entity other
            
123

    
than that specified by rule in accordance with Subsection (2), the office shall promptly forward
            
124

    
the request to the appropriate office.
            
125

    
    (b)  If the request is forwarded promptly, the time limit for response begins when the
            
126

    
record is received by the office specified by rule.
            
127

    
    (7)  If the governmental entity fails to provide the requested records or issue a denial
            
128

    
within the specified time period, that failure is considered the equivalent of a determination
            
129

    
denying access to the record.
