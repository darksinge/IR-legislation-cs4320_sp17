37

    
adult coordinator, may serve in various capacities within the courtroom, acting in the role of
            
38

    
jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks, and judges.
            
39

    
    (a)  Youth who appear before youth courts have been identified by law enforcement
            
40

    
personnel, school officials, a prosecuting attorney, or the juvenile court as having committed
            
41

    
acts which indicate a need for intervention to prevent further development toward juvenile
            
42

43

    
juvenile court process.
            
44

    
    (b)  Youth courts may only hear cases as provided for in this part.

juvenile court of the referral.
            
69

    
    [(5)] (6)  Youth courts may exercise authority over youth described in Subsection [(4)]

    [(6)] (7)  Permission of the juvenile court may be granted by a probation officer of the
            
74

    
court in the district that would have jurisdiction over the offense being referred to youth court.
            
75

    
    [(7)] (8)  Youth courts may decline to accept a youth for youth court disposition for any
