240

    
commercially reasonable and actuarially sound method for valuing and commuting the
            
241

    
obligations of the parties to the reinsurance agreement by providing in the contract the specific
            
242

    
methodology to be used for valuing and commuting the obligations.
            
243

    
    (4) (a)  A commutation provision is not effective if it is demonstrated to the court that
            
244

    
the provision was entered into in contemplation of the insolvency of one or more of the parties.

            
245


    
    (b)  A contractual commutation provision entered into within one year of the liquidation
            
246

    
order of the insurer shall be rebuttably presumed to have been entered into in contemplation of
            
247

    
insolvency.
