violence subsequent to the release of an offender who has been arrested for domestic violence,

it is the finding of the Legislature that domestic violence crimes, as defined in Section 

77-36-1

,
            
221

    
are crimes for which bail may be denied if there is substantial evidence to support the charge,
            
222

    
and if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged perpetrator would
            
223

    
constitute a substantial danger to an alleged victim of domestic violence if released on bail.
