Dispositional hearing -- Reunification services -- Exceptions.324          (1)  The court may:325          (a)  make any of the dispositions described in Section 78A-6-117;326          (b)  place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any:327          (i)  individual;

[or]334          (iv)  sibling visitation; or335          [(iv)] (v)  other services.336          (2)  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that337     the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first:338          (a)  establish a primary permanency plan for the minor; and339          (b)  determine whether, in view of the primary permanency plan, reunification services340     are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, pursuant to Subsections [(20)] (21)341     through [(22)] (23).342          (3)  Subject to Subsections (6) and (7), if the court determines that reunification343     services are appropriate for the minor and the minor's family, the court shall provide for344     reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,345     unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.346          (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe347     abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make348     "reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to349     attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.350          (5)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount351     concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.352          (6)  For purposes of Subsection (3), parent-time is in the best interests of a minor unless353     the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:354          (a)  protect the physical safety of the minor;355          (b)  protect the life of the minor; or356          (c)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the357     minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.358          (7)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), a court may not deny parent-time based solely on a359     parent's failure to:360          (a)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or361          (b)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.362          (8) (a)  In addition to the primary permanency plan, the court shall establish a363     concurrent permanency plan that shall include:364          (i)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency plan will365     be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency plan; and366          (ii)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency367     plan.368          (b)  In determining the primary permanency plan and concurrent permanency plan, the369     court shall consider:370          (i)  the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement;371          (ii)  the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent-child relationship is legally372     terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available; and373          (iii)  the use of an individualized permanency plan, only as a last resort.374          (9)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection375     78A-6-314(1)(b) within 30 days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if376     something other than reunification is initially established as a minor's primary permanency377     plan.378          (10) (a)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency plan before the379     establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 78A-6-314.380          (b)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency plan in the event381     that the primary permanency plan is abandoned.382          (c)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor's primary383     permanency plan, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section384     78A-6-314 on or before the earlier of:385          (i)  30 days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this386     Subsection (10)(c); or387          (ii)  the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section388     78A-6-314, ends.389          (11) (a)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order390     that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor's391     parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.392          (b)  In providing the services described in Subsection (11)(a), the minor's health, safety,393     and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.394          (12) (a)  The court shall:395          (i)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child396     and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;397          (ii)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family398     plan in accordance with Subsection 62A-4a-205(6)(e); and399          (iii)  identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties,400     the responsibilities described in Subsection (12)(a)(ii), for the purpose of assisting in any future401     determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and402     federal law.403          (b)  If the parent is in a substance abuse treatment program, other than a certified drug404     court program:405          (i)  the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in406     addition to the testing recommended by the parent's substance abuse program based on a407     finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol; and408          (ii)  the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing409     recommended by the substance abuse program to the court or division.410          (13) (a)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the411     date that the minor was initially removed from the minor's home, unless the time period is412     extended under Subsection 78A-6-314(7).413          (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12414     months of reunification services.415          (14) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at416     any time.417          (b)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined418     to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section419     78A-6-314, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:420          (i)  place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan; and421          (ii)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the422     minor.423          (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period424     described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.425          (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted426     by the court in accordance with Section 78A-6-314 at the expiration of the time period for427     reunification services.428          (b)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original429     removal of the minor.430          (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted431     within 30 days, in accordance with Section 78A-6-314.432          (17)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are433     ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six434     months from the date that reunification services were ordered:435          (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and436          (b)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.437          (18)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section438     78A-6-314, the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the439     sibling group together is:440          (a)  practicable; and441          (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.442          (19)  When siblings are separated, a court may order sibling visitation according to the443     court's determination of the best interests of the child for whom the hearing is held.444          [(19)] (20) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide445     permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a446     parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.447          (b)  The court may determine that:448          (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,449     based on the individual circumstances; and450          (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.451          (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in452     making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount453     concern.454          [(20)] (21)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to455     a parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following456     circumstances exist:457          (a)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit458     indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;459          (b)  subject to Subsection [(21)] (22)(a), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of460     such magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;461          (c)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,462     sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:463          (i)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;464          (ii)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and465          (iii)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual466     exploitation;467          (d)  the parent:468          (i)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect;469          (ii)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:470          (A)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or471          (B)  child abuse homicide;472          (iii)  committed sexual abuse against the child;473          (iv)  is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender; or474          (v) (A)  intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the475     child;476          (B)  is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation477     for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child; or478          (C)  is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or479     recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child;480          (e)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the481     parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the482     minor;483          (f)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,484     and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the485     offending parent;486          (g)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;487          (h)  the minor was removed from the minor's home on at least two previous occasions488     and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;489          (i)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;490          (j)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a491     location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation492     was located;493          (k)  except as provided in Subsection [(21)] (22)(b), with respect to a parent who is the494     child's birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or495     was exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child's mother while the496     child was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the497     mother agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a498     substance abuse treatment program approved by the department; or499          (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification500     efforts or services.501          [(21)] (22) (a)  The finding under Subsection [(20)] (21)(b) shall be based on competent502     evidence from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates,503     establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of504     adequately caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is505     made.506          (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection [(20)] (21)(k) if the court finds,507     under the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection508     [(20)] (21)(k) is not warranted.509          [(22)] (23)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court510     shall take into consideration:511          (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child512     and family plan;513          (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of514     drugs or alcohol;515          (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family516     member;517          (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;518          (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;519          (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be520     successful; and521          (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.522          [(23)] (24) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections [(19)]523     (20) through [(21)] (22), and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months524     after the day on which the out-of-home placement of the minor is made, the court may order525     the division to provide reunification services.526          (b)  The time limits described in Subsections (2) through (18) are not tolled by the527     parent's absence.528          [(24)] (25) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order529     reasonable services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.530          (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection [(24)] (25)(a), the court shall531     consider:532          (i)  the age of the minor;533          (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;534          (iii)  the length of the sentence;535          (iv)  the nature of the treatment;536          (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;537          (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;538          (vii)  for a minor 10 years old or older, the minor's attitude toward the implementation539     of family reunification services;
