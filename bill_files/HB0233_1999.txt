The preplacement adoptive evaluation shall include                                   a   criminal history record information regarding each prospective adoptive parent and any                             other adult living in the prospective home, received from the Criminal Investigations and                             Technical Services Division of the Department of Public Safety, in accordance with Section                                           , no earlier than    months immediately preceding placement of the child                                   b   a report from the Department of Human Services containing all information regarding                             reports and investigation of child abuse, neglect, and dependency, with respect to each prospective                             adoptive parent and any other adult living in the prospective home, obtained no earlier than                                months immediately preceding placement of the child, pursuant to waivers executed by those                             parties  and                                  c  an evaluation conducted by an expert in family relations approved by the court or a                             certified social worker, clinical social worker, marriage and family therapist, psychologist,                             professional counselor, or other court determined expert in family relations, who is licensed to                             practice under the laws of this state.  The evaluation shall be in a form approved by the Department                             of Human Services.  Neither the Department of Human Services nor any of its divisions may                             proscribe who qualifies as an expert in family relations or who may conduct evaluations pursuant                             to this Subsection    .                                       a    A copy of the preplacement adoptive evaluation shall be filed with the court.                                      a  Except as provided in Subsections  b  and  c , a postplacement evaluation shall be                             conducted and submitted to the court prior to the final hearing in an adoption proceeding. The                             postplacement evaluation shall include                                     i   verification of the allegations of fact contained in the petition for adoption                                   ii   an evaluation of the progress of the child s placement in the adoptive home  and                                  iii   a recommendation regarding whether the adoption is in the best interest of the child.                                  b   The exemptions from and requirements for evaluations, described in Subsections                                 c ,     c , and    , also apply to postplacement adoptive evaluations.                                  c   Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may waive the postplacement adoptive                             evaluation, unless it determines that it is in the best interest of the child to require the                             postplacement evaluation.                                      If the person or agency conducting the evaluation disapproves the adoptive placement,                             either in the preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation, the court may dismiss the                             petition. However, upon request of a prospective adoptive parent, the court shall order that an                             additional preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation be conducted, and hold a hearing                             on the suitability of the adoption, including testimony of interested parties.                                      Prior to finalization of a petition for adoption the court shall review and consider the                             information and recommendations contained in the preplacement and postplacement adoptive                             studies required by this section.
