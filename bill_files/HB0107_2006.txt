77

    
     53A-17a-106.  Determination of weighted pupil units.
            
78

    
    The number of weighted pupil units in the minimum school program for each year is
            
79

    
the total of the units for each school district determined as follows:
            
80

    
    (1)  The number of units is computed by adding the average daily membership of all
            
81

    
pupils of the district attending schools, other than:
            
82

    
    (a)  kindergarten pupils who do not attend a full-day kindergarten under Section

pupils of the district enrolled in kindergarten who are not enrolled in full-day kindergarten
            
87

    
under Section

90


    
    [(b)] (ii)  Upon board approval, the number of pupils in average daily membership at
            
91

    
the short-term kindergarten shall be counted for the purpose of determining the number of units
            
92

    
allowed in the same ratio as the number of days the short-term kindergarten is held, not
            
93

    
exceeding nine weeks, compared to the total number of days schools are held in that district in
            
94

the distribution is based on kindergarten through grade 12 ADMs or weighted pupil units.
            
98

    
    (b)  Under prior year plus growth, kindergarten through grade 12 average daily
            
99

    
membership for the current year is based on the actual kindergarten through grade 12 average
            
100

    
daily membership for the previous year plus an estimated percentage growth factor.
            
101

    
    (c)  The growth factor is the percentage increase in total average daily membership on
            
102

    
the first school day of October in the current year as compared to the total average daily
            
103

    
membership on the first school day of October of the previous year.
            
104

    
    Section 3.   Appropriation.
            
105

    
    As an ongoing appropriation subject to future budget constraints, there is appropriated
