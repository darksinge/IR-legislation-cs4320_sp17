     53A-17a-133.  State-supported voted leeway program authorized -- Election
            
35

36

    
    (1)  An election to consider adoption or modification of a voted leeway program is
            
37

    
required if initiative petitions signed by 10% of the number of electors who voted at the last
            
38

    
preceding general election are presented to the local school board or by action of the board.
            
39

    
    (2) (a) (i)  To establish a voted leeway program, a majority of the electors of a district
            
40

    
voting at an election in the manner set forth in Section 

53A-16-110

 must vote in favor of a
            
41

    
special tax.
            
42

    
    (ii)  The tax rate may not exceed .002 per dollar of taxable value.
            
43

    
    (b)  The district may maintain a school program which exceeds the cost of the program
            
44

    
referred to in Section 

53A-17a-145

 with this voted leeway.
            
45

    
    (c)  In order to receive state support the first year, a district must receive voter approval
            
46

    
no later than December 1 of the year prior to implementation.
            
47

    
    (3) (a)  Under the voted leeway program, the state shall contribute an amount sufficient
            
48

    
to guarantee $17.54 per weighted pupil unit for each .0001 of the first .0016 per dollar of
            
49

    
taxable value.
            
50

    
    (b)  The same dollar amount guarantee per weighted pupil unit for the .0016 per dollar
            
51

    
of taxable value under Subsection (3)(a) shall apply to the board-approved leeway authorized
            
52

    
in Section 

53A-17a-134

, so that the guarantee shall apply up to a total of .002 per dollar of
            
53

    
taxable value if a school district levies a tax rate under both programs.
            
54

    
    (c) (i)  Beginning July 1, 2005, the $17.54 guarantee under Subsections (3)(a) and (b)
            
55

    
shall be indexed each year to the value of the weighted pupil unit by making the value of the
            
56

    
guarantee equal to .008544 times the value of the prior year's weighted pupil unit.
            
57

    
    (ii)  The guarantee shall increase by .0005 times the value of the prior year's weighted

            
58


    
pupil unit for each succeeding year until the guarantee is equal to .010544 times the value of
            
59

    
the prior year's weighted pupil unit.
            
60

    
    (d) (i)  The amount of state guarantee money to which a school district would otherwise
            
61

    
be entitled to under this Subsection (3) may not be reduced for the sole reason that the district's
            
62

    
levy is reduced as a consequence of changes in the certified tax rate under Section 

59-2-924


            
63

    
pursuant to changes in property valuation.
            
64

65

    
the certified tax rate.
            
66

67

    
of the existing program unless the proposition submitted to the electors expressly so states.
            
68

    
    (b)  A majority vote opposing a modification does not deprive the district of authority to
            
69

    
continue an existing program.
            
70

    
    (c)  If adoption of a leeway program is contingent upon an offset reducing other local
            
71

    
school board levies, the board must allow the electors, in an election, to consider modifying or
            
72

    
discontinuing the program prior to a subsequent increase in other levies that would increase the
            
73

    
total local school board levy.
            
74

    
    (d)  Nothing contained in this section terminates, without an election, the authority of a
            
75

    
school district to continue an existing voted leeway program previously authorized by the
            
76

    
voters.

102

103

    
    (b)  if a local school board determines that the average class size in the school district is
