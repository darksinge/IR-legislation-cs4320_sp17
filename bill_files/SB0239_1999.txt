STATE OF UTAH

            

    
 Sponsor:  Howard C. Nielson

            

    
AN ACT RELATING TO SCHOOL AND INSTITUTIONAL TRUST LANDS; MODIFYING
            

    
THE INFORMATION REQUIRED ON A NOTICE TO BE FILED WITH THE
            

    
ADMINISTRATION REGARDING PREEXISTING FEDERAL MINING CLAIMS ON TRUST
            

    
LANDS.
            

    
This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated 1953 as follows:
            

    
AMENDS:
            

    
     53C-2-104, as enacted by Chapter 72, Laws of Utah 1997
            

    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
53C-2-104

 is amended to read:
            

    
     53C-2-104.   Preexisting federal mining claims on trust lands -- Filing of notice --
            

    
 Conclusive evidence of abandonment.
            

    
    (1)  The Legislature recognizes the importance of having an effective state filing system
            

    
for unpatented federal mining claims located on trust lands prior to the state's acquisition of title
            

    
that would allow the state to determine the extent of preexisting unpatented mining claims on those
            

    
lands and eliminate the cloud on the state's title created by abandoned unpatented mining claims,
            

    
while preserving the rights of owners of valid preexisting unpatented mining claims located on
            

    
those lands.
            

    
    (2)  Prior to January 1, 1998, and annually thereafter on or before December 31, each owner
            

    
of an unpatented lode mining claim, placer mining claim, mill site claim, or tunnel site claim
            

    
located pursuant to the general mining laws of the United States on lands now owned of record by
            

    
the state in trust for the common schools or other beneficiary institutions shall file with the
            

    
administration a notice as prescribed by Subsection (3).
            

    
    (3) (a)  The notice required by Subsection (2) that is filed prior to January 1, 1998, shall
            

    
include:

            

    
    [(a)] (i)  a statement of the owner's intention to hold or abandon the claim;
            

    
    [(b)] (ii)  a brief description of the type and nature of the claim;
            

    
    [(c)] (iii)  the date the claim was located, and the date the claim was filed of record in county
            

    
and federal records;
            

    
    [(d)] (iv)  a copy of the official record of the notice of location or certificate of location of
            

    
the claim; and
            

    
    [(e)] (v)  a legal description of the claim, by legal subdivision or metes and bounds
            

    
description, sufficient to locate the claimed lands on the ground.
            

    
    (b)  A notice required by Subsection (2) that is filed after January 1, 1998, shall include:
            

    
    (i)  the name of the claim; and
            

    
    (ii)  a statement of the owners intentions to hold or abandon the claim.
            

    
    (4) (a)  The administration shall note the existence of all claims for which notices have been
            

    
filed in the central index of all trust lands required under Section 

53C-2-101

.
            

    
    (b)  The administration may impose a reasonable filing fee as a condition for accepting the
            

    
required notices, not to exceed $50 per claim, to defray the administrative costs of maintaining an
            

    
index of claims.
            

    
    (5) (a)  Failure to file the notice required by this section constitutes an abandonment of the
            

    
claim by the owner.
            

    
    (b)  Filing of the required notice by one owner of a claim in which multiple persons own or
            

    
claim interests fulfills the filing requirements of this section.
            

    
    (6)  Filing of a notice under this section does not make valid a claim which is otherwise
            

    
invalid under other applicable law.
            

    
    (7)  Acquisition of rights to extract minerals underlying trust lands is governed by Part 4 of
            

    
this chapter.
            

    
    (8)  This section does not waive any fees, filings, or other requirements imposed by federal
            

    
law.
