Subject to Subsection      a       , the county may determine the        comprehensiveness, extent, and format of the general plan.                  If a county has designated a mountainous planning district, the general plan for the        mountainous planning district is the controlling plan and takes precedence over a municipality s        general plan for property located within the mountainous planning district.                  Nothing in this part may be construed to limit the authority of the state to manage        and protect wildlife under Title   , Wildlife Resources Code of Utah.             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    . Plan preparation.                  a   The planning commission shall provide notice, as provided in Section             a    , of its intent to make a recommendation to the county legislative body for a general        plan or a comprehensive general plan amendment when the planning commission initiates the        process of preparing its recommendation.              b   The planning commission shall make and recommend to the legislative body a        proposed general plan for               i   the unincorporated area within the county  or              ii   if the planning commission is a planning commission for a mountainous planning        district, the mountainous planning district.              c   i   The plan may include planning for incorporated areas if, in the planning        commission s judgment, they are related to the planning of the unincorporated territory or of        the county as a whole.              ii   Elements of the county plan that address incorporated areas are not an official plan        or part of a municipal plan for any municipality, unless it is recommended by the municipal        planning commission and adopted by the governing body of the municipality.              iii   Notwithstanding Subsection     c  ii , if property is located in a mountainous        planning district, the plan for the mountainous planning district controls and precedes a        municipal plan, if any, to which the property would be subject.                  a   At a minimum, the proposed general plan, with the accompanying maps, charts,        and descriptive and explanatory matter, shall include the planning commission s        recommendations for the following plan elements               i   a land use element that               A

and grounds, open space, and other categories of public and private uses of land as        appropriate  and              B   may include a statement of the projections for and standards of population density        and building intensity recommended for the various land use categories covered by the plan               ii   a transportation and traffic circulation element consisting of the general location        and extent of existing and proposed freeways, arterial and collector streets, mass transit, and        any other modes of transportation that the planning commission considers appropriate, all        correlated with the population projections and the proposed land use element of the general        plan               iii   an estimate of the need for the development of additional moderate income        housing within the unincorporated area of the county or the mountainous planning district, and        a plan to provide a realistic opportunity to meet estimated needs for additional moderate        income housing if long term projections for land use and development occur  and              iv   before  July  ,       May  ,     , a resource management plan detailing the        findings, objectives, and policies required by Subsection      a       .              b   In drafting the moderate income housing element, the planning commission               i   shall consider the Legislature s determination that counties should facilitate a        reasonable opportunity for a variety of housing, including moderate income housing               A   to meet the needs of people desiring to live there  and              B   to allow persons with moderate incomes to benefit from and fully participate in all        aspects of neighborhood and community life  and              ii   may include an analysis of why the recommended means, techniques, or        combination of means and techniques provide a realistic opportunity for the development of        moderate income housing within the planning horizon, which means or techniques may include        a recommendation to               A   rezone for densities necessary to assure the production of moderate income        housing               B   facilitate the rehabilitation or expansion of infrastructure that will encourage the        construction of moderate income housing               C   encourage the rehabilitation of existing uninhabitable housing stock into moderate        income housing               D   consider county general fund subsidies to waive construction related fees that are        otherwise generally imposed by the county               E   consider utilization of state or federal funds or tax incentives to promote the        construction of moderate income housing               F   consider utilization of programs offered by the Utah Housing Corporation within        that agency s funding capacity  and              G   consider utilization of affordable housing programs administered by the        Department of Workforce Services.              c   In drafting the land use element, the planning commission shall               i   identify and consider each agriculture protection area within the unincorporated area        of the county or mountainous planning district  and              ii   avoid proposing a use of land within an agriculture protection area that is        inconsistent with or detrimental to the use of the land for agriculture.               d   In drafting the resource management plan required under Section      a    , the        planning commission shall                 i   identify any common interests the county shares with any other proximate county        with regards to the elements of the resource management plan as described in Subsection             a        b   and                ii   coordinate with the other proximate county to establish, to the greatest extent        possible, consistent objectives and policies with regards to the common interests identified        under Subsection     d  i .                   The proposed general plan may include               a   an environmental element that addresses               i   to the extent not covered by the county s resource management plan, the protection,        conservation, development, and use of natural resources, including the quality of air, forests,        soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources         and              ii   the reclamation of land, flood control, prevention and control of the pollution of        streams and other waters, regulation of the use of land on hillsides, stream channels and other        environmentally sensitive areas, the prevention, control, and correction of the erosion of soils,        protection of watersheds and wetlands, and the mapping of known geologic hazards               b   a public services and facilities element showing general plans for sewage, water,        waste disposal, drainage, public utilities, rights of way, easements, and facilities for them,        police and fire protection, and other public services               c   a rehabilitation, redevelopment, and conservation element consisting of plans and        programs for               i   historic preservation               ii   the diminution or elimination of blight  and              iii   redevelopment of land, including housing sites, business and industrial sites, and        public building sites               d   an economic element composed of appropriate studies and forecasts, as well as an        economic development plan, which may include review of existing and projected county        revenue and expenditures, revenue sources, identification of basic and secondary industry,        primary and secondary market areas, employment, and retail sales activity               e   recommendations for implementing all or any portion of the general plan, including        the use of land use ordinances, capital improvement plans, community development and        promotion, and any other appropriate action               f   provisions addressing any of the matters listed in Subsection      a         and              g   any other element the county considers appropriate.
