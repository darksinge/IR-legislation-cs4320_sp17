For the purposes of this                             agreement, the term  states  is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto                             Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.                                  b   The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states                             entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the                             governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard,                             man made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders,                             insurgency, or enemy attack.                                  c   This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency related                             exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating                             performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of                             party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency                             periods.  Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states  national guard                             forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual                             agreement between states.                                      Article II.  General Implementation.                                      a   Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies                             transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is                             essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact.  Each state further                             recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present                             procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an                             emergency.  This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need                                in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies                             exist.                                  b   The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states,                             including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source,                             that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or                             disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this                             compact shall be understood.                                  c   On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally                             designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be                             responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures                             necessary to implement this compact.                                      Article III.  Party State Responsibilities.                                      a   It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans                             and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this                             article.  In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as                             practical, shall                                   i   review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible,                             determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to                             natural disaster, technological hazard, man made disaster, emergency aspects of resource                             shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack                                   ii   review party states  individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will                             determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning                             any potential emergency                                   iii   develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any                             identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans                                   iv   assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries                                   v   protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food,                             energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both                             human and material                                   vi   inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and                             material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness  and                                     vii   provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes.                                  b   The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another                             party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state.  The provisions of this                             agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives.                              Requests may be verbal or in writing.  If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing                             within    days of the verbal request.  Requests shall provide the following information                                   i   a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such                             as, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation,                             communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information                             assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue                                   ii   the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a                             reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed  and                                  iii   the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party s response and a point                             of contact at that location.                                  c   There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned                             emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party                             states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of                             information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.                                      Article IV.  Limitations.                                      a   Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training                             for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the                             resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof  provided that it is                             understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to                             provide reasonable protection for such state.                                  b   Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while                             operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same                             powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights,                             and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency                             services.  Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular                             leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency                             services authorities of the state receiving assistance.  These conditions may be activated, as                                needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of                             the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual                             aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the                             state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving                             state, whichever is longer.                                      Article V.  Licenses and Permits.                                 Whenever any person holds a license, certificate, or other permit issued by any state                             party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or                             other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person                             shall be deemed licensed, certified, or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid                             involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and                             conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or                             otherwise.                                      Article VI.  Liability.                                 Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this                             compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity                             purposes  and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant                             to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of                             such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or                             supplies in connection therewith.  Good faith in this article shall not include willful                             misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.                                      Article VII.  Supplementary Agreements.                                 Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid                             among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this                             instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein                             contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another                             state or affect any other agreements already in force between states.  Supplementary agreements                             may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured                             and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance,                             welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.                                      Article VIII.  Compensation.                                    Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to                             injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members                             of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant                             to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were                             sustained within their own state.                                      Article IX.  Reimbursement.                                 Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be                             reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred                             in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for                             aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests  provided, that any aiding party                             state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan                             such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost  and                             provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements                             establishing a different allocation of costs among those states.  Article VIII expenses shall not                             be reimbursable under this provision.                                       Article X.  Evacuation.                                       a   Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the                             civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so                             warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency                             management or services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident                             requiring evacuations might occur.                                  b   Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees                             come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be                             received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will                             be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of                             relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of                             additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors.                                  c   Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state                             from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out of pocket                             expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for                             transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items.  Such expenditures                                shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come.  After the                             termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall                             assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.                                       Article XI.  Implementation.                                       a   This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law                             by any two states  thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its                             enactment by such state.                                  b   Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the                             same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until    days after the governor of the                             withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other                             party states.  Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed                             hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.                                  c   Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as                             may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party                             states and with the federal emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of                             the United States government.
