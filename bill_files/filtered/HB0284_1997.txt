That                b   The assignment                i   authorizes the department to submit its claim to the third party and authorizes payment          of benefits directly to the department .

The assignment of benefits includes medical support and third party payments ordered,          decreed, or adjudged by any court of this state or any other state or territory of the United States.          That assignment is not in lieu of, and does not supersede or alter any other court order, decree, or          judgment.                   When an assignment takes effect, the recipient is entitled to receive medical assistance,          and the benefits paid to the department are a reimbursement to the department.              Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Recovery of medical assistance from third party liable for payment    Lien              Notice    Action    Compromise or waiver    Recipient s right to action protected.                   a   When the department provides or becomes obligated to provide medical assistance          to a recipient because of an injury, disease, or disability for which a third party is liable, the          department may recover the medical assistance directly from that third party.               b   The department s claim to recover medical assistance provided as a result of  the injury,          disease, or disability is a lien against any proceeds payable to or on behalf of the recipient by that                 third party.  This lien has priority over all other claims to the proceeds, except claims for attorney s         fees and costs authorized under Subsection           .                  The department shall mail or deliver written notice of its lien to the third party at its         principal place of business or last known address.  The notice shall include the recipient s name,         the approximate date of injury, a general description of the type of injury and, if applicable, the         general location where the injury is alleged to have occurred.                  The department may commence an action on its lien in its own name, but that lien is         not enforceable as to a third party unless               a   the third party receives written notice of the department s lien before it settles with the          recipient  or               b   the department has evidence that the third party had knowledge that the department          provided or was obligated to provide medical assistance.                   The department may waive a claim against a third party in whole or in part, or may          compromise, settle, or release a claim or lien.                   An action commenced under this section does not bar an action by a recipient or a          dependent of a recipient for loss or damage not included in the department s action.                   A lien established by the department under this section follows and attaches to any          proceeds that may enter into a trust in violation of this section.              Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Statute of limitations    Survival of right of action    Insurance policy not           to limit time allowed for recovery.                   a   An action commenced by the department under this chapter against a health          insurance carrier or employee welfare benefit plan must be commenced within two years after the          date of the injury or onset of the illness or within six months after the date of the last payment for          medical assistance  payment , whichever is later.               b   An action against any other third party must be commenced within four years after the          date of the injury or onset of the illness, or within six months after the date of the last payment for          medical assistance  payment , whichever is later.                   The death of the recipient does not abate any right of action established by this chapter.                   No insurance policy issued or renewed after June  ,     , may contain any provision          that limits the time in which the department may submit its claim to recover medical assistance                 benefits to a period of less than    months from the date the provider furnishes services or goods         to the recipient.

Any trust provision that denies recovery for medical assistance is void on and after the          time of its making.                   Except as provided in Section        , a lien or encumbrance may not be imposed          against the property of a recipient before his death because of medical assistance correctly          provided or to be provided on behalf of the recipient before he is    years of age.

The department may                           recover medical assistance incorrectly provided, whether due to administrative or         factual error or fraud, from the recipient or his estate  and                  pursuant to a judgment, impose a lien against real property of the recipient.

Any third party required to make payment to the department pursuant to this chapter         shall make the payment directly to the department.                  The payment or payment instrument may not require the recipient or any other party         to co sign or otherwise require participation from the recipient or any other party in order for the          department to negotiate the instrument.              Section  .  Section    A       is amended to read                  A      .  Discretionary trusts for persons with disabilities    Impact on state           services.
