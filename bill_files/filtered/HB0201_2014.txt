Virtual parent time is designed to supplement, not replace, in person                           parent time.

Section  .    Section           .      is enacted to read                                       . .  Supervised parent time.                                    When strictly necessary to protect a child and no less restrictive means is                          reasonably available, a court may order supervised parent time if the court determines from                          sufficient available evidence that the child would be subject to physical, psychological, or                          emotional danger from the noncustodial parent if left unsupervised with the noncustodial                          parent.                                    A court that indicates its intention to order supervised parent time shall require                          both parties to provide the names of at least two persons who are capable and willing to                          supervise the proposed noncustodial parent if needed during parent time.                                    The court shall select one name from each list and designate one to be the primary                          supervisor and one to be the secondary supervisor.  The secondary supervisor may only be used                          when the primary supervisor is unavailable.  The court shall provide additional guidance and                          direction for parent time when neither supervisor is available.                                    The court shall diligently strive to give preference to a relative of the noncustodial                          parent who is known to the child, or an individual recommended by the noncustodial parent,                          when making the selection in Subsection    .                                    a   Supervised parent time may only be assigned to a paid service if the court finds                          that there is no suitable relative or recommended individual willing and able to fulfill the role                          as provided in Subsection    .                                   b   A paid service provider may not cause undue financial hardship that effectively                          prevents a parent from full and fair exercise of the parent s rights pursuant to Sections                              A  a          and      A           .                                c   A noncustodial parent may petition the court and is entitled to restoration of                          unsupervised parent time due to improved circumstances and correction of former conditions                          that the previous order was based upon.  Supervised parent time is an extreme protective                          measure.  Relief shall be made available on an expedited basis to the fullest extent possible.                           Supervised parent time is temporary and may not cause or contribute to potential irretrievable                          destruction of family relationships.  A reasonable plan for eliminating the need for supervision                          may be ordered by the court.  At all times, the court shall balance parental rights, children s                           interests, and family unity.                                 d   A noncustodial parent s inability to pay for expenses associated with this                           Subsection     is not cause to withhold parent time and is solely subject to debt collection                           procedures and remedies.
