Legislative Review Note      as of                  PM   As required by legislative rules and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General  Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its  own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The note is based on an analysis of  relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill. The note is not written for the  purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide  information relevant to legislators  consideration of this bill. The note is not a substitute for the  judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a law in the  context of a specific case.    This bill enacts the Transfer of Public Lands Act, which requires the United States to    extinguish title to public lands and transfer title to public lands to the state on or before  December   ,     .   If challenged, this bill raises questions of who has the right to dispose of and possess the land  held by the United States.   The  Property Clause  of the Constitution of the United States authorizes Congress  to dispose  of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property  belonging to the United States . . .  U.S. Const. art. IV, sec.  , cl.  . The Supreme Court of the  United States has held that  Congress has the same power over  territory  as over any other  property belonging to the United States  and this power is vested in Congress without  limitation . . .  United States v. Gratiot,    U.S.    ,           . See also Kleppe v. New  Mexico,     U.S.    ,           . Pursuant to its broad authority under the Property Clause,  Congress may enact legislation to manage or sell federal land, and any legislation Congress  enacts  necessarily overrides conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause.  Kleppe,      U.S. at    . See U.S. Const. art. VI, cl.  .  The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that   w ith respect to the public domain, the  Constitution vests in Congress the power of disposition and of making all needful rules and  regulations.  That power is subject to no limitations.  Congress has the absolute right to  prescribe the times, the conditions, and the mode of transferring this property, or any part of it,  and to designate the persons to whom the transfer shall be made.  No State legislation can  interfere with this right or embarrass its exercise  and to prevent the possibility of any  attempted interference with it, a provision has been usually inserted in the compacts by which  new States have been admitted to the Union, that such interference with the primary disposal of  the soil of the United States shall never be made.  Gibson v. Chouteau,    U.S.          .  The Transfer of Public Lands Act requires that the United States extinguish title to public lands  and transfer title to those public lands to Utah by a date certain.  Under the Gibson case, that  requirement would interfere with Congress  power to dispose of public lands.  Thus, that  requirement, and any attempt by Utah in the future to enforce the requirement, have a high  probability of being declared unconstitutional.
