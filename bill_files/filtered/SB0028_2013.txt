When appropriate, a standard shall prescribe suitable protective equipment and                            control or technological procedures for use in connection with such hazards and provide for                            monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in a manner                            necessary for the protection of employees.  In addition, any such standard shall prescribe the                            type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available by the                            employer, or at the employer s cost, to employees exposed to hazards in order to most                            effectively determine whether the health of employees is adversely affected by exposure.  If                            medical examinations are in the nature of research as determined by the division, the                            examinations may be furnished at division expense.  The results of such examinations or tests                            shall be furnished only to the division  and, at the request of the employee, to the employee s                            physician.                                 ii   The administrator may by rule make appropriate modifications in requirements for                            the use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical                            examinations warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments                            acquired subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.                                  f    e   Whenever a rule issued by the administrator differs substantially from an                            existing national consensus standard, the division shall publish a statement of the reasons why                            the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national                               consensus standard.                                  g    f   Whenever a rule, standard, or national consensus standard is modified by the                            secretary so as to make less restrictive the federal Williams Steiger Occupational Safety and                            Health Act of     , the less restrictive modification shall be immediately applicable to this                            chapter and shall be immediately implemented by the division.                                     a   The administrator shall provide an emergency temporary standard to take                            immediate effect upon publication if the administrator determines that                                  i   employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents                            determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards  and                                 ii   that the standard is necessary to protect employees from danger.                                 b   An emergency standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard issued in                            accordance with the procedures prescribed in Subsection     c .                                 c   Upon publication of an emergency standard the division shall commence a                            proceeding in accordance with Subsection     and the standard as published shall serve as a                            proposed rule for the proceedings.  The division shall issue a standard under Subsection     no                            later than     days after publication of the emergency standard.                                     a   Any affected employer may apply to the division for a rule or order for a                            variance from a standard issued under this section.  Affected employees shall be given notice of                            each application and may participate in a hearing.  The administrator shall issue a rule or order                            if the administrator determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where                            appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a                            preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or                            processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and a                            workplace to the employer s employees that are as safe and healthful as those which would                            prevail if the employer complied with the standard.                                 b   The rule or order issued under Subsection     a  shall prescribe the conditions the                            employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations and processes that the                            employer must adopt and use to the extent they differ from the standard in question.                                    c   A rule or order issued under Subsection     a  may be modified or revoked upon                            application by an employer, employees, or by the administrator on its own motion, in the                            manner prescribed for its issuance under Subsection     at any time after six months from its                            issuance.                                     The administrator shall include a statement of reasons for the administrator s                            actions when the administrator                                  a   issues any code, standard, rule, or order                                  b   grants any exemption or extension of time  or                                 c   compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this chapter.                                     Any person adversely affected by a standard issued under this section, at any time                            prior to    days after a standard is issued, may file a petition challenging its validity with the                            district court having jurisdiction for judicial review.  A copy of the petition shall be served                            upon the division by the petitioner.  The filing of a petition may not, unless otherwise ordered                            by the court, operate as a stay of the standard.  The determinations of the division shall be                            conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.                                     In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the division                            shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for                            particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments.

run Medicare program                                  H   whether the state has the infrastructure necessary to implement and administer a                            better state based Medicare program                                  I   whether the compact appropriately delegates policy decisions between the                            legislative and executive branches of government regarding the development and                            implementation of the compact with other states and the federal government  and                                 J   the impact on public health
