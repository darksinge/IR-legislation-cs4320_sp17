Sec.                                      iv   BLM inventories for the presence of wilderness characteristics must be closely                           coordinated with inventories for those characteristics conducted by state and local                           governments, and should reflect a consensus among those governmental agencies about the                           existence of wilderness characteristics, as follows                                 A   any inventory of wilderness characteristics should reflect all of the criteria                           identified in the Wilderness Act of     , including                                 I   a size of  ,    acres or more, containing no visible roads  and                                II   the presence of naturalness, the opportunity for primitive and unconfined                           recreation, and the opportunity for solitude                                    B   geographic areas found to contain the presence of naturalness must appear pristine                           to the average viewer, and not contain any of the implements, artifacts, or effects of human                           presence, including                                 I   visible roads, whether maintained or not  and                                II   human made features such as vehicle bridges, fire breaks, fisheries, enhancement                           facilities, fire rings, historic mining and other properties, including tailings piles, commercial                           radio and communication repeater sites, fencing, spring developments, linear disturbances,                           stock ponds, visible drill pads, pipeline and transmission line rights of way, and other similar                           features                                 C   factors, such as the following, though not necessarily conclusive, should weigh                            against a determination that a land area has the presence of naturalness                                  I   the area is or once was the subject of mining and drilling activities                                  II   mineral and hard rock mining leases exist in the area  and                                 III   the area is in a grazing district with active grazing allotments and visible range                            improvements                                  D   geographic areas found to contain the presence of solitude should convey the sense                            of solitude within the entire geographic area identified, otherwise boundary adjustments should                            be performed in accordance with Subsection     c  iv  F                                   E   geographic areas found to contain the presence of an opportunity for primitive and                            unconfined recreation must find these features within the entire area and provide analysis about                            the effect of the number of visitors to the geographic area upon the presence of primitive or                            unconfined recreation, otherwise boundary adjustments should be performed in accordance                            with Subsection     c  iv  F                                   F   in addition to the actions required by the review for roads pursuant to the                            definitions of roads contained in BLM Manual H     , or any similar authority, the BLM                            should, pursuant to its authority to inventory, identify and list all roads or routes identified as                            part of a local or state governmental transportation system, and consider those routes or roads                            as qualifying as roads within the definition of the Wilderness Act of       and                                 G   BLM should adjust the boundaries for a geographic area to exclude areas that do                            not meet the criteria of lacking roads, lacking solitude, and lacking primitive and unconfined                            recreation and the boundaries should be redrawn to reflect an area that clearly meets the criteria                               above, and which does not employ minor adjustments to simply exclude small areas with                            human intrusions, specifically                                  I   the boundaries of a proposed geographic area containing lands with wilderness                            characteristics should not be drawn around roads, rights of way, and intrusions  and                                 II   lands located between individual human impacts that do not meet the requirements                            for lands with wilderness characteristics should be excluded                                  v   BLM should consider the responses of the Department of the Interior under cover                            of the letter dated May   ,     , clearly stating that BLM does not have the authority to apply                            the nonimpairment management standard to the subject lands, or to manage the subject lands in                            any manner to preserve their suitability for designation as wilderness, when considering the                            proper management principles for areas that meet the full definition of lands with wilderness                            characteristics  and                                 vi   even if the BLM were to properly inventory an area for the presence of wilderness                            characteristics, the BLM still lacks authority to make or alter project level decisions to                            automatically avoid impairment of any wilderness characteristics without express                            congressional authority to do so                                  d   achieve and maintain at the highest reasonably sustainable levels a continuing yield                            of energy, hard rock, and nuclear resources in those subject lands with economically                            recoverable amounts of such resources as follows                                  i   the development of the solid, fluid, and gaseous mineral resources in portions of the                            subject lands is an important part of the state s economy and the economies of the respective                            counties, and should be recognized that it is technically feasible to access mineral and energy                            resources in portions of the subject lands while preserving or, as necessary, restoring                            nonmineral and nonenergy resources                                  ii   all available, recoverable solid, fluid, gaseous, and nuclear mineral resources in the                            subject lands should be seriously considered for contribution or potential contribution to the                            state s economy and the economies of the respective counties                                  iii   those portions of the subject lands shown to have reasonable mineral, energy, and                            nuclear potential should be open to leasing, drilling, and other access with reasonable                            stipulations and conditions, including mitigation, reclamation, and bonding measures where                            necessary, that will protect the lands against unnecessary and undue damage to other significant                               resource values                                  iv   federal oil and gas existing lease conditions and restrictions should not be                            modified, waived, or removed unless the lease conditions or restrictions are no longer                            necessary or effective                                  v   any prior existing lease restrictions in the subject lands that are no longer necessary                            or effective should be modified, waived, or removed                                  vi   restrictions against surface occupancy should be eliminated, modified, or waived,                            where reasonable                                  vii   in the case of surface occupancy restrictions that cannot be reasonably eliminated,                            modified, or waived, directional drilling should be considered where the mineral and energy                            resources beneath the area can be reached employing available directional drilling technology                                  viii   applications for permission to drill in the subject lands that meet standard                            qualifications, including reasonable and effective mitigation and reclamation requirements,                            should be expeditiously processed and granted  and                                 ix   any moratorium that may exist against the issuance of qualified mining patents and                            oil and gas leases in the subject lands, and any barriers that may exist against developing                            unpatented mining claims and filing for new claims, should be carefully evaluated for removal                                  e   achieve and maintain livestock grazing in the subject lands at the highest reasonably                            sustainable levels by adhering to the policies, goals, and management practices set forth in                            Subsection      J               m                                   f   manage the watershed in the subject lands to achieve and maintain water resources

trails in the subject lands for the use of an OHV, as closing the                            subject lands to all OHV use will only spur increased and unauthorized use  and
