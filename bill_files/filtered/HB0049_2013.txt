       c   Beginning on or after January  ,     , a school district may receive state support in                           accordance with Subsection     without complying with the requirements of Subsection     b                            if the local school board imposed a tax in accordance with this section during the taxable year                           beginning on January  ,      and ending on December   ,     .                                    a   In addition to the revenue a school district collects from the imposition of a levy                           pursuant to this

value if a school district levies a tax rate under both programs.                                c   i   Beginning July  ,     , the    .   guarantee under Subsections     a  and  b                            shall be indexed each year to the value of the weighted pupil unit for the grades   through                              program by making the value of the guarantee equal to.       times the value of the prior                              year s weighted pupil unit for the grades   through    program.                                ii   The guarantee shall increase by .     times the value of the prior year s weighted                           pupil unit for the grades   through    program for each succeeding year subject to the                           Legislature appropriating funds for an increase in the guarantee.                                d   i   The amount of state guarantee money to which a school district would otherwise                           be entitled to receive under this Subsection     may not be reduced for the sole reason that the                           district s levy is reduced as a consequence of changes in the certified tax rate under Section                                         pursuant to changes in property valuation.                                ii   Subsection     d  i  applies for a period of five years following any such change in                           the certified tax rate.                                e   The guarantee provided under this section does not apply to the portion of a voted                           local levy rate that exceeds the voted local levy rate that was in effect for the previous fiscal                           year, unless an increase in the voted local levy rate was authorized in an election conducted on                           or after July   of the previous fiscal year and before December   of the previous fiscal year.                                f   i   If the appropriation for the state contribution to the voted local levy and board                          local levy programs exceeds the amount necessary to provide the state guarantee per weighted                          pupil unit as determined under this section and Section       A   a        , the State Board of                          Education shall                                 A   use the excess appropriation to increase the value of the state guarantee per                          weighted pupil unit described in Subsection     c   and                                B   distribute the full appropriation for the state contribution to the voted and local                          levy programs to school districts based on the increased value of the state guarantee per                          weighted pupil unit described in Subsection     f  i  A .                                ii   The State Board of Education shall report action taken under this Subsection     f                           to the Office of the Legislative Fiscal Analyst and the Governor s Office of Planning and                          Budget.                                    a   An election to modify an existing voted local levy is not a reconsideration of the                           existing authority unless the proposition submitted to the electors expressly so states.                                b   A majority vote opposing a modification does not deprive the district of authority to                           continue the levy.                                c   If adoption of a voted local levy is contingent upon an offset reducing other local                              school board levies, the board must allow the electors, in an election, to consider modifying or                           discontinuing the imposition of the levy prior to a subsequent increase in other levies that                           would increase the total local school board levy.                                d   Nothing contained in this section terminates, without an election, the authority of a                           school district to continue imposing an existing voted local levy previously authorized by the                           voters as a voted leeway program.                                    Notwithstanding Section                 , a school district may budget an increased                           amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from a voted local levy imposed under this                           section in addition to revenue from new growth as defined in Subsection                    , without                           having to comply with the notice requirements of Section                 , if                                  a   the voted local levy is approved                                  i   in accordance with Subsections     and     on or after January  ,       and                                 ii   within the four year period immediately preceding the year in which the school                            district seeks to budget an increased amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from                            the voted local levy  and                                 b   for a voted local levy approved or modified in accordance with this section on or                            after January  ,     , the school district complies with the requirements of Subsection    .                                     Notwithstanding Section                 , a school district may levy a tax rate under this                            section that exceeds the certified tax rate without having to comply with the notice                            requirements of Section                  if                                  a   the levy exceeds the certified tax rate as the result of a school district budgeting an                            increased amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from a voted local levy imposed                            under this section                                  b   the voted local levy was approved                                  i   in accordance with Subsections     and     on or after January  ,       and                                 ii   within the four year period immediately preceding the year in which the school                            district seeks to budget an increased amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from                            the voted local levy  and                                 c   for a voted local levy approved or modified in accordance with this section on or                            after January  ,     , the school district complies with requirements of Subsection    .
