may apply, in an amount not to exceed the service charge imposed by Section                for                           dishonored instruments if                                 i   any amount due

as  it may be able to obtain.                                b   The division shall give written notice of the determination to the employer.                                c   The determination is considered correct unless                                 i   the employer, within ten days after mailing or personal delivery of notice of the                           determination, applies to the division for a review of the determination as provided in Section                              A            or                                ii   unless the division or its authorized representative of its own motion reviews the                           determination.                                d   The amount of contribution so determined shall be subject to penalties and interest as                           provided in Subsection    .                                    a   If, after due notice,  any  an employer defaults in  any  the payment of                           contributions, interest, or penalties on the contributions, or  any  a claimant defaults in  any  a                           repayment of benefit overpayments and penalties on the overpayments, the amount due shall be                           collectible by civil action in the name of the division, and the employer adjudged in default shall                           pay the costs of the action.                                b   Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions, interest or penalties                           from an employer, or benefit overpayments and penalties from a

C   The notice shall advise the employer or claimant of the employer s or claimant s rights                           under this chapter and the applicable rules  applicable  of the department.                                ii   A   A private collector may receive as compensation up to , but no more than,                                   of the lesser of the amount collected or the amount due, plus the costs and fees of any civil action                           or postjudgment remedy instituted by the private collector with the approval of the division.                                B   The employer or claimant shall be liable to pay the compensation of the collector,                           costs, and fees in addition to the original amount due.                                iii   A private collector is subject to the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,                              U.S.C. Sec.      et seq.                                iv   A   A civil action may not be maintained by any private collector without specific                           prior written approval of the division.                                B   When division approval is given for civil action against an employer or claimant, the                           division may cooperate with the private collector to the extent necessary to effect

necessary in any civil action to enforce collection of the amounts due.                                 e  An action taken by the division under this section may not be construed to be an                            election to forego other collection procedures by the division.                                     a   In the event of  any  a distribution of an employer s assets under an order of

thereafter due shall be entitled to the priority provided for taxes,                            interest, and penalties in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of     .                                     a   In addition and as an alternative to any other remedy provided by this chapter and                            provided that no appeal or other proceeding for review provided by this chapter is then pending                            and the time for taking it has expired, the division may issue a warrant in duplicate, under its                               official seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding the sheriff to levy upon                            and sell the real and personal property of a delinquent employer or claimant found within the                            sheriff s county for the payment of the contributions due thereon, with the added penalties, interest,                            or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs, and to return the warrant to the division and pay                            into the fund the money collected by virtue of the warrant by a time to be  therein  specified in the                           warrant, not more than    days from the date of the warrant.                                 b   i   Immediately upon receipt of the warrant in duplicate, the sheriff shall file the                            duplicate with the clerk of the district court in the sheriff s county.                                 ii   The clerk shall enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors,

interest, or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs,                            for which the warrant is issued and the date when the duplicate is filed.                                 c   The amount of the docketed warrant  so docketed  shall                                  i   have the force and effect of an execution against all personal property of the delinquent                            employer  and                                 ii   become a lien upon the real property of the delinquent employer or claimant in the                            same manner and to the same extent as a judgment duly rendered by  any  a district court and                            docketed in the office of the clerk.                                 d   After docketing, the sheriff shall                                  i   proceed in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to execution issued                            against property upon judgments of a court of record  and

A judgment lien does not include the determination or assessment of a quasi judicial                            authority, such as a state or federal taxing authority.                                 ii    Mechanics  lien holder  means any person who has a lien on real property, or on the                            proceeds of a contract relating to real property, for services, labor, or materials furnished in                            connection with the construction or improvement of the property.

A                            security interest exists at any time                                  A   the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under the law against                            a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation  and                                 B   to the extent that, at that time, the holder has parted with money or money s worth.
