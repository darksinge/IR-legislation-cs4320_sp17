Section          is amended to read                       .  Termination of lease or rental agreement    Required contents of lease              Increases in rents or fees    Sale of homes.                   A mobile home park or its agents may not terminate a lease or rental agreement upon          any ground other than as specified in this chapter.                   At the conclusion of its term, or in the case of a month to month lease at any time, a          lease may be terminated by the mobile home park after no less than    days written notice to the          resident of the mobile home park s intention not to renew the resident s lease.  If at the end of the            days the resident has not returned the mobile home space to the mobile home park, eviction         proceedings may be initiated immediately.                        Each agreement for the lease of mobile home space shall be written and signed         by the parties.  Each lease shall contain at least the following information               a   the name and address of the mobile home park owner and any persons authorized to         act for the owner, upon whom notice and service of process may be served               b   the type of the leasehold, and whether it be term or periodic               c   a full disclosure of all rent, service charges, and other fees presently being charged on          a periodic basis                d   the date or dates on which the payment of rent, fees, and service charges are due  and               e   all rules that pertain to the mobile home park which, if broken, may constitute grounds          for eviction.                         Increases in rent or fees for periodic tenancies shall be unenforceable until             days after notice of the increase is mailed to the resident.  If service charges are not included in the          rent, service charges may be increased during the leasehold period after notice to the resident is          given, and increases or decreases in  electricity rates shall be passed through to the resident.           Increases or decreases in the total cost of other service charges shall be passed through to the          resident.

Any rule or condition of a lease purporting to prevent or unreasonably limit the          sale of a mobile home belonging to a resident is void and unenforceable.  The mobile home park          may, however, reserve the right to approve the prospective purchaser of a mobile home who          intends to become a resident, but such approval may not be unreasonably withheld.  The mobile          home park may require proof of ownership as a condition of approval.

A mobile home park may not restrict a resident s right to advertise for sale or sell          his mobile home.  However, the park may limit the size of a  for sale  sign affixed to the mobile          home to not more than     square inches.                                A mobile home park may not compel a resident who desires to sell his mobile         home, either directly or indirectly, to sell it through an agent designated by the mobile home park.                        In order to upgrade the quality of a mobile home park, it may require that a         mobile home be removed from the park upon sale if               a   the mobile home does not meet minimum size specifications  or              b   the mobile home is in rundown condition or in disrepair.
