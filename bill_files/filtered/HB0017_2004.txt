Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM   This bill has certain residency or in state requirements.  These requirements might raise issues  under trade agreements and constitutional principles. These requirements might be challenged  as violating equal protection, substantive due process, or privileges and immunities because it  limits a person s ability to be a incorporator or director of the corporation based on residency.   However, states may impose such requirements if the requirements are narrowly tailored to  further a substantial state interest.  These requirements might also be challenged under the  commerce clause because they favor in state companies.  In this context, the state may impose  such restrictions if they further a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by  means less restrictive on out of state interests.
