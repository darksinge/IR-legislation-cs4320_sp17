When a minor has been committed by the court to the physical custody of a local                           mental health authority or its designee or to the Utah State Developmental Center, the local                           mental health authority or its designee or the superintendent of the Utah State Developmental                           Center shall give the court written notice of its intention to discharge, release, or parole the                           minor not fewer than five days prior to the discharge, release, or parole.

The receiving court has the same powers with                           respect to the minor that it would have if the proceedings originated in that court.
