          infirmities or disabilities rendering it unsafe for the person to drive a motor vehicle upon the                            highways                                  d   has committed a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws of this state                                  e   has knowingly  acquired, used, displayed, or transferred an item that purports to be                           an authentic driver license certificate issued by a governmental entity if the item is not an                           authentic driver license certificate or has permitted an unlawful use of the license as prohibited                           under  committed a violation of Section                   or                                    f   has been convicted of serious offenses against traffic laws governing the movement                            of motor vehicles with a frequency that indicates a disrespect for traffic laws and a disregard                            for the safety of other persons on the highways.                                     a   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     when the                            person has failed to comply with the terms stated on a traffic citation issued in this state, except                            this Subsection     does not apply to highway weight limit violations or violations of law                            governing the transportation of hazardous materials.                                 b   This Subsection     applies to parking and standing violations only if a court has                            issued a warrant for the arrest of a person for failure to post bail, appear, or otherwise satisfy                            the terms of the citation.                                 c   i   This Subsection     may not be exercised unless notice of the pending                            suspension of the driving privilege has been sent at least    days previously to the person at the                            address provided to the division.                                 ii   After clearance by the division, a report authorized by Section                  may not                            contain any evidence of a suspension that occurred as a result of failure to comply with the                            terms stated on a traffic citation.                                     a   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     when the                            division has been notified by a court that the person has an outstanding unpaid fine, an                            outstanding incomplete restitution requirement, or an outstanding warrant levied by order of a                            court.                                 b   The suspension remains in effect until the division is notified by the court that the                            order has been satisfied.                                 c   After clearance by the division, a report authorized by Section                  may not                            contain any evidence of the suspension.                                     a   The division shall make rules establishing a point system as provided for in this                            Subsection    .                                 b   i   The division shall assign a number of points to each type of moving traffic                            violation as a measure of its seriousness.                                    ii   The points shall be based upon actual relationships between types of traffic                            violations and motor vehicle traffic accidents.                                 iii   Except as provided in Subsection     b  iv , the division may not assess points                            against a person s driving record for a conviction of a traffic violation                                  A   that occurred in another state  and                                 B   that was committed on or after July  ,     .                                 iv   The provisions of Subsection     b  iii  do not apply to                                  A   a reckless or impaired driving violation or a speeding violation for exceeding the                            posted speed limit by    or more miles per hour  or                                 B   an offense committed in another state which, if committed within Utah, would                            result in the mandatory suspension or revocation of a license upon conviction under Section                                         .                                 c   Every person convicted of a traffic violation shall have assessed against the person s                            driving record the number of points that the division has assigned to the type of violation of                            which the person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be                            decreased by     if on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded                            the severity of violation as minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court                            has graded the severity of violation as maximum.                                 d   i   A separate procedure for assessing points for speeding offenses shall be                            established by the division based upon the severity of the offense.                                 ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as                                  A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to    miles per hour                                  B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from    to    miles per                            hour  and                                 C    maximum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by    or more miles per hour.                                 iii   Consideration shall be made for assessment of no points on minimum speeding                            violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.                                 e   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations                               occurring before a time limit set by the division.                                 ii   The time limit may not exceed three years.                                 iii   The division may also delete points to reward violation free driving for periods of                            time set by the division.                                 f   i   By publication in two newspapers having general circulation throughout the                            state, the division shall give notice of the number of points it has assigned to each type of                            traffic violation, the time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level                            at which the division will generally take action to deny or suspend under this section.                                 ii   The division may not change any of the information provided above regarding                            points without first giving new notice in the same manner.                                     a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the                            division shall immediately notify the licensee in a manner specified by the division and afford                            him an opportunity for a hearing in the county where the licensee resides.                                 ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may                            administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of                            relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.                                 iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision                            made after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made                            after a hearing before the full membership of the division.                                 iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,                            extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.                                 b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications                            determined by the division regarding a person                                  i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination                                  ii   who is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle                                  iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities that might make him dangerous                            on the highways  or                                 iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to drive a motor vehicle safely.                                        a   Subject to Subsection     d , the division shall suspend a person s license when                            the division receives notice from the Office of Recovery Services that the Office of Recovery                            Services has ordered the suspension of the person s license.                                 b   A suspension under Subsection     a  shall remain in effect until the division                            receives notice from the Office of Recovery Services that the Office of Recovery Services has                            rescinded the order of suspension.                                 c   After an order of suspension is rescinded under Subsection     b , a report                            authorized by Section                  may not contain any evidence of the suspension.                                 d   i   If the division suspends a person s license under this Subsection    , the division                            shall, upon application, issue a temporary limited driver license to the person if that person                            needs a driver license for employment, education, or child visitation.                                 ii   The temporary limited driver license described in this section                                  A   shall provide that the person may operate a motor vehicle only for the purpose of                            driving to or from the person s place of employment, education, or child visitation                                  B   shall prohibit the person from driving a motor vehicle for any purpose other than a                            purpose described in Subsection     d  ii  A   and                                 C   shall expire    days after the day on which the temporary limited driver license is                            issued.                                 iii   A   During the period beginning on the day on which a temporary limited driver                            license is issued under this Subsection    , and ending on the day that the temporary limited                            driver license expires, the suspension described in this Subsection     only applies if the person                            who is suspended operates a motor vehicle for a purpose other than employment, education, or                            child visitation.                                 B   Upon expiration of a temporary limited driver license described in this Subsection                                d                                   I   a suspension described in Subsection     a  shall be in full effect until the division                            receives notice, under Subsection     b , that the order of suspension is rescinded  and                                 II   a person suspended under Subsection     a  may not drive a motor vehicle for any                               reason.                                 iv   The division is not required to issue a limited driver license to a person under this                            Subsection     d  if there are other legal grounds for the suspension of the person s driver                            license.                                 v   The division shall make rules, in accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah                            Administrative Rulemaking Act, to implement the provisions of this part.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state                            upon receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed                            there that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a                            license.                                 b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                            nonresident driver of a motor vehicle or motorboat of any offense under the motor vehicle laws                            of this state, forward a certified copy of the record to the motor vehicle administrator in the                            state where the person convicted is a resident.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a                            motor vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be                            suspended or revoked.                                 b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when the person s                            license has been suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                                     a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of                            more than one year except                                  i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                                      ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges                            under Section                                                   iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports                            under Subsection                                                      iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section                                  a                                             v   when the division suspends the license under Subsection      or                                 vi   when the division denies the license under Subsection     .                                 b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until the                            person shows satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                            Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any                            person without hearing and without receiving a record of the person s conviction for a crime                            when the division has reason to believe that the person s license was granted by the division                            through error or fraud or that the necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is                            terminated.                                 b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that                            after the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                      a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is                            incompetent or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified                            by the  division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                 b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                            person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction                            imposed in accordance with Section                 .                                 c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                            suspension or revocation of the licensee s license.                                      a   Except as provided in Subsection      b , a report authorized by Section                                          may not contain any evidence of a conviction for speeding on an interstate system in
