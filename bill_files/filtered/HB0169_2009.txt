         industries by utilizing proven techniques and tools are vital to the state s economy and the                            quality of life in Utah  and                                 m   i   land management plans, programs, and initiatives should provide that the                            amount of domestic livestock forage, expressed in animal unit months, for permitted, active                            use as well as the wildlife forage included in that amount, be no less than the maximum                            number of animal unit months sustainable by range conditions in grazing allotments and                            districts, based on an on the ground and scientific analysis                                  ii   the state opposes the relinquishment or retirement of grazing animal unit months in                            favor of conservation, wildlife, and other uses                                  iii   A   the state favors the best management practices that are jointly sponsored by                            cattlemen s, sportsmen s, and wildlife management groups such as chaining, logging, seeding,                            burning, and other direct soil and vegetation prescriptions that are demonstrated to restore                            forest and rangeland health,  increase forage, and improve watersheds in grazing districts and                            allotments for the mutual benefit of domestic livestock and wildlife                                  B   when practices described in Subsection     m  iii  A  increase a grazing                            allotment s forage beyond the total permitted forage use that was allocated to that allotment in                               the last federal land use plan or allotment management plan still in existence as of January  ,                                , a reasonable and fair portion of the increase in forage beyond the previously allocated                            total permitted use should be allocated to wildlife as recommended by a joint, evenly balanced                            committee of livestock and wildlife representatives that is appointed and constituted by the                            governor for that purpose                                  C   the state favors quickly and effectively adjusting wildlife population goals and                            population census numbers in response to variations in the amount of available forage caused                            by drought or other climatic adjustments, and state agencies responsible for managing wildlife                            population goals and population census numbers will give due regard to both the needs of the                            livestock industry and the need to prevent the decline of species to a point where listing under                            the terms of the Endangered Species Act when making such adjustments                                  iv   the state opposes the transfer of grazing animal unit months to wildlife for                            supposed reasons of rangeland health                                  v   reductions in domestic livestock animal unit months must be temporary and                            scientifically based upon rangeland conditions                                  vi   policies, plans, programs, initiatives, resource management plans, and forest plans                            may not allow the placement of grazing animal unit months in a suspended use category unless                            there is a rational and scientific determination that the condition of the rangeland allotment or                            district in question will not sustain the animal unit months sought to be placed in suspended                            use                                  vii   any grazing animal unit months that are placed in a suspended use category should                            be returned to active use when range conditions improve                                  viii   policies, plans, programs, and initiatives related to vegetation management                            should recognize and uphold the preference for domestic grazing over alternate forage uses in                            established grazing districts while upholding management practices that optimize and expand                            forage for grazing and wildlife in conjunction with state wildlife management plans and                            programs in order to provide maximum available forage for all uses  and                                 ix   in established grazing districts, animal unit months that have been reduced due to                            rangeland health concerns should be restored to livestock when rangeland conditions improve,                            and should not be converted to wildlife use.
