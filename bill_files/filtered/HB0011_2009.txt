to the lien of real estate taxes                            imposed upon the land.                                      a   The division may fill any voids, seal any abandoned tunnels, shafts, and

lands or coal development impacts have been met, except for                            those reclamation projects relating to the protection of the public health or safety.                                 c   In those instances where mine waste piles are being reworked for conservation                            purposes, the incremental costs of disposing of the wastes from these operations by filling                            voids and sealing tunnels may be eligible for funding if the disposal of these wastes meets the                            purposes of this section.                                 d   The division may acquire by purchase, donation, easement, or otherwise those                            interests in land it determines necessary to carry out the provisions of this

        ii   The extent of this control and treatment of water pollution may be dependent upon                            the ultimate use of the water.                                 iii   This
