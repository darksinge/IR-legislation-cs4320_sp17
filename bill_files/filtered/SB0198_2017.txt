B   In accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, the         commission may make rules for determining the amount of tax due under Subsection     h  i          if the London fixing price is not available for a particular day.                   a   Except as provided in Subsections     through     and Section          , the         sales or use tax imposed by this chapter is due and payable to the commission quarterly on or         before the last day of the month next succeeding each calendar quarterly period.               b   i   Each seller shall, on or before the last day of the month next succeeding each         calendar quarterly period, file with the commission a return for the preceding quarterly period.               ii   The seller shall remit with the return under Subsection     b  i  the amount of the         tax required under this chapter to be collected or paid for the period covered by the return.               c   Except as provided in Subsection     c , a return shall contain information and be in         a form the commission prescribes by rule.               d   i   Subject to Subsection     d  ii , the sales tax as computed in the return shall be         based on the total nonexempt sales made during the period for which the return is filed,         including both cash and charge sales.               ii   For a sale that includes the delivery or installation of tangible personal property at a         location other than a seller s place of business described in Subsection     a  i , if the delivery         or installation is separately stated on an invoice or receipt, a seller may compute the tax due on         the sale for purposes of Subsection     d  i  based on the amount the seller receives for that         sale during each period for which the seller receives payment for the sale.               e   i  The use tax as computed in the return shall be based on the total amount of         purchases for storage, use, or other consumption in this state made during the period for which         the return is filed, including both cash and charge purchases.               ii   A   As used in this Subsection     e  ii ,  qualifying purchaser  means a purchaser         who is required to remit taxes under this chapter, but is not required to remit taxes monthly in         accordance with Section          , and who converts tangible personal property into real         property.               B   Subject to Subsections     e  ii  C  and  D , a qualifying purchaser may remit the         taxes due under this chapter on tangible personal property for which the qualifying purchaser         claims an exemption as allowed under Subsection               or      based on the period in         which the qualifying purchaser receives payment, in accordance with Subsection     e  ii  C ,         for the conversion of the tangible personal property into real property.               C   A qualifying purchaser remitting taxes due under this chapter in accordance with         Subsection     e  ii  B  shall remit an amount equal to the total amount of tax due on the         qualifying purchaser s purchase of the tangible personal property that was converted into real         property multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payment received in the period         for the qualifying purchaser s sale of the tangible personal property that was converted into real         property and the denominator of which is the entire sales price for the qualifying purchaser s         sale of the tangible personal property that was converted into real property.               D   A qualifying purchaser may remit taxes due under this chapter in accordance with         this Subsection     e  ii  only if the books and records that the qualifying purchaser keeps in         the qualifying purchaser s regular course of business identify by reasonable and verifiable         standards that the tangible personal property was converted into real property.               f   i   Subject to Subsection     f  ii  and in accordance with Title   G, Chapter  ,         Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, the commission may by rule extend the time for making         returns and paying the taxes.               ii   An extension under Subsection     f  i  may not be for more than    days.               g   The commission may require returns and payment of the tax to be made for other         than quarterly periods if the commission considers it necessary in order to ensure the payment         of the tax imposed by this chapter.               h   i   The commission may require a seller that files a simplified electronic return with         the commission to file an additional electronic report with the commission.               ii   In accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, the         commission may make rules providing                A   the information required to be included in the additional electronic report described         in Subsection     h  i   and               B   one or more due dates for filing the additional electronic report described in         Subsection     h  i .                   a   As used in this Subsection     and Subsection     b ,  remote seller  means a         seller that is                i   registered under the agreement                ii   described in Subsection     c   and               iii   not a                A   model   seller                B   model   seller  or               C   model   seller.               b   i   Except as provided in Subsection     b  ii , a tax a remote seller collects in         accordance with Subsection     c  is due and payable                A   to the commission                B   annually  and               C   on or before the last day of the month immediately following the last day of each         calendar year.               ii   The commission may require that a tax a remote seller collects in accordance with         Subsection     c  be due and payable                A   to the commission  and               B   on the last day of the month immediately following any month in which the seller         accumulates a total of at least   ,    in agreement sales and use tax.               c   i   If a remote seller remits a tax to the commission in accordance with Subsection             b , the remote seller shall file a return                A   with the commission                B   with respect to the tax                C   containing information prescribed by the commission  and               D   on a form prescribed by the commission.               ii   In accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, the         commission shall make rules prescribing                A   the information required to be contained in a return described in Subsection             c  i   and               B   the form described in Subsection     c  i  D .               d   A tax a remote seller collects in accordance with this Subsection     shall be         calculated on the basis of the total amount of taxable transactions under Subsection                      the remote seller completes, including                i   a cash transaction  and               ii   a charge transaction.                   a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , a tax a seller that files a simplified         electronic return collects in accordance with this chapter is due and payable                i   monthly on or before the last day of the month immediately following the month for         which the seller collects a tax under this chapter  and               ii   for the month for which the seller collects a tax under this chapter.               b   A tax a remote seller that files a simplified electronic return collects in accordance         with this chapter is due and payable as provided in Subsection    .                   a   On each vehicle sale made by other than a regular licensed vehicle dealer, the         purchaser shall pay the sales or use tax directly to the commission if the vehicle is subject to         titling or registration under the laws of this state.               b   The commission shall collect the tax described in Subsection     a  when the         vehicle is titled or registered.                   If any sale of tangible personal property or any other taxable transaction under         Subsection             , is made by a wholesaler to a retailer, the wholesaler is not         responsible for the collection or payment of the tax imposed on the sale and the retailer is         responsible for the collection or payment of the tax imposed on the sale if                a   the retailer represents that the personal property is purchased by the retailer for         resale  and               b   the personal property is not subsequently resold.                   If any sale of property or service subject to the tax is made to a person prepaying         sales or use tax in accordance with Title   M, Chapter  , Resource Development Act, or to a         contractor or subcontractor of that person, the person to whom such payment or consideration         is payable is not responsible for the collection or payment of the sales or use tax and the person         prepaying the sales or use tax is responsible for the collection or payment of the sales or use tax         if the person prepaying the sales or use tax represents that the amount prepaid as

    debt on behalf of the seller                i   in accordance with this Subsection       and               ii   if the certified service provider credits or refunds the entire amount of the bad debt         deduction or refund to the seller.               i   A seller may allocate bad debt among the states that are members of the agreement         if the seller s books and records support that allocation.                    a   A seller may not, with intent to evade any tax, fail to timely remit the full         amount of tax required by this chapter.               b   A violation of
