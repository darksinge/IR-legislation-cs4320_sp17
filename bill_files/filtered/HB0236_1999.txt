renders the person incapable of safely operating a vehicle.                                b   The fact that a person charged with violating this section is or has been legally entitled                           to use alcohol or a drug is not a defense against any charge of violating this section.                                c   Alcohol concentration in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per                               milliliters of blood, and alcohol concentration in the breath shall be based upon grams of alcohol                           per     liters of breath.
