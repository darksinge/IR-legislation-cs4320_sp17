With respect to the price of a                          competitor, the price must be one at which the competitor offered the goods or services for sale                          in the product area at the time of the price assessment, and must not be an isolated price.                                  o    A person  represents as independent an audit, accounting, price assessment, or                           comparison of prices of goods or services, when  such  the audit, accounting, price assessment,                           or comparison is not independent .  Such audit, accounting, price assessment, or comparison                          shall be independent if the price assessor randomly selects the goods to be compared, and the                          time and place of such comparison, and no agreement or understanding exists between the                          supplier and the price assessor that could cause the results of the assessment to be fraudulent or                          deceptive.  The independence of such audit, accounting, or price comparison is not invalidated                          merely because the advertiser pays a fee therefor, but is invalidated if the audit, accounting, or                          price comparison is done by a full or part time employee of the advertiser.                                  p    A person  represents, in an advertisement of a reduction from the supplier s own                           prices, that the reduction is from a regular price, when the former price is not a regular price as                           defined in Subsection          a           .                                  q    A person  advertises a price comparison or the result of a price assessment or                           comparison that uses, in any way, an identified competitor s price without clearly and                           conspicuously disclosing the identity of the price assessor and any relationship between the                           price assessor and the supplier .  Examples of disclosure complying with this section are                            Price assessment performed by Store Z    Price assessment performed by a certified public                          accounting firm    Price assessment performed by employee of Store Y.                                   r    A person  makes a price comparison between a category of the supplier s goods                           and the same category of the goods of another, without randomly selecting the individual goods                           or services upon whose prices the comparison is based .   For the purposes of this subsection,                             goods or services are randomly selected when the supplier has no advance knowledge of what                          goods and services will be surveyed by the price assessor, and when the supplier certifies its                          lack of advance knowledge by an affidavit to be retained in the supplier s records for one year.                                  s    A person  makes a comparison between similar but nonidentical goods or services                           unless the nonidentical goods or services are of essentially similar quality to the advertised                           goods or services or the dissimilar aspects are clearly and conspicuously disclosed in the                           advertisements .  It is prima facie evidence of compliance with this subsection if    or                                 i   the goods compared are substantially the same size  and                                  ii   the goods compared are of substantially the same quality, which may include                          similar models of competing brands of goods, or goods made of substantially the same                           materials and made with substantially the same workmanship.  It is prima facie evidence of a                           deceptive comparison under this section when the prices of brand name goods and generic                           goods are compared.                                  t    A person  engages in any other conduct which similarly creates a likelihood of                            confusion or of misunderstanding.                                     a   For purposes of Subsection     i , if a specific advertised price will be in effect                           for less than one week from the advertisement date, the advertisement must clearly and                           conspicuously disclose the specific time period during which the price will be in effect.                                 b   For purposes of Subsection     l , with respect to the price of a competitor, the                           price must be one at which the competitor offered the goods or services for sale in the product                           area at the time of the price assessment, and must not be an isolated price.                                 c   For purposes of Subsection     o , an audit, accounting, price assessment, or                           comparison shall be independent if the price assessor randomly selects the goods to be                           compared, and the time and place of the comparison, and no agreement or understanding exists                           between the supplier and the price assessor that could cause the results of the assessment to be                           fraudulent or deceptive.  The independence of an audit, accounting, or price comparison is not                           invalidated merely because the advertiser pays a fee for the audit, accounting, or price                           comparison, but is invalidated if the audit, accounting, or price comparison is done by a full or                           part time employee of the advertiser.                                 d   Examples of a disclosure that complies with Subsection     q  are                                  i    Price assessment performed by Store Z                                      ii    Price assessment performed by a certified public accounting firm   or                                 iii    Price assessment performed by employee of Store Y.                                  e   For the purposes of Subsection     r , goods or services are randomly selected when                           the supplier has no advance knowledge of what goods and services will be surveyed by the                           price assessor, and when the supplier certifies its lack of advance knowledge by an affidavit to                           be retained in the supplier s records for one year.                                 f   i   It is prima facie evidence of compliance with Subsection     s  if                                  A   the goods compared are substantially the same size  and                                 B   the goods compared are of substantially the same quality, which may include                           similar models of competing brands of goods, or goods made of substantially the same                           materials and made with substantially the same workmanship.                                 ii   It is prima facie evidence of a deceptive comparison under this section when the                           prices of brand name goods and generic goods are compared.                                           Any supplier who makes a comparison with a competitor s price in advertising                            shall maintain for a period of one year records that disclose the factual basis for such price                            comparisons and from which the validity of such claim can be established.                                           It shall be a defense to any claim of false or deceptive price representations                            under this chapter that a person                                  a   has no knowledge that the represented price is not genuine  and                                 b   has made reasonable efforts to determine whether the represented price is genuine.                                           Subsections     m  and  q  do not apply to price comparisons made in catalogs                            in which a supplier compares the price of a single item of its goods or services with those of                            another.                                      In order to       To prevail in an action under this chapter, a complainant need not                            prove competition between the parties or actual confusion or misunderstanding.                                           This chapter does not affect unfair trade practices otherwise actionable at                            common law or under other statutes of this state.
