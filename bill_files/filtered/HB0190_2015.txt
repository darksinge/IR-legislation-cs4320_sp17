Subsection     a , no appeal may be taken from the findings        of a board of equalization.

The failure of an owner of property within the assessment area to appear before the        board of equalization to object or submit in writing before the final hearing of the board an        objection to the levy of the assessment constitutes a waiver of all objections to the levy, except        an objection that the governing body failed to obtain jurisdiction to order that the        improvements which the assessment is intended to pay be provided to the assessment area.                   a   This section may not be interpreted to insulate a local entity from a claim of        misuse of assessment funds.              b   i   Except as provided in Subsection      b  ii , an action in the nature of        mandamus is the sole form of relief available to a party challenging the misuse of assessment        funds.              ii   The limitation in Subsection      b  i  does not prohibit a person from filing        criminal charges against or the prosecution of a party for the misuse of assessment funds.
