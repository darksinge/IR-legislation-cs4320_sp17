Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter or Chapter  , Workers                           Compensation Act, for a claim for compensation under this chapter that meets the requirements                          of Subsection    , there is a rebuttable presumption that a presumptive occupational disease                                 a   arose out of and in the course of line of duty employment  and                                b   is medically caused or aggravated by the line of duty employment described in                          Subsection     a .                                    The presumption described in Subsection     is created if                                    a   the claim for compensation under this chapter is filed within the time periods                          provided in Sections       A           and       A                                           b   the fire department employee for which the claim is filed is employed in the                          line of duty employment                                 i   for at least    months  and                                ii   A   on the day on which the claim for compensation is filed  or                                B   within no more than three years before the day on which the claim for                          compensation is filed                                 c   i   as a condition of being employed in line of duty employment, the fire                          department employee passed a physical examination before the day on which the fire                          department employee made a claim under this chapter for a presumptive occupational disease                           and                                ii   the examination described in Subsection     c  i  did not indicate evidence of a                          presumptive occupational disease  and                                d   the claim for compensation under this chapter is for a presumptive occupational                          disease.                                    If the conditions of Subsection     are met, a fire department employee may rely on                          the presumption described in Subsection     to meet a burden of proof to establish entitlement                          to compensation under this chapter and Chapter  , Workers  Compensation Act.                                    The presumption described in Subsection     may be rebutted if the employer or the                          employer s insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the presumptive                          occupational disease                                 a   did not arise out of and in the course of the line of duty employment  and                                b   was not medically caused or aggravated by the line of duty employment described                          in Subsection     a .                                    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, an employer is not liable for a                          presumptive occupational disease if after a fire department employee is no longer employed in                          the line of duty employment, the fire department employee is injuriously exposed to the                          hazards of the presumptive occupational disease as provided in Section       A          .                                    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, Title   , Chapter  a, Disease                          Testing and Workers  Compensation Presumption for Benefit of Emergency Medical Services                             Providers, governs whether there is or is not a presumption that a disease, as defined in Section                                 a      , is compensable under this chapter or Chapter  , Workers  Compensation Act.                                    This section may not be construed as preventing a fire department employee from                          receiving workers  compensation benefits under this chapter or Chapter  , Workers                           Compensation Act, because the fire department employee fails to meet the requirements under                          this section to establish the rebuttable presumption described in Subsection    .      Legislative Review Note      as of                AM   This bill creates a class consisting of certain firefighters and medical providers of fire  departments. For this class the bill provides a rebuttable presumption that certain diseases  presumptively arose as a result of working for the fire department and therefore are  compensable under workers  compensation statutes. Under equal protection principles of the  Constitution of the United States and the uniform operation of the laws provisions of the Utah  Constitution, there are limits on a legislature s ability to establish classifications and then treat  members of the classes differently. If the classification does not involve certain protected  classes, courts generally apply a rational basis test when reviewing legislative classifications.   In addition, because of the exclusive remedy element of workers  compensation, the open  courts provision of the Utah Constitution may be implicated if the remedies provided under  workers  compensation are found inadequate. In examining the permissibility of classes, courts  look to factors such as the relationship between the class and the legislative objective being  pursued. For example, a court may look at the relationship between the creation of the  presumption and the level of exposure fire department employees may experience because of  the nature of their employment.
