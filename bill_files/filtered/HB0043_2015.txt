As used in this section              a    Public entity  means              i   the United States              ii   an agency of the United States              iii   the state              iv   a state agency              v   a political subdivision of the state  or             vi   an agency of a political subdivision of the state.             b    Public water supplier  means an entity that              i   supplies water, directly or indirectly, to the public for municipal, domestic, or       industrial use  and             ii   is              A   a public entity              B   a water corporation, as defined in Section       , that is regulated by the Public       Service Commission              C   a community water system              I   that              Aa   supplies water to at least     service connections used by year round residents  or             Bb   regularly serves at least     year round residents  and             II   whose voting members              Aa   own a share in the community water system              Bb   receive water from the community water system in proportion to the member s       share in the community water system  and             Cc   pay the rate set by the community water system based on the water the member       receives  or             D   a water users association              I   in which one or more public entities own at least     of the outstanding shares  and             II   that is a local sponsor of a water project constructed by the United States Bureau of       Reclamation.             c    Shareholder  is as defined in Section       . .             d    Water company  is as defined in Section       . .             e    Water supply entity  means an entity that supplies water as a utility service or for       irrigation purposes and is also              i   a municipality, water conservancy district, metropolitan water district, irrigation       district, or other public agency              ii   a water company regulated by the Public Service Commission  or             iii   any other owner of a community water system.                 a  Except as provided in Subsection     b  or  e , when an appropriator or the       appropriator s successor in interest abandons or ceases to use all or a portion of a water right       for a period of seven years, the water right or the unused portion of that water right is subject to       forfeiture in accordance with Subsection     c .             b   i   An appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest may file an       application for nonuse with the state engineer.             ii   If a person described in Subsection     b  i  files and receives approval on a nonuse       application, nonuse of the water right subject to the application is not counted toward a       seven year period described in Subsection     a  during the period of time beginning on the day       on which the person files the application and ending on the day on which the application       expires without being renewed.             iii   If a person described in Subsection     b  i  files and receives approval on       successive, overlapping nonuse applications, nonuse of the water right subject to the       applications is not counted toward a seven year period described in Subsection     a  during       the period of time beginning on the day on which the person files the first application and       ending on the day on which the last application expires without being renewed.             iv   Approval of a nonuse application does not protect a water right that is already       subject to forfeiture under Subsection     a  for full or partial nonuse of the water right.             v   A nonuse application may be filed on all or a portion of the water right, including       water rights held by a water company.             vi   After giving written notice to the water company, a shareholder may file a nonuse       application with the state engineer on the water represented by the stock.             c   i  Except as provided in Subsection     c  ii , a water right or a portion of the water       right may not be forfeited unless a judicial action to declare the right forfeited is commenced       within    years from the end of the latest period of nonuse of at least seven years.             ii   A   The state engineer, in a proposed determination of rights prepared in       accordance with Section        , may not assert that a water right was forfeited unless a period        of nonuse of seven years ends or occurs during the    years immediately preceding the day on        which the state engineer files the proposed determination of rights with the court.              B   After the day on which a proposed determination of rights is filed with the court a        person may not assert that a water right subject to that determination was forfeited during the           year period described in Subsection     c  ii  A , unless the state engineer asserts forfeiture        in the proposed determination, or a person makes, in accordance with Section        , an        objection to the proposed determination that asserts forfeiture.              iii   A water right, found to be valid in a decree entered in an action for general        determination of rights under Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights, is subject to a claim        of forfeiture based on a seven year period of nonuse that begins after the day on which the state        engineer filed the related proposed determination of rights with the court, unless the decree        provides otherwise.              iv   If in a judicial action a court declares a water right forfeited, on the date on which        the water right is forfeited               A   the right to use the water reverts to the public  and              B   the water made available by the forfeiture               I   first, satisfies other water rights in the hydrologic system in order of priority date         and              II   second, may be appropriated as provided in this title.              d    This  Except as provided in Subsection     e , this section applies whether the        unused or abandoned water or a portion of the water is               i   permitted to run to waste  or              ii   used by others without right with the knowledge of the water right holder.              e   This section does not apply to               i   the use of water according to a lease or other agreement with the appropriator or the        appropriator s successor in interest               ii   a water right if its place of use is contracted under an approved state agreement or        federal conservation fallowing program                iii   those periods of time when a surface water or groundwater source fails to yield        sufficient water to satisfy the water right                iii   a water right during a period of time when a surface water source or groundwater        source fails to yield sufficient water to satisfy the water right               iv   a water right when failure to use results from other physical causes beyond the        reasonable control of the water right owner                iv    v   a water right when water is unavailable because of the water right s priority        date                v    vi   a water right to store water in a surface reservoir or an aquifer, in accordance        with Title   , Chapter  b, Groundwater Recharge and Recovery Act, if               A   the water is stored for present or future use  or              B   storage is limited by a safety, regulatory, or engineering restraint that the        appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest cannot reasonably correct                vi    vii   a water right if a water user has beneficially used substantially all of the        water right within a seven year period, provided that this exemption does not apply to the        adjudication of a water right in a general determination of water rights under Chapter  ,        Determination of Water Rights                vii    viii   except as provided by Subsection     g , a water right               A   I   owned by a public water supplier               II   represented by a public water supplier s ownership interest in a water company  or              III   to which a public water supplier owns the right of use  and              B   conserved or held for the reasonable future water requirement of the public, which        is determined according to Subsection     f                 viii    ix   a supplemental water right during a period of time when another water right        available to the appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest provides sufficient water        so as to not require use of the supplemental water right  or               ix    x   a water right subject to an approved change application where the applicant is        diligently pursuing certification.              f   i   The reasonable future water requirement of the public is the amount of water        needed in the next    years by the persons within the public water supplier s projected or        reasonably anticipated service area based on projected or reasonably anticipated population        growth or other water use demand.              ii   For purposes of Subsection     f  i , a community water system s projected or        reasonably anticipated service area               A   is the area served by the community water system s distribution facilities  and              B   expands as the community water system expands the distribution facilities in        accordance with Title   , Chapter  , Safe Drinking Water Act.              g   For a water right acquired by a public water supplier on or after May  ,     ,        Subsection     e   vii   viii  applies if               i   the public water supplier submits a change application under Section         and              ii   the state engineer approves the change application.                  a   The state engineer shall furnish a nonuse application form requiring the        following information               i   the name and address of the applicant               ii   a description of the water right or a portion of the water right, including the point of        diversion, place of use, and priority               iii   the quantity of water               iv   the period of use               v   the extension of time applied for               vi   a statement of the reason for the nonuse of the water  and              vii   any other information that the state engineer requires.              b   i   Upon receipt of the application, the state engineer shall publish a notice of the        application once a week for two successive weeks               A   in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the source of the water        supply is located and where the water is to be used  and              B   as required in Section         .              ii   The notice shall               A   state that an application has been made  and              B   specify where the interested party may obtain additional information relating to the        application.              c   Any interested person may file a written protest with the state engineer against the        granting of the application               i   within    days after the notice is published, if the adjudicative proceeding is        informal  and              ii   within    days after the notice is published, if the adjudicative proceeding is        formal.              d   In any proceedings to determine whether the nonuse application should be        approved or rejected, the state engineer shall follow the procedures and requirements of Title          G, Chapter  , Administrative Procedures Act.              e   After further investigation, the state engineer may approve or reject the application.                  a   The state engineer shall grant a nonuse application on all or a portion of a water        right for a period of time not exceeding seven years if the applicant shows a reasonable cause        for nonuse.              b   A reasonable cause for nonuse includes               i   a demonstrable financial hardship or economic depression               ii   physical causes or changes that render use beyond the reasonable control of the        water right owner                ii

requirements of the public                v    vi   situations where, in the opinion of the state engineer, the nonuse would assist        in implementing an existing, approved water management plan  or               vi    vii   the loss of capacity caused by deterioration of the water supply or delivery        equipment if the applicant submits, with the application, a specific plan to resume full use of        the water right by replacing, restoring, or improving the equipment.                  a   Sixty days before the expiration of a nonuse application, the state engineer shall        notify the applicant by mail or by any form of electronic communication through which receipt        is verifiable, of the date when the nonuse application will expire.              b   An applicant

If a shareholder files a change application and the water company has consented to        the proposed change subject to certain conditions under Subsection     b  ii , but the        shareholder disagrees with one or more conditions described in the response, or if the water        company declines to consent under Subsection     b  iii , or if the water company fails to        respond and the shareholder submits an affidavit of nonresponse under Subsection     b  ii ,        the state engineer shall               a   within    days after the day on which the state engineer receives the change        application, give notice to the shareholder and the water company that both parties are required        to engage in mediation before the state engineer will evaluate the change application  and              b   provide written notice to the water company, if it failed to respond as required        under Subsection     b , that the water company shall respond to the proposed change        application within    days after the day on which the water company receives the notice from        the state engineer, and that failure of the water company to respond constitutes consent to the        proposed change.                  If the water company has not previously responded and fails to respond to the        notice under Subsection     b , the water company s consent to the change application is        established as a matter of law and the state engineer may proceed with the administrative        evaluation under Subsection     .                  a   If the water company has, in writing, declined to consent to the change        application under Subsection     b  iii  or Subsection     b , or has consented on conditions        unacceptable to the shareholder, the parties shall jointly retain the service of a mediator and        schedule a mediation on the change application filed by the shareholder and the response of the        water company.              b   If the shareholder and water company are unable to agree upon a mediator, the        private property rights omsbudsman shall serve in the capacity of mediator.              c   The shareholder and water company shall equally share the costs related to the use        of the mediator for a mediation conducted under Subsection     a .              d   The mediation described in Subsection     a  shall be held within    days of the        day on which the state engineer gives the notice set forth in Subsection     a  if the water        company issued a written response pursuant to Subsection     a , or within    days of the day        on which the water company issues a written response pursuant to Subsection     b .              e   The time for completion of the mediation may be extended for up to    days if the        parties agree and send written notice to the state engineer.              f   Within five days after the day on which the final day of mediation occurs, the        mediator shall send a written statement to the state engineer, with a copy provided to each        party, advising whether the mediation resulted in an agreement between the parties.                  If a shareholder and a water company come to an agreement in a mediation        conducted under Subsection    , the state engineer shall proceed to evaluate the change        application in accordance with Subsection     .                   If the parties do not reach an agreement through mediation and if a mediator s        statement, as described in Subsection     f , is not received within    days following the time        allowed for mediation, either party may send written notice to the other and to the state        engineer that the parties are not in agreement regarding the proposed change application.                   Within    days of the day on which the state engineer receives the written        statement from the mediator under Subsection     f , or the written notice from a party under        Subsection      that the parties are not in agreement regarding the proposed change        application, the shareholder or the water company may file an action in district court to resolve        legal issues not within the purview of the state engineer s evaluation under Subsection     .                   If a court action is not timely filed under Subsection     , or if an action is timely        filed and subsequently resolved and the matter remanded to the state engineer, the state        engineer shall move forward with the administrative proceeding under Subsection     .                   a   The state engineer shall evaluate a shareholder s change application in the same        manner used to evaluate a change application submitted under Section       , using               i   the criteria described in Section                      ii   the considerations described in Subsection     c , related specifically to shareholder        applications  and              iii   the water company s conditions in consenting to the shareholder s proposed change        application.              b   Nothing in this section limits the authority of the state engineer in evaluating and        processing a change application, including the authority to require or allow a shareholder or        water company to submit additional relevant information, if the state engineer finds an absence        of prejudice and allows adequate time and opportunity for the other party to respond.              c   The state engineer may not withhold approval of a change application under this        section based on potential damage, liability, or impairment to the water company or its        shareholders if the potential damage, liability, or impairment can be reasonably mitigated        without cost to the water company.                   If the state engineer approves a shareholder s change application, the state        engineer               a   may condition approval on payment of the water company s reasonable costs        incurred in the transfer process and in making adjustments to the water company s diversion or        delivery system that are necessitated by the approved change application  and              b   for shares included in the approval, require that the shareholder requesting the        change  must  be current on all water company assessments and  agree to                i   continue to pay all reasonably applicable future assessments , except that the        shareholder may choose to prepay any portion of the water company assessments attributable to        an existing debt of the water company. , with credit given to the shareholder for cost savings to        the company  or               b   Other than prepaid assessments, the water company may require that the        shareholder continue to pay all applicable assessments.                    If the water company approves the requested change, with or without conditions,        the change application may be filed with the state engineer, and must                 a   be signed on behalf of the water company  or                b   be accompanied by written authorization from the water company assenting to the        change.                    a   The state engineer may evaluate a change application authorized by a water        company under this section in the same manner and using the same criteria that he or she uses        to evaluate any other change application.                b   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the state engineer in evaluating        and processing any change application.                    If an application authorized by a water company under this section is approved by        the state engineer, the shareholder may file requests for extensions of time to submit proof of        beneficial use under the change application without further permission of the water company.                    a   Change applications approved under this section are subject to all conditions        imposed by the water company and the state engineer.                b   If a shareholder fails to comply with all of the conditions imposed by the water        company, the water company may, after written notice to the shareholder and after allowing        reasonable time to remedy the failure, withdraw its approval of the application, and petition the        state engineer for an order canceling the change application.                c   The water company may not revoke its approval of the change application or seek        an order canceling the application if the conditions are substantially satisfied.                     a   The shareholder requesting the change shall have a cause of action, including        an award of actual damages incurred, against the water company if the water company                 i   unreasonably withholds approval of a requested change                 ii   imposes unreasonable conditions in its approval  or                iii   withdraws approval of a change application in a manner other than as provided in        Subsection    .                b   The action referred to in Subsection      a  shall be referred to mediation by the        court under Title   B, Chapter  , Part  , Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, unless both        parties decline mediation.                c   If mediation is declined, the prevailing party to the action shall be entitled to costs        and reasonable attorney fees.               ii   by mutual agreement only, and when the shares will rely upon a different diversion        and delivery system, negotiate a buyout that includes a pro rata share of the bonded        indebtedness assignable to the shares, together with the capitalized value of anticipated future        assessments for maintenance and operation that otherwise would have applied.                   A shareholder or a water company may obtain de novo judicial review of the state        engineer s determination under Subsections      and      by filing an action in district court        within    days after the day on which the state engineer makes a final determination in the        adjudicative proceeding on the change application.                   If, after a proposed change has been approved and gone into effect, a shareholder        fails to substantially comply with a condition described in Subsection      a  or  b  and        neglects to remedy the failure after written notice from the water company that allows the        shareholder a reasonable opportunity to remedy the failure, that is not less than    days after        the day on which the water company gives notice, the water company may               a   petition the state engineer to order a reversal of the change application approval  or              b  proceed under the remedies provided in Title   , Chapter  , Share Assessment Act.                   If a shareholder s change application is denied by the state engineer and the denial        is upheld by the district court in a de novo action, the district court may award costs and        reasonable attorney fees to the water company if the court finds that               a   the shareholder declined to participate, or failed to cooperate in, the mediation        required under Subsection      or              b   i   the shareholder refused to accept conditions advanced by the water company for        the water company to consent to the proposed change  and              ii   the conditions advanced by the water company for consenting to the shareholder s        change were reasonable and necessary to protect the other shareholders.                   If a shareholder s change application is approved by the state engineer and upheld        by a district court in a de novo action, the district court may award costs and reasonable        attorney fees to the shareholder if the district court finds that the water company               a   declined to participate or failed to cooperate in the mediation required under        Subsection                   b   unreasonably declined to consent to the proposed change  or              c   conditioned its consent to the proposed change on unreasonable requirements.                   The district court may award actual damages to a shareholder beyond costs and        reasonable attorney fees if the district court finds that the water company s acts or decisions        were so unreasonable or indefensible as to constitute bad faith.Legislative Review Note     as of                  AMOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
