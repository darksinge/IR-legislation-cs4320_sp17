Section            is amended to read                       .  Title.            This chapter is known as the   Utah  Legislative Oversight and Sunset Act.              Section  .  Section            is amended to read                       .  Agency defined    Periodic termination of statutes and agencies            Legislative review.                 As used in this chapter,  agency  means any state authority, board, commission,        department, division, office, or other agency, and the statute  or rule  that established it.                 The Legislature finds that the state should not regulate any area unless the regulation is        necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.                 In order to make state government more productive and responsive to the people, it is        necessary to place many of the statutes and agencies of state government under Part   of this chapter        on a reauthorization schedule.  Any statute or agency scheduled for termination under this chapter                is terminated unless the Legislature through affirmative act reauthorizes its existence.  The continued        existence of a statute or agency subject to this chapter may not be reauthorized for a period of more        than ten years.                 It is the purpose of this chapter to terminate any statute or agency that is not meeting a        clear public purpose, and to improve the ability of state government to meet and fulfill legitimate        public purposes.            Section  .  Section            is amended to read                       .  Guidelines for conduct of review.             Committees assigned by the Legislative Management Committee shall review each                  a   Any statute or  state  agency scheduled for termination may be reviewed by an        interim committee at the direction of              i   Legislative Management Committee              ii   the chairs of an interim committee  or             iii   an interim committee as approved by motion and majority vote of its membership.             b   The review shall begin not later than one year before scheduled termination and end        before January   of the year in which termination is scheduled.                 In determining whether to reauthorize the statute or agency, the  interim committee         agency overseeing the statute or agency scheduled for termination shall clearly identify for the        interim committee the public purpose and interest for which each statute or agency was originally        created and clearly identify whether that public purpose and interest is still relevant.                 The interim committee shall then consider                    a   the extent to which the statute or agency has operated in the public interest and any        areas in which the statute or agency needs to improve its ability to operate in the public interest                    b   the extent to which existing statutes interfere with or assist the legitimate functions        of the statute or agency, and any other circumstances including budgetary, resource, and personnel        matters that have a bearing on the capacity of the statute or agency to serve the public interest                    c   the extent to which the public has been encouraged to participate in the adoption        of the rules established in connection with the statute or agency                            d   the extent to which the statute s provisions or agency s programs and services are        duplicative of those offered by other statutes or state agencies                    e   the extent to which the objectives of the statute or agency have been accomplished        and their public benefit                    f   the adverse effect on the public of termination of the statute or agency  and                   g   any other matter relevant to the review.                 It is the responsibility of any agency scheduled for termination or any agency which has        oversight responsibilities for a statute scheduled for termination to seek its reauthorization with the        Legislature.
