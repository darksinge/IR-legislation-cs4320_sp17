This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows         AMENDS                  a    , as enacted by Chapter   and last amended by Chapters    ,     and    , Laws        of Utah             Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                  a    .  Adjudication of jurisdiction of juvenile court    Disposition of cases            Enumeration of possible court orders    Considerations of court.                 a   When a minor is found to come within the provisions of Section     a    , the        court shall so adjudicate.  The court shall make a finding of the facts upon which it bases its        jurisdiction over the minor.  However, in cases within the provisions of Subsection     a       ,        findings of fact are not necessary.             b   If the court adjudicates a minor for a crime of violence or an offense in violation of        Title   , Chapter   , Part  , Weapons, it shall order that notice of the adjudication be provided to        the school superintendent of the district in which the minor resides or attends school.  Notice shall        be made to the district superintendent within three days and shall include the specific offenses for        which the minor was adjudicated.                 Upon adjudication the court may make the following dispositions by court order              a   i   The court may place the minor on probation or under protective supervision in  his         the minor s own home and upon conditions determined by the court, including community service        as provided in Section         . .               ii   If the court orders probation, the court shall direct that notice of its order be provided to        designated persons in the local law enforcement agency and the school or transferee school, if        applicable, which the minor attends.  The designated persons may receive the information for        purposes of the minor s supervision and student safety.             iii   Any employee of the local law enforcement agency and the school which the minor        attends who discloses the court s order of probation is not              A   civilly liable except when the disclosure constitutes fraud or malice as provided in        Section          and             B   civilly or criminally liable except when the disclosure constitutes a knowing violation        of Section         .             b   The court may place the minor in the legal custody of a relative or other suitable person,        with or without probation or protective supervision, but the juvenile court may not assume the        function of developing foster home services.             c   The court may vest legal custody of the minor in the Division of Child and Family        Services, Division of Youth Corrections, or the Division of Mental Health, and may order the        Department of Human Services to provide dispositional recommendations and services.             d   The court may commit the minor to the Division of Youth Corrections for secure        confinement.  A minor under the jurisdiction of the court solely on the ground of neglect or        dependency under Subsection     a        c  may not be committed to the Division of Youth        Corrections.             e   The court may commit the minor, subject to the court retaining continuing jurisdiction        over him, to the temporary custody of the Division of Youth Corrections for observation and        evaluation for a period not to exceed    days.             f   i   The court may commit the minor to  the Division of Youth Corrections  a place of        detention or an alternative to detention for a period not to exceed    days subject to the court        retaining continuing jurisdiction over  him  the minor.   Notification of home detention, if applicable        under this subsection, shall be provided pursuant to Subsection     a       .              ii   Subsection  f  applies only to those minors adjudicated for an act which if committed                by an adult would be a criminal offense.  This commitment may be stayed or suspended upon        conditions ordered by the court.             g   The court may vest legal custody of an abused, neglected, or dependent minor in the        Division of Child and Family Services or any other appropriate person in accordance with the        requirements and procedures of Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.             h   The court may place the minor on a ranch or forestry camp, or similar facility for care        and also for work, if possible, if the person, agency, or association operating the facility has been        approved or has otherwise complied with all applicable state and local laws.  A minor placed in a        forestry camp or similar facility may be required to work on fire prevention, forestation and        reforestation, recreational works, forest roads, and on other works on or off the grounds of the        facility and may be paid wages, subject to the approval of and under conditions set by the court.             i   The court may order that the minor be required to repair, replace, or otherwise make        restitution for damage or loss caused by  his  the minor s wrongful act, including costs of treatment        as stated in Section     a    , and may impose fines in limited amounts.             j   The court may issue orders necessary for the collection of restitution and fines ordered        by the court, including garnishments, wage withholdings, and executions.             k   i   The court may through its probation department encourage the development of        employment or work programs to enable minors to fulfill their obligations under Subsection  i  and        for other purposes considered desirable by the court.             ii   Consistent with the order of the court, the probation officer may permit the minor found        to be within the jurisdiction of the court to participate in a program of work restitution or community        service in lieu of paying part or all of the fine imposed by the court.  The work restitution or        community service permitted by the probation officer may not affect the amount of the surcharge.             l   In violations of traffic laws within the court s jurisdiction, the court may, in addition to        any other disposition, restrain the minor from driving for periods of time the court considers        necessary and take possession of the minor s driver license.  However, proceedings involving an        offense under Section      a          a     are governed by that section regarding suspension of        driving privileges.                     m   i   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section            a     because of violating Section        , Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Drug Paraphernalia Act,        or Title   , Chapter   b, Imitation Controlled Substances Act, the court shall, in addition to any        fines or fees otherwise imposed, order that the minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no more        than     hours, of community service. Satisfactory completion of an approved substance abuse        prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as community service hours.             ii   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section            a     because of a violation of Section   A        or Subsection            , the court may,        upon the first adjudication, and shall, upon a second or subsequent adjudication, order that the minor        perform a minimum of    hours, but no more than     hours of community service, in addition to        any fines or fees otherwise imposed.  Satisfactory completion of an approved substance abuse        prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as community service hours.             n   The court may order that the minor be examined or treated by a physician, surgeon,        psychiatrist, or psychologist or that he receive other special care.  For these purposes the court may        place the minor in a hospital or other suitable facility.             o   i   The court may appoint a guardian for the minor if it appears necessary in the interest        of the minor, and may appoint a public or private institution or agency as guardian in which legal        custody of the minor is vested.             ii   In placing a minor under the guardianship or legal custody of an individual or of a        private agency or institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the minor.         When practicable, the court may take into consideration the religious preferences of the minor and        of  his  the minor s parents.             p   i   In support of a decree under Section     a    , the court may order reasonable        conditions to be complied with by the parents or guardian, the minor,  his  the minor s custodian,        or any other person who has been made a party to the proceedings.  Conditions may include              A   visitation by the parents or one parent              B   restrictions on the minor s associates              C   restrictions on the minor s occupation and other activities  and                     D   requirements to be observed by the parents or custodian.             ii   A minor, whose parents or guardians successfully complete a family or other counseling        program, may be credited by the court for detention, confinement, or probation time.             q   The court may order the minor to be placed in the legal custody of the Division of Mental        Health or committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority, in accordance with        the procedures and requirements of Title   A, Chapter   , Part  A.             r   The court may make an order committing a minor within its jurisdiction to the Utah State        Developmental Center if the minor has been found mentally retarded in accordance with the        provisions of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Admission to Mental Retardation Facility.  The procedure        applicable in the district courts with respect to judicial commitments to the Utah State        Developmental Center shall be followed by the juvenile court in these cases.             s   The court may terminate all parental rights upon a finding of compliance with the        provisions of Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act.             t   The court may make any other reasonable orders for the best interest of the minor or as        required for the protection of the public, except that a person younger than    years of age may not        be committed to jail or prison, and offenses under Section      a          a     are governed by        that section regarding suspension of driving privileges.             u   The court may combine several of the above listed modes of disposition if they are        compatible.             v   Before depriving any parent of custody, the court shall give due consideration to the        rights of parents concerning their minors.  The court may transfer custody to another person, agency,        or institution in accordance with the requirements and procedures of Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and        Dependency Proceedings.             w   Except as provided in Subsection     y  i , an order under this section for probation or        placement of a minor with an individual or an agency shall include a date certain for a review of the        case by the court.  A new date shall be set upon each review.             x   In reviewing foster home placements, special attention shall be given to making        adoptable minors available for adoption without delay.                     y   i   The juvenile court may enter an order of permanent custody and guardianship with        a relative or individual of a minor where the court has previously acquired jurisdiction as a result of        an adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency, excluding cases arising under Subsection            a       .             ii   Such orders remain in effect until the minor reaches majority and are not subject to        review under Section      a          a    , but may be modified by petition or motion as provided        in Section     a    .             iii   Orders permanently terminating the rights of a parent, guardian, or custodian and        permanent orders of custody and guardianship do not expire with a termination of jurisdiction of the        juvenile court.
