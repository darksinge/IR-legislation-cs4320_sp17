The division may issue, modify, or revoke any standard as follows                a   Whenever the administrator determines upon the basis of information submitted in          writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees,          a nationally recognized standards producing organization, the Department of Health and          Department of Environmental  Sciences  Quality, or a state agency or political subdivision, or on          information developed by the division or otherwise available, that a rule should be promulgated          to promote the objectives of this chapter, he may request recommendations from the advisory          council.  The administrator shall provide the advisory council with proposals, together with all          pertinent factual information developed by the division, or otherwise available, including the          results of research, demonstrations, and experiments.  The advisory council shall submit to the          administrator its recommendations regarding the rule to be promulgated within a period as          prescribed by the administrator.               b   The division shall publish a proposed rule issuing, modifying, or revoking an          occupational safety or health standard and shall afford interested parties an opportunity to submit          written data or comments as prescribed by Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking          Act.  When the administrator determines that a rule should be issued, it shall publish the proposed          rule after the submission of the advisory council s recommendations or the expiration of the period          prescribed by the administrator for submission.                       c   The administrator, in issuing standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents         under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible,         on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of         health or functional capacity even if the employee has regular exposure to the hazard during his         working life.  Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research,         demonstrations, experiments, and other information deemed appropriate.  In addition to the         attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other         considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the         standards, and experience under this and other health and safety laws.  Whenever practicable, the          standard shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.               d   i   Any employer may apply to the administrator for a temporary order granting a          variance from a standard issued under this section.  Temporary orders shall be granted only if the          employer                A   files an application which meets the requirements of Subsection     d  iv                 B   establishes that he is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because          of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed for          compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot          be completed by the effective date                C   establishes that he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against          hazards  and               D   establishes that he has an effective program for compliance as quickly as practicable.               ii   Any temporary order shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and          processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail his          program for compliance with the standard.  A temporary order may be granted only after notice          to employees and an opportunity for a public hearing  provided, that the administrator may issue          one interim order effective until a decision is made after public hearing.               iii   No temporary order may be in effect longer than the period reasonably required by          the employer to achieve compliance.  In no case shall the period of a temporary order exceed one          year.               iv   An application for a temporary order under Subsection     d  shall contain                A   a specification of the standard or part from which the employer seeks a variance                        B   a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons         having first hand knowledge of the facts represented, that he is unable to comply with the standard         or some part of the standard and a detailed statement of the reasons the employer is unable to         comply               C   a statement of the measures taken and anticipated with specific dates, to protect         employees against the hazard               D   a statement of when he expects to comply with the standard and what measures he has         taken and those anticipated, giving specific dates for compliance  and              E   a certification that he has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy          to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and          specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are          normally posted, and by other appropriate means.               v   The certification required under Subsection     d  iv  shall contain a description of          how employees have been informed.  The information to employees required under Subsection              d  v  shall inform the employees of their right to petition the department for a hearing.               vi   The administrator is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or some part of          the standard whenever he determines that it is necessary to permit an employer to participate in          a research and development project approved by the administrator to demonstrate or validate new          and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.               e   i   Any standard issued under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other          forms of warning necessary to ensure that employees are apprised of all hazards, relevant          symptoms and emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or          exposure.  Where appropriate, a standard shall prescribe suitable protective equipment and control          or technological procedures for use in connection with such hazards and provide for monitoring          or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in a manner necessary for the          protection of employees.  In addition, any such standard shall prescribe the type and frequency of          medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available by the employer, or at his cost,          to employees exposed to hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of          employees is adversely affected by exposure.  If medical examinations are in the nature of research          as determined by the division, the examinations may be furnished at division expense.  The results          of such examinations or tests shall be furnished only to the division  and, at the request of the                  employee, to his physician.              ii   The administrator may by rule make appropriate modifications in requirements for the         use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical examinations         warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments acquired         subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.              f   Whenever a rule issued by the administrator differs substantially from an existing         national consensus standard, the division shall publish a statement of the reasons why the rule as         adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.              g   Whenever a rule, standard, or national consensus standard is modified by the secretary          so as to make less restrictive the federal Williams Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of              , said less restrictive modification shall be immediately applicable to this chapter and shall          be immediately implemented by the division.                   a   The administrator shall provide an emergency temporary standard to take          immediate effect upon publication if he determines that                i   employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents          determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards  and               ii   that the standard is necessary to protect employees from danger.               b   An emergency standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard issued in          accordance with the procedures prescribed in Subsection     c .               c   Upon publication of an emergency standard the division shall commence a proceeding          in accordance with Subsection     and the standard as published shall serve as a proposed rule for          the proceedings.  The division shall issue a standard under Subsection     no later than     days          after publication of the emergency standard.                   a   Any affected employer may apply to the division for a rule or order for a variance          from a standard issued under this section.  Affected employees shall be given notice of each          application and may participate in a hearing.  The administrator shall issue such rule or order if he          determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing, that          the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the          conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be used by an          employer will provide employment and a workplace to his employees which are as safe and          healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard.                       b   The rule or order issued under Subsection     a  shall prescribe the conditions the         employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations and processes which he         must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question.              c   A rule or order issued under Subsection     a  may be modified or revoked upon         application by an employer, employees, or by the administrator on its own motion, in the manner         prescribed for its issuance under Subsection     at any time after six months from its issuance.                  Whenever the administrator issues any code, standard, rule, order, or grants any         exemption or extension of time, or compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under         this  chapter, he shall include a statement of the reasons for his action.                   Any person adversely affected by a standard issued under this section, at any time prior          to    days after a standard is issued, may file a petition challenging its validity with the district          court having jurisdiction for judicial review.  A copy of the petition shall be served upon the          division by the petitioner.  The filing of a petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court,          operate as a stay of the standard.  The determinations of the division shall be conclusive if          supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.                   In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the division          shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for          particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments.           The administrator shall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Department of Health          and Department of Environmental  Sciences  Quality about the need for mandatory standards in          determining the priority for establishing such standards.

Venue is in the district          court in the county in which the person resides.                   Any person who is dead, unconscious, or in any other condition rendering him          incapable of refusal to submit to any chemical test or tests is considered to not have withdrawn the                  consent provided for in Subsection    , and the test or tests may be administered whether the         person has been arrested or not.

For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the person          to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician, or other          person present as a condition for the taking of any test.                   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test or tests or any additional          test under this section, evidence of any refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or          proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was operating or          in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, any drug,          combination of alcohol and any drug, or while having any measurable controlled substance or          metabolite of a controlled substance in the person s body.

A child may receive services from a local mental health authority in an inpatient or          residential setting only after a commitment proceeding, for the purpose of transferring physical          custody, has been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this section.                   That commitment proceeding shall be initiated by a petition for commitment, and shall          be a careful, diagnostic inquiry, conducted by a neutral and detached fact finder, pursuant to the          procedures and requirements of this section.  If the findings described in Subsection     exist, the          proceeding shall result in the transfer of physical custody to the appropriate local mental health          authority, and the child may be placed in an inpatient or residential setting.                   The neutral and detached fact finder who conducts the inquiry                a   shall be a designated examiner, as defined in Subsection   A            and               b   may not profit, financially or otherwise, from the commitment or physical placement          of the child in that setting.                   Upon determination by the fact finder that the following circumstances clearly exist,          he may order that the child be committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority                a   the child has a mental illness, as defined in Subsection   A                          b   the child demonstrates a risk of harm to himself or others                c    the child is experiencing significant impairment in his ability to perform socially                         d   the child will benefit from care and treatment by the local mental health authority  and              e   there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative.                  a   The commitment proceeding before the neutral and detached fact finder shall be         conducted in as informal manner as possible, and in a physical setting that is not likely to have a         harmful effect on the child.              b   The child, the child s parent or legal guardian, the person who submitted the petition         for commitment, and a representative of the appropriate local mental health authority shall all         receive informal notice of the date and time of the proceeding.  Those parties shall also be afforded         an opportunity to appear and to address the petition for commitment.               c   The neutral and detached fact finder may, in his discretion, receive the testimony of          any other person.               d   The fact finder may allow the child to waive his right to be present at the commitment          proceeding, for good cause shown.  If that right is waived, the purpose of the waiver shall be made          a matter of record at the proceeding.               e   At the time of the commitment proceeding, the appropriate local mental health          authority, its designee, or the psychiatrist who has been in charge of the child s care prior to the          commitment proceeding, shall provide the neutral and detached fact finder with the following          information, as it relates to the period of current admission                i   the petition for commitment                ii   the admission notes                iii   the child s diagnosis                iv   physicians  orders                v   progress notes                vi   nursing notes  and               vii   medication records.               f   The information described in Subsection  e  shall also be provided to the child s parent          or legal guardian upon written request.               g   i   The neutral and detached fact finder s decision of commitment shall state the          duration of the commitment.  Any commitment to the physical custody of a local mental health          authority may not exceed     days.  Prior to expiration of the commitment, and if further          commitment is sought, a hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as the initial commitment                   proceeding, in accordance with the requirements of this section.              ii   When a decision for commitment is made, the neutral and detached fact finder shall         inform the child and his parent or legal guardian of that decision, and of the reasons for ordering         commitment at the conclusion of the hearing, and also in writing.              iii   The neutral and detached fact finder shall state in writing the basis of his decision,         with specific reference to each of the criteria described in Subsection    , as a matter of record.                  Absent the procedures and findings required by this section, a child may be temporarily         committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority only in accordance with the         emergency procedures described in Subsection   A           or    .  A child temporarily          committed in accordance with those emergency procedures may be held for a maximum of             hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  At the expiration of that time period, the          child shall be released unless the procedures and findings required by this section have been          satisfied.                   A local mental health authority shall have physical custody of each child committed          to it under this section.  The parent or legal guardian of a child committed to the physical custody          of a local mental health authority under this section, retains legal custody of the child, unless legal          custody has been otherwise modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In cases when the          Division of Family Services or the Division of Youth Corrections has legal custody of a child, that          division shall retain legal custody for purposes of this part.                   The cost of caring for and maintaining a child in the physical custody of a local mental          health authority shall be assessed to and paid by the child s parents, according to their ability to          pay.  For purposes of this section, the Division of Family Services or the Division of Youth          Corrections shall be financially responsible, in addition to the child s parents, if the child is in the          legal custody of either of those divisions at the time the child is committed to the physical custody          of a local mental health authority under this section, unless Medicaid regulation or contract          provisions specify otherwise.  The Office of Recovery Services shall assist those divisions in          collecting the costs assessed pursuant to this section.                   Whenever application is made for commitment of a minor to a local mental health          authority under any provision of this section by a person other than the child s parent or guardian,          the local mental health authority or its designee shall notify the child s parent or guardian.  The          parents shall be provided sufficient time to prepare and appear at any scheduled proceeding.                             a   Each child committed pursuant to this section is entitled to an appeal within            days after any order for commitment.  The appeal may be brought on the child s own petition, or         that of his parent or legal guardian, to the juvenile court in the district where the child resides or         is currently physically located.  With regard to a child in the custody of the Division of Family         Services or the Division of Youth Corrections, the attorney general s office shall handle the appeal,         otherwise the appropriate county attorney s office is responsible for appeals brought pursuant to         this subsection.              b   Upon receipt of the petition for appeal, the court shall appoint a designated examiner         previously unrelated to the case, to conduct an examination of the child in accordance with the          criteria described in Subsection    , and file a written report with the court.  The court shall then          conduct an appeal hearing to determine whether the findings described in Subsection     exist by          clear and convincing evidence.               c   Prior to the time of the appeal hearing, the appropriate local mental health authority,          its designee, or the mental health professional who has been in charge of the child s care prior to          commitment, shall provide the court and the designated examiner for the appeal hearing with the          following information, as it relates to the period of current admission                i   the original petition for commitment                ii   admission notes                iii   diagnosis                iv   physicians  orders                v   progress notes                vi   nursing notes  and               vii   medication records.               d   Both the neutral and detached fact finder and the designated examiner appointed for          the appeal hearing shall be provided with an opportunity to review the most current information          described in Subsection  c  prior to the appeal hearing.               e   The child, his parent or legal guardian, the person who submitted the original petition          for commitment, and a representative of the appropriate local mental health authority shall be          notified by the court of the date and time of the appeal hearing.  Those persons shall be afforded          an opportunity to appear at the hearing.  In reaching its decision, the court shall review the record          and findings of the neutral and detached fact finder, the report of the designated examiner                   appointed pursuant to Subsection  b , and may, in its discretion, allow or require the testimony of         the neutral and detached fact finder, the designated examiner, the child, the child s parent or legal         guardian, the person who brought the initial petition for commitment, or any other person whose         testimony the court deems relevant.  The court may allow the child to waive his right to appear at         the appeal hearing, for good cause shown.  If that waiver is granted, the purpose shall be made a         part of the court s record.                   Each local mental health authority has an affirmative duty to conduct periodic         evaluations of the mental health and treatment progress of every child committed to its physical         custody under this section, and to release any child who has sufficiently improved so that the          criteria justifying commitment no longer exist.                    a   A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s          current treating mental health professional may release an improved child to a less restrictive          environment, as they determine appropriate.  Whenever the local mental health authority or its          designee, and the child s current treating mental health professional, determine that the conditions          justifying commitment no longer exist, the child shall be discharged and released to his parent or          legal guardian.  With regard to a child who is in the physical custody of the State Hospital, the          treating psychiatrist or clinical director of the State Hospital shall be the child s current treating          mental health professional.               b   A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s current          treating mental health professional, is authorized to issue a written order for the immediate          placement of a child not previously released from an order of commitment into a more restrictive          environment, if the local authority or its designee and the child s current treating mental health          professional has reason to believe that the less restrictive environment in which the child has been          placed is exacerbating his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others.               c   The written order described in Subsection  b  shall include the reasons for placement          in a more restrictive environment and shall authorize any peace officer to take the child into          physical custody and transport him to a facility designated by the appropriate local mental health          authority in conjunction with the child s current treating mental health professional.  Prior to          admission to the more restrictive environment, copies of the order shall be personally delivered          to the child, his parent or legal guardian, the administrator of the more restrictive environment, or          his designee, and the child s former treatment provider or facility.                        d   If the child has been in a less restrictive environment for more than    days and is         aggrieved by the change to a more restrictive environment, the child or his representative may         request a review within    days of the change, by a neutral and detached fact finder as described         in Subsection    .  The fact finder shall determine whether               i   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is exacerbating his         mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others  or              ii   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is not exacerbating         his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others, in which case the fact finder         shall designate that the child remain in the less restrictive environment.               e   Nothing in this section prevents a local mental health authority or its designee, in          conjunction with the child s current mental health professional, from discharging a child from          commitment or from placing a child in an environment that is less restrictive than that designated          by the neutral and detached fact finder.                    Each local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s          current treating mental health professional shall discharge any child who, in the opinion of that          local authority, or its designee, and the child s current treating mental health professional, no          longer meets the criteria specified in Subsection    , except as provided by Section      a                  a    .  The local authority and the mental health professional shall assure that any further          supportive services required to meet the child s needs upon release will be provided.                    Even though a child has been committed to the physical custody of a local mental          health authority pursuant to this section, the child is still entitled to additional due process          proceedings, in accordance with Section   A       . , before any treatment which may affect a          constitutionally protected liberty or privacy interest is administered.  Those treatments include, but          are not limited to, antipsychotic medication, electroshock therapy, and psychosurgery.              Section    .  Section    A        is amended to read                  A       .  Responsibilities of the Division of Mental Health.                   It is the responsibility of the division to assure that the requirements of this part are met          and applied uniformly by local mental health authorities across the state.                   Since it is the division s responsibility, under Section   A       , to contract with,          review, and approve local mental health authority plans, and to withhold funds from local mental          health authorities and public and private providers for contract noncompliance, the division shall                         a   require each local mental health authority to submit its plan to the division by May           of each year               b   forward a copy of each local mental health authority s written plan to the Office of         Legislative Research and General Counsel, for review by the Human Services Interim Committee,         within ten days after receiving the plan               c   conduct an annual program audit and review of each local mental health authority in         the state, and its contract provider  and              d   provide a written  and oral  report to the Human Services Interim Committee on July          ,     , and each year thereafter, and provide an oral report to that committee, as scheduled.  That          report shall provide information regarding the annual program audit, the financial status of each          local mental health authority and its contract provider, the status of each local authority s and its          contract provider s compliance with its plan, state statutes, and with the provisions of the contract          awarded.

The Legislature of the state of Utah having heretofore declared by Section       , Utah         Code Annotated     , that,  All waters of this state, whether above or under the ground are hereby         declared to be the property of the public, subject to all existing rights to the use thereof   and          further, by Section       , Utah Code Annotated     , that  Beneficial use shall be the basis, the          measures and the limit of all rights to the use of water in this state   and further, by Section                 , Utah Code Annotated     ,    A        that the policy of the state is,  To obtain from          water in Utah the highest duty for domestic uses and irrigation of lands in Utah within the terms          of interstate compacts or otherwise,  now by this act reiterates and reaffirms such declaration of          the public policy of the state of Utah.                   It is further declared to be the policy of this  act  chapter and of the state of Utah, and          the legislature recognizes                      a   That by construction of projects based upon sound engineering the waters within          the various counties of the state of Utah can be saved from waste and increased in efficiency of          beneficial use by    per cent to     per cent                      b   That because of well known conditions such as low prices and lack of market for          farm products, particularly the inefficiency of water supply because of lack of late season water          and consequent lack of financial strength, water users in small communities have been unable to          build projects that would provide full conservation and beneficial use for the limited water supply          in this semiarid land                      c   That water, as the property of the public, should be so managed by the public that          it can be put to the highest use for public benefit                      d   That Congress of the United States has provided for the building of larger water          conservation projects throughout the semiarid states, payment of the capital costs without interest          to be made by the water users upon the basis of a fair portion of crop returns                      e   That the Congress of the United States has established in the department of                   interior and in the department of agriculture, various agencies having authority to develop, protect,         and aid in putting to beneficial use the land and water resources of the United States and to         cooperate with state agencies having similar authority                     f   That the interests of the state of Utah require that means be provided for close         cooperation between all state and federal agencies to the end that the underground waters and         waters of the small streams of the state, and the lands thereunder, can be made to yield abundantly         and increase the income and well being of the citizens of the state                     g   That it appears to be sound public policy for the state of Utah to provide a         revolving fund, to be increased at each legislative session, to the end that every mountain stream          and every water resource within the state can be made to render the highest beneficial service, such          fund to be so administered that no project will be built except upon expert engineering, financial,          and geological approval.
