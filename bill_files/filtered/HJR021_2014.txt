JOINT RESOLUTION ON THE SOVEREIGN CHARACTER                           OF PILT  PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES                                  GENERAL SESSION                          STATE OF UTAH                             Chief Sponsor   Ken Ivory                                Senate Sponsor             David P. Hinkins                                                         LONG TITLE                          General Description                                This joint resolution of the Legislature strongly urges the United States Congress to                           fully and permanently fund Payment In Lieu of Taxes  PILT  and transfer to the state of                           Utah the federally controlled public lands within the state.                           Highlighted Provisions                                This resolution                                .    urges and directs the United States Congress to use every exertion in its power, by                           reason, argument, and persuasion, to induce the United States to fully fund, on a                           perpetual and mandatory basis, Payments In Lieu of Taxes  PILT , which the state                           and its subdivisions would otherwise collect if the federal government honored the                           same statehood enabling act terms that it honored with all states east of Colorado                            and                               .    demands, if Congress cannot or will not fully fund PILT at the full assessed value of                           similarly situated lands within Utah s counties on a mandatory, permanent, and                           perpetual basis, that Congress transfer title to the public lands, as was done                           previously for similarly impacted states east of Colorado, directly to the state of                           Utah so that Utah and its subdivisions can generate tax and other revenues from                           these lands to fund education, police, fire, sanitation, social welfare, and other                           essential public services.                              Special Clauses                                None                                                    Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                WHEREAS, the United States Congress elected to not fund the Payment In Lieu of                           Taxes  PILT  Act in its most recent   .  trillion Omnibus Spending Bill of                                     WHEREAS, Congress instead included funding for its PILT obligations for only one                           year in the Farm Bill of                                     WHEREAS, PILT was imposed by Congress in      to compensate states for the loss                           of tax and other revenues that states would generate if Congress had honored its nearly                               year old      obligation to transfer title to the public lands                                WHEREAS, Congress originally promised that PILT would be mandatory and                           perpetual because it was intentionally imposed as a substitute for what the congressional                           Committee on the Public Lands referred to in      as  a power incident to all sovereign states                           of taxing the soil to confer benefits                                 WHEREAS, in     , Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy Management Act of                               , or FLPMA, which unilaterally changed the obligation of the federal government to                           transfer title to the public lands in favor of a policy to  forever retain public lands in federal                           ownership                                 WHEREAS, as a palliative to the affected states for usurping this  power incident to all                           sovereign states of taxing the soil  through FLPMA, Congress also imposed the new PILT                           program                                WHEREAS, as a result of the federal government s failure or refusal to transfer title to                           the public lands, some counties in Utah have as little as    taxable lands to fund education,                           police, fire, sanitation, social welfare, and other essential public services                                WHEREAS, an analysis by the Legislature s Office of Legislative Fiscal Analyst                           reveals that the amounts previously funded by Congress as PILT to Utah counties amounts only                           to approximately    cents on the dollar of the average taxable value for similarly situated                           lands                                WHEREAS, PILT more accurately represents  Pennies In Lieu of Trillions,  in light of                           the fact that the Institute for Energy Research estimated in      that there is more than                                   trillion in mineral value locked up in federally controlled lands                                WHEREAS, the United States Government Accountability Office estimated in                                that there is more recoverable oil in the federally controlled lands in Utah, Colorado, and                           Wyoming than the rest of the world combined                                WHEREAS, as a result of having such a minimal amount of lands subject to taxation or                           other revenues because of federal retention of these lands, Utah counties are dependent upon                           the promise of PILT for as much as     of their total county budgets to fund education, police,                           fire, sanitation, social services, and other essential public services                                WHEREAS, a one year appropriation for PILT in the Farm Bill of      disregards                           entirely the uniquely sovereign character of PILT  putting PILT on par with other line items of                           federal expense like funding the study of excess alcohol on prostitutes in China  rather than                           honoring PILT as a mandatory and perpetual substitute for the  power incident to all sovereign                           states of taxing the soil                                 WHEREAS, a mere one year PILT appropriation denies state and local governments of                           budgetary certainty to meet fundamental public obligations like funding education, police, fire,                           sanitation, social welfare, and other essential public services                                WHEREAS, the federal government has not passed a budget for more than five years,                           has accumulated a national debt exceeding     trillion, overspends at the rate of nearly                              trillion a year, has unfunded obligations for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and others in                           excess of     trillion, and is creating money at the rate of tens of billions of dollars per month                                WHEREAS, the United States Government Accountability Office regularly declares                           that the financial statement of the United States is  unsustainable                                 WHEREAS, history reflects that Congress previously delayed for decades disposing of                           as much as     of the lands in states such as Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana,                           Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, depriving these states of the ability to tax or generate                           revenues from their lands                                WHEREAS, lacking the ability to tax or generate revenues from their lands, the                                congressional Committee on the Public Lands indicated  in vain may the People of these States                           expect the advantages of well settled neighborhoods, so essential to the education of youth . . .                           Those states will, for many generations, without some change, be retarded in endeavors to                           increase their comfort and wealth, by means of works of internal improvements, because they                              have not the power, incident to all sovereign States, of taxing the soil, to pay for the benefits                           conferred upon its owner                                 WHEREAS, upon raising their collective demand to Congress, the congressional                           Committee on the Public Lands found with respect to their admission as states that  when these                           States stipulated not to tax the lands of the United States until they were sold, they rested upon                           the implied engagement of Congress to cause them to be sold, within a reasonable time.  No                           just equivalent has been given those States for a surrender of an attribute of sovereignty so                           important to their welfare, and to an equal standing with the original States                                 WHEREAS, ultimately, the collective and persistent demands of these states resulted in                           the transfer of their public lands by Congress                                 WHEREAS, Congress s obligation to transfer title to the public lands to the states is                            included in the Enabling Act for Utah s admission as a state  an agreement the United States                            Supreme Court refers to as a  bi lateral  and  solemn compact                                  WHEREAS, the terms of Utah s Enabling Act, with respect to the transfer of public                            lands, are in all material respects similar to the enabling acts of most of the newly created states                            east of Colorado and west of the original    states  and                                WHEREAS, legal analysis by the Federalist Society concludes that the Enabling Act is                             a compact and promise made between two sovereigns where the federal government                            committed itself to disposal and promised that it would exercise its disposal obligations in a                            manner  and with an understanding that respects the expectation by the State that the federal                            government would dispose of such lands  so that both a percentage of the proceeds from the                            sales would be shared with the State and the State thereafter would have the capacity to tax                            such lands when disposed . . .                                  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that until the federal government honors the                            promise made at statehood to transfer title to the public lands, the Legislature of the state of                            Utah urges and directs, in the most strenuous terms within the power of a sovereign and                            independent state, that the senators and representatives of the United States Congress use every                            exertion in their power, by reason, argument, and persuasion, to induce the United States to                            fully fund, on a perpetual and mandatory basis, Payments In Lieu of Taxes  PILT , which the                            state and its subdivisions would otherwise collect if the federal government honored the same                            statehood enabling act terms that it honored with all states east of Colorado.                                   BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that if Congress cannot or will not fully fund PILT at                            the full assessed value of similarly situated lands within Utah s counties on a mandatory,                            permanent, and perpetual basis, the Legislature of the state of Utah demands that Congress                            transfer title to the public lands, as was done previously for similarly impacted states east of                            Colorado, directly to the state of Utah so that Utah and its subdivisions can generate tax and                            other revenues from these lands to fund education, police, fire, sanitation, social welfare, and                            other essential public services.                                BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Majority                            Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives,                            the United States Department of the Interior, and the members of Utah s congressional                            delegation.
