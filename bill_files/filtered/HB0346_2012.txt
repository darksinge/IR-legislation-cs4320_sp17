Section                is amended to read                                        .  Order for hearing    Stay of other proceedings    Examinations of                           defendant    Scope of examination and report.                                    a   When a petition is filed pursuant to Section                 raising the issue of the                           defendant s competency to stand trial or when the court raises the issue of the defendant s                           competency pursuant to Section                , the court in which proceedings are pending shall stay                           all proceedings.  If the proceedings are in a court other than the district court in which the                           petition is filed, the district court shall notify that court of the filing of the petition.                                b   The district court in which the petition is filed shall pass upon the sufficiency of the                           allegations of incompetency.  If a petition is opposed by either party, the court shall, prior to                           granting or denying the petition, hold a limited hearing solely for the purpose of determining                           the sufficiency of the petition.  If the court finds that the allegations of incompetency raise a                           bona fide doubt as to the defendant s competency to stand trial, it shall enter an order for a                           hearing on the mental condition of the person who is the subject of the petition.                                    a   After the granting of a petition and prior to a full competency hearing, the court                           may order the Department of Human Services to examine the person and to report to the court                           concerning the defendant s mental condition.                                b   The defendant shall be examined by at least two mental health experts not involved                           in the current treatment of the defendant.                                c   If the issue is sufficiently raised in the petition or if it becomes apparent that the                           defendant may be incompetent due to mental retardation, at least one expert experienced in                           mental retardation assessment shall evaluate the defendant.  Upon appointment of the experts,                           the petitioner or other party as directed by the court shall provide information and materials to                           the examiners relevant to a determination of the defendant s competency and shall provide                           copies of the charging document, arrest or incident reports pertaining to the charged offense,                           known criminal history information, and known prior mental health evaluations and treatments.                                d   The prosecuting and defense attorneys shall cooperate in providing the relevant                           information and materials to the examiners, and the court may make the necessary orders to                              provide the information listed in Subsection     c  to the examiners.  The court may provide in                           its order for a competency examination of a defendant that custodians of mental health records                           pertaining to the defendant shall provide those records to the examiners without the need for                           consent of the defendant or further order of the court.                                    During the examination under Subsection    , unless the court or the executive                           director of the department directs otherwise, the defendant shall be retained in the same                           custody or status he was in at the time the examination was ordered.                                    The experts shall in the conduct of their examination and in their report to the court                           consider and address, in addition to any other factors determined to be relevant by the experts                                 a   the defendant s present capacity to                                 i   comprehend and appreciate the charges or allegations against him                                 ii   disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind                                 iii   comprehend and appreciate the range and nature of possible penalties, if                           applicable, that may be imposed in the proceedings against him                                 iv   engage in reasoned choice of legal strategies and options                                 v   understand the adversary nature of the proceedings against him                                 vi   manifest appropriate courtroom behavior  and                                vii   testify relevantly, if applicable                                 b   the impact of the mental disorder, or mental retardation, if any, on the nature and                           quality of the defendant s relationship with counsel                                 c   if psychoactive medication is currently being administered                                 i   whether the medication is necessary to maintain the defendant s competency  and                                ii   the effect of the medication, if any, on the defendant s demeanor and affect and                           ability to participate in the proceedings.                                    If the expert s opinion is that the defendant is incompetent to proceed, the expert                           shall indicate in the report                                 a   which of the above factors contributes to the defendant s incompetency                                 b   the nature of the defendant s mental disorder or mental retardation and its                           relationship to the factors contributing to the defendant s incompetency                                 c   the treatment or treatments appropriate and available  and                                d   the defendant s capacity to give informed consent to treatment to restore                              competency.                                    The experts examining the defendant shall provide an initial report to the court and                           the prosecuting and defense attorneys within    days of the receipt of the court s order.  The                           report shall inform the court of the examiner s opinion concerning the competency of the                           defendant to stand trial, or, in the alternative, the examiner may inform the court in writing that                           additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the examiner informs the court that                           additional time is needed, the examiner shall have up to an additional    days to provide the                           report to the court and counsel.  The examiner must provide the report within    days from the                           receipt of the court s order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional                           period of time to complete the examination and provide the report.                                     Any written report submitted by the experts shall                                  a   identify the specific matters referred for evaluation                                  b   describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination and the                            purpose or purposes for each                                  c   state the expert s clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue referred                            for examination by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the expert                            could not give an opinion  and                                 d   identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the basis for the                            expert s clinical findings and opinions.                                     a   Any statement made by the defendant in the course of any competency                            examination, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, any                            testimony by the expert based upon such statement, and any other fruits of the statement may                            not be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an                            issue respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.  The                            evidence may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the defendant s                            competency.                                 b   Prior to examining the defendant, examiners should specifically advise the                            defendant of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection     a .                                     When the report is received the court shall set a date for a mental hearing which                            shall be held in not less than five and not more than    days, unless the court enlarges the time                            for good cause.  Any person or organization directed by the department to conduct the                               examination may be subpoenaed to testify at the hearing.  If the experts are in conflict as to the                            competency of the defendant, all experts should be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably                            available.  The court may call any examiner to testify at the hearing who is not called by the                            parties.  If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross examine the expert.                                      A person shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of the                            evidence, finds the person incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the proponent                            of incompetency at the hearing.  An adjudication of incompetency to proceed shall not operate                            as an adjudication of incompetency to give informed consent for medical treatment or for any                            other purpose, unless specifically set forth in the court order.                                      a   The court, in determining the defendant s competency to stand trial, shall                           consider the totality of the circumstances, which includes the information presented under                           Subsection      b  in addition to the expert testimony, studies, and reports provided under this                           section.                                 b   The information to be considered by the court shall include all available and                           relevant evidence, witnesses, and testimony to ensure that there is no manipulation of the                           process or a wrongful or artificial attempt or motivation on the part of the defendant to avoid                           being found competent to stand trial.                                 c   All witnesses and evidence regarding the defendant s personal contact with                           individuals which may relate to the competency of the defendant to stand trial shall be                           considered by the court and applied to its determination of the defendant s competency under                           this section.                                             a   If the court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, its order shall                            contain findings addressing each of the factors in Subsections     a  and  b  of this section.                             The order issued pursuant to Subsection                    which the court sends to the facility where                            the defendant is committed or to the person who is responsible for assessing his progress                            toward competency shall be provided contemporaneously with the transportation and                            commitment order of the defendant, unless exigent circumstances require earlier commitment                            in which case the court shall forward the order within five working days of the order of                            transportation and commitment of the defendant.                                 b   The order finding the defendant incompetent to stand trial shall be accompanied by                                  i   copies of the reports of the experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of                               examination if not provided previously                                  ii   copies of any of the psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports submitted to                            the court relative to the mental condition of the defendant  and                                 iii   any other documents made available to the court by either the defense or the                            prosecution, pertaining to the defendant s current or past mental condition.                                             a   If the court finds it necessary to order the defendant transported prior to                            the completion of findings and compilation of documents required under Subsection                                      , the transportation and commitment order delivering the defendant to the Utah State                            Hospital, or other mental health facility as directed by the executive director of the Department                            of Human Services or his designee, shall indicate that the defendant s commitment is based                            upon a finding of incompetency, and the mental health facility s copy of the order shall be                            accompanied by the reports of any experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of                            examination.                                 b   The executive director of the Department of Human Services or his designee may                            refuse to accept a defendant as a patient unless he is accompanied by a transportation and                            commitment order which is accompanied by the reports.                                             Upon a finding of incompetency to stand trial by the court, the prosecuting                            and defense attorneys shall provide information and materials relevant to the defendant s                            competency to the facility where the defendant is committed or to the person responsible for                            assessing his progress towards competency.  In addition to any other materials, the prosecuting                            attorney shall provide                                  a   copies of the charging document and supporting affidavits or other documents used                            in the determination of probable cause                                  b   arrest or incident reports prepared by a law enforcement agency pertaining to the                            charged offense  and                                 c   information concerning the defendant s known criminal history.                                             The court may make any reasonable order to insure compliance with this                            section.

Except as provided in Subsection    , if after hearing ,  the person is found to be                            incompetent to stand trial, the court shall order the defendant committed to the custody of the                            executive director of the Department of Human Services or his designee for the purpose of                            treatment intended to restore the defendant to competency.  The court may recommend but not                            order placement of the defendant.  The court may, however, order that the defendant be placed                            in a secure setting rather than a nonsecure setting.  The director or his designee shall designate                            the specific placement of the defendant during the period of evaluation and treatment to restore                            competency.                                     The examiner or examiners designated by the executive director to assess the                            defendant s progress toward competency may not be involved in the routine treatment of the                            defendant.  The examiner or examiners shall provide a full report to the court and prosecuting                            and defense attorneys within    days of arrival of the defendant at the treating facility.  If any                            examiner is unable to complete the assessment within    days, that examiner shall provide to                            the court and counsel a summary progress report which informs the court that additional time is                            necessary to complete the assessment, in which case the examiner shall have up to an                            additional    days to provide the full report.  The full report shall assess                                  a   the facility s or program s capacity to provide appropriate treatment for the                            defendant                                  b   the nature of treatments provided to the defendant                                  c   what progress toward competency restoration has been made with respect to the                            factors identified by the court in its initial order                                  d   the defendant s current level of mental disorder or mental retardation and need for                            treatment, if any  and                                 e   the likelihood of restoration of competency and the amount of time estimated to                            achieve it.                                     The court on its own motion or upon motion by either party or by the executive                            director may appoint additional mental health examiners to examine the defendant and advise                            the court on his current mental status and progress toward competency restoration.                                     Upon receipt of the full report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the                               defendant s current status.  At the hearing, the burden of proving that the defendant is                            competent is on the proponent of competency.  Following the hearing, the court shall determine                            by a preponderance of evidence whether the defendant is                                  a   competent to stand trial                                  b   incompetent to stand trial with a substantial probability that the defendant may                            become competent in the foreseeable future  or                                 c   incompetent to stand trial without a substantial probability that the defendant may                            become competent in the foreseeable future.                                     a   If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection     a , the court shall                            proceed with the trial or such other procedures as may be necessary to adjudicate the charges.                                 b   If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection     b , the court may order that                            the defendant remain committed to the custody of the executive director of the Department of                            Human Services or his designee for the purpose of treatment intended to restore the defendant                            to competency.                                 c   If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection     c , the court shall order  the                           defendant released from the custody of the director unless the prosecutor informs the court                             that commitment proceedings pursuant to Title   A, Chapter  , Services  to  for People with                            Disabilities, or Title   A, Chapter   , Substance Abuse and Mental Health Act, will be                            initiated.  These commitment proceedings must be initiated within seven days after the court s                            order entering the finding in Subsection     c , unless the court enlarges the time for good                            cause shown.  The defendant may be ordered to remain in the custody of the director until                            commitment proceedings have been concluded.  If the defendant is committed, the court which                            entered the order pursuant to Subsection     c , shall be notified by the director at least    days                            prior to any release of the committed person.                                     If the defendant is recommitted to the department pursuant to Subsection     b , the                            court shall hold a hearing one year following the recommitment.                                     At the hearing held pursuant to Subsection    , except for defendants charged with                            the crimes listed in Subsection    , a defendant who has not been restored to competency shall                            be  ordered released or  temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under the                            same terms as provided in Subsection     c .                                     If the defendant has been charged with aggravated murder, murder, attempted                               murder, manslaughter, or a first degree felony and the court determines that the defendant is                            making reasonable progress towards restoration of competency at the time of the hearing held                            pursuant to Subsection    , the court may order the defendant recommitted for a period not to                            exceed    months for the purpose of treatment to restore the defendant to competency with a                            mandatory review hearing at the end of the    month period.                                     Except for defendants charged with aggravated murder or murder, a defendant who                            has not been restored to competency at the time of the hearing held pursuant to Subsection                                shall be  ordered released or  temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings                            under the same terms as provided in Subsection     c .                                      If the defendant has been charged with aggravated murder or murder and the court                            determines that he is making reasonable progress towards restoration of competency at the time                            of the mandatory review hearing held pursuant to Subsection    , the court may order the                            defendant recommitted for a period not to exceed    months for the purpose of treatment to                            restore him to competency.                                      If the defendant is recommitted to the department pursuant to Subsection     , the                            court shall hold a hearing no later than at    month intervals following the recommitment for                            the purpose of determining the defendant s competency status.                                      A defendant who has not been restored to competency at the expiration of the                            additional    month commitment period ordered pursuant to Subsection      shall be  ordered                           released or  temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under the same terms                            as provided in Subsection     c .                                      In no event may the maximum period of detention under this section exceed the                            maximum period of incarceration which the defendant could receive if he were convicted of                            the charged offense.  This Subsection      does not preclude pursuing involuntary civil                            commitment nor does it place any time limit on civil commitments.                                      Neither release from a pretrial incompetency commitment under the provisions of                            this section nor civil commitment requires dismissal of criminal charges.  The court may retain                            jurisdiction over the criminal case and may order periodic reviews to assess the defendant s                            competency to stand trial.                                      A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to Title   A, Chapter  , Services                             to  for People with Disabilities, or Title   A, Chapter   , Substance Abuse and Mental Health                               Act, may still be adjudicated competent to stand trial under this chapter.                                      a   The remedy for a violation of the time periods specified in this section, other                            than those specified in Subsection     c ,    ,    ,     , or     , shall be a motion to compel the                            hearing, or mandamus, but not release from detention or dismissal of the criminal charges.                                 b   The remedy for a violation of the time periods specified in Subsection     c ,    ,                               ,     , or      shall not be dismissal of the criminal charges.                                      In cases in which the treatment of the defendant is precluded by court order for a                            period of time, that time period may not be considered in computing time limitations under this                            section.                                      At any time that the defendant becomes competent to stand trial, the clinical                            director of the hospital or other facility or the executive director of the Department of Human                            Services shall certify that fact to the court.  The court shall conduct a hearing within                               working days of the receipt of the clinical director s or executive director s report, unless the                            court enlarges the time for good cause.                                      The court may order a hearing or rehearing at any time on its own motion or upon                            recommendations of the clinical director of the hospital or other facility or the executive                            director of the Department of Human Services.                                      Notice of a hearing on competency to stand trial shall be given to the prosecuting                            attorney.  If the hearing is held in the county where the defendant is confined, notice shall also                            be given to the prosecuting attorney for that county.

In the notice under Subsection     a , the executive director shall state whether the                            executive director believes                                  a   medication is necessary to render the defendant competent                                  b   medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent                                  c   medication is substantially unlikely to produce side effects which would                            significantly interfere with the defendant s ability to assist in his defense                                  d   no less intrusive means are available, and whether any of those means have been                            attempted to render the defendant competent  and                                 e   medication is medically appropriate and is in the defendant s best medical interest                            in light of his medical condition.                                     a   Upon receipt of the notice under Subsection     a , the court shall conduct a                            hearing within    days, unless the court extends the time for good cause, to determine whether                            the court should convene a hearing regarding the involuntary medication of the defendant.                                 b   The prosecuting attorney shall represent the state at any hearing under this section.                                 c   The court shall consider whether the following factors apply in determining                            whether the defendant should be involuntarily medicated                                  i   important state interests are at stake in restoring the defendant s competency                                  ii   involuntary medication will significantly further the important state interests, in                            that the medication proposed                                  A   is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial  and                                 B   is substantially unlikely to produce side effects which would significantly interfere                            with the defendant s ability to assist the defense counsel in conducting his defense                                  iii   involuntary medication is necessary to further important state interests, because                            any alternate less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results  and                                 iv   the administration of the proposed medication is medically appropriate, as it is in                            the defendant s best medical interest in light of his medical condition.                                        In determining whether the proposed treatment is medically appropriate and is in                            the defendant s best medical interest, the potential penalty the defendant may be subject to, if                            the defendant is convicted of any charged offense, is not a relevant consideration.                                     a   If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the involuntary                            administration of antipsychotic medication is appropriate, it shall make findings addressing                            each of the factors in Subsection     c  and shall issue an order authorizing the Department of                            Human Services to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication to the defendant in order                            to restore his competency, subject to the periodic reviews and other procedures provided in                            Section                .                                 b   When issuing an order under Subsection     a , the court shall consider ordering                            less intrusive means for administering the drugs, such as a court order to the defendant                            enforceable by the contempt power, before ordering more intrusive methods of involuntary                            medication.                                     The provisions in Section                 establishing time limitations for treatment of                            incompetent defendants before they must  be either released or civilly committed  undergo                           civil commitment proceedings are tolled from the time the executive director gives notice to                            the court and the parties under Subsection     until                                  a   the court has issued a final order for the involuntary medication of the defendant,                            and the defendant has been medicated under that order  or                                 b   the court has issued a final order that the defendant will not be involuntarily                            medicated.                                     This section applies only when the prosecution seeks an order of involuntary                            medication solely for the purpose of rendering a defendant competent to proceed.
