         STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE OF SUMMONS           GENERAL SESSION      STATE OF UTAH      Chief Sponsor   LaVar Christensen      Senate Sponsor                            LONG TITLE      General Description            This bill requires that a summons be issued before an arrest warrant under certain       circumstances.       Highlighted Provisions             This bill                   requires that a summons or citation be issued for a person accused of committing a       crime  and                  requires that the magistrate issue a summons if the magistrate finds that the accused       is likely to appear and is not                        a danger to the community                        a flight risk  or                       a danger to other persons or property.

A magistrate may issue a citation and summons to appear or, for heightened cause       as provided in this section, a warrant for arrest upon finding probable cause to believe that the       person to be summoned or arrested has committed a public offense.                 If the magistrate determines that there is probable cause to believe that a public       offense has been committed, the magistrate shall issue a citation and summons to the accused.        A warrant for arrest may not be issued instead of a citation and summons unless the magistrate       determines there is a substantial risk of a breach of the peace, injury to persons or property,       flight to avoid prosecution, or danger to the community.  The citation and summons shall       include the same information required under Subsection           .                 All defendants charged with public offenses of any type are presumed innocent       under the United States Constitution unless and until proven guilty and at all times are entitled       to full due process of law.  Therefore, a citation and summons rather than an arrest warrant is       the preferred and required means of initiating a prosecution and giving notice to the accused       unless the heightened standard applies under Subsection    .  Administrative convenience or       preference by the courts or the prosecution are not valid grounds for issuance of a warrant and       arrest rather than a citation and summons.                 If the offense charged is              a   a felony, the arrest upon a warrant may be made at any time of the day or night  or             b   a misdemeanor, the arrest upon a warrant can be made at night only if              i   the magistrate has endorsed authorization to do so on the warrant              ii   the person to be arrested is upon a public highway, in a public place, or in a place       open to or accessible to the public  or             iii   the person to be arrested is encountered by a peace officer in the regular course of       that peace officer s investigation of a criminal offense unrelated to the misdemeanor warrant for       arrest.                       For the purpose of Subsection                        a   daytime hours are the hours of   a.m. to    p.m.  and             b   nighttime hours are the hours after    p.m. and before   a.m.                       a   If the magistrate determines that the accused must appear in court, the       magistrate shall include in the arrest warrant the name of the law enforcement agency in the       county or municipality with jurisdiction over the offense charged.             b   i   The law enforcement agency identified by the magistrate under Subsection                 a  is responsible for providing inter county transportation of the defendant, if necessary,       from the arresting law enforcement agency to the court site.             ii   The law enforcement agency named on the warrant may contract with another law       enforcement agency to have a defendant transported.             c   i   The law enforcement agency identified by the magistrate under Subsection                 a  as responsible for transporting the defendant shall provide, to the court clerk of the court       in which the defendant is tried, an affidavit stating that the defendant was transported,       indicating the law enforcement agency responsible for the transportation, and stating the       number of miles the defendant was transported.             ii   The court clerk shall account for restitution paid under Subsection             for       governmental transportation expenses and dispense restitution money collected by the court to       the law enforcement agency responsible for the transportation of a convicted defendant.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
