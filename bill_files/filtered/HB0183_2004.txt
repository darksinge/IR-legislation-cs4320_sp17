Upon arrest for domestic violence, a person may not be released on bail,                           recognizance, or otherwise prior to the close of the next court day following the arrest, unless                           as a condition of that release he is ordered by the court or agrees in writing that until the                           expiration of that time he will                                 a   have no personal contact with the alleged victim                                 b   not threaten or harass the alleged victim  and                                c   not knowingly enter onto the premises of the alleged victim s residence or any                           premises temporarily occupied by the alleged victim.                                    As a condition of release, the court may order the defendant to participate in an                           electronic monitoring program and pay the costs associated with the program.                                    a   Subsequent to an arrest for domestic violence, an alleged victim may waive in                           writing any or all of the requirements described in Subsection    .  Upon waiver, those                           requirements shall not apply to the alleged perpetrator.                                b   A court or magistrate may modify the requirements described in Subsections     a                            or  c , in writing or on the record, and only for good cause shown.                                    a   Whenever a person is released pursuant to Subsection    , the releasing agency                           shall  notify the arresting law enforcement agency of the release, conditions of release, and any                           available information concerning the location of the victim.  The arresting law enforcement                           agency shall then make reasonable effort to notify the victim of that release.                                b   i   When a person is released pursuant to Subsection     based on a written                           agreement, the releasing agency shall transmit that information to the statewide domestic                           violence network described in Section               .                                ii   When a person is released pursuant to Subsection     based upon a court order, the                           court shall transmit that order to the statewide domestic violence network described in Section                                      .                                c   This Subsection     does not create or increase liability of a law enforcement officer                           or agency, and the good faith immunity provided by Section                 is applicable.                                    a   If a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person has                           violated a court order or agreement executed pursuant to Subsection     the officer shall,                           without a warrant, arrest the alleged violator.                                b   Any person who knowingly violates a court order or agreement executed pursuant                              to Subsection     shall be guilty as follows                                 i   if the original arrest was for a felony, an offense under this section is a third degree                           felony  or                                ii   if the original arrest was for a misdemeanor, an offense under this section is a class                           A misdemeanor.                                c   City attorneys may prosecute class A misdemeanor violations under this section.                                    An individual who was originally arrested for a felony under this chapter and                           released pursuant to this section may subsequently be held without bail if there is substantial                           evidence to support a new felony charge against him.                                    At the time an arrest for domestic violence is made, the arresting officer shall                           provide  both  the alleged victim  and the alleged perpetrator  with written notice containing                           the following information                                 a   the requirements described in Subsection    , and notice that those requirements                           shall be ordered by a court or must be agreed to by the alleged perpetrator prior to release                                 b   notification of the penalties for violation of the court order or any agreement                           executed under Subsection                                     c   the date and time, absent modification by a court or magistrate, that the                           requirements expire                                 d   the address of the appropriate court in the district or county in which the alleged                           victim resides                                 e   the availability and effect of any waiver of the requirements  and                                f   information regarding the availability of and procedures for obtaining civil and                           criminal protective orders with or without the assistance of an attorney.                                    At the time an arrest for domestic violence is made, the arresting officer shall                          provide the alleged perpetrator with written notice containing the following information                                 a   the requirements described in Subsection     and notice that those requirements                          shall be ordered by a court or must be agreed to by the alleged perpetrator prior to release                                 b   notification of the penalties for violation of the court or any agreement executed                          under Subsection      and                                c   the date and time absent modification by a court or magistrate that the requirements                          expire.                                             In addition to the provisions of Subsections     through    , because of the                           unique and highly emotional nature of domestic violence crimes, the high recidivism rate of                           violent offenders, and the demonstrated increased risk of continued acts of violence subsequent                           to the release of an offender who has been arrested for domestic violence, it is the finding of                           the Legislature that domestic violence crimes, as defined in Section                , are crimes for                           which bail may be denied if there is substantial evidence to support the charge, and if the court                           finds by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged perpetrator would constitute a                           substantial danger to an alleged victim of domestic violence if released on bail.  If bail is                           denied under this Subsection          , it shall be under the terms and conditions described in                           Subsections     through    .
