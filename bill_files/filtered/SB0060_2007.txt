Delegating management and investment functions.                                     a   Subject to any specific limitation set forth in a gift instrument or in law other                           than this chapter, an institution may delegate to an external agent the management and                           investment of an institutional fund to the extent that an institution could prudently delegate                           under the circumstances.                                 b   An institution shall act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person                           in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, in                                  i   selecting an agent                                  ii   establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes of                           the institution and the institutional fund  and                                 iii   periodically reviewing the agent s actions in order to monitor the agent s                           performance and compliance with the scope and terms of the delegation.                                        In performing a delegated function, an agent owes a duty to the institution to                           exercise reasonable care to comply with the scope and terms of the delegation.                                     An institution that complies with Subsection     is not liable for the decisions or                           actions of an agent to which the function was delegated.                                     By accepting delegation of a management or investment function from an                           institution that is subject to the laws of this state, an agent submits to the jurisdiction of the                           courts of this state in all proceedings arising from or related to the delegation or the                           performance of the delegated function.                                     An institution may delegate management and investment functions to its                           committees, officers, or employees as authorized by law other than this chapter.

If an institution determines that a restriction contained in a gift instrument on the                           management, investment, or purpose of an institutional fund is unlawful, impracticable,                           impossible to achieve, or wasteful, the institution,    days after notification to the attorney                           general, may release or modify the restriction, in whole or part, if                                  a   the institutional fund subject to the restriction has a total value of less than    ,                                     b   more than    years have elapsed since the fund was established  and                                 c   the institution uses the property in a manner the institution reasonably determines to                           be consistent with the charitable purposes expressed in the gift instrument.
