premiums in any specific or approximate amounts, but reporting fully and accurately past                               experience is not false or misleading information  and                                 B   with intent to deceive a person examining it                                  I   filing a report                                  II   making a false entry in a record  or                                 III   wilfully refraining from making a proper entry in a record.                                 iii   A licensee under this title may not                                  A   use any business name, slogan, emblem, or related device that is misleading or                            likely to cause the insurer or other licensee to be mistaken for another insurer or other licensee

reasonable person to mistakenly believe that a state or federal government agency                                  I   is responsible for the insurance sales activities of the person

   IV   is a source of payment of any insurance obligation of or sold by the person.                                 iv   A person who is not an insurer may not assume or use any name that deceptively                            implies or suggests that person is an insurer.                                 v   A person other than persons licensed as health maintenance organizations under                            Chapter   may not use the term  Health Maintenance Organization  or  HMO  in referring to                            itself.                                 b  A licensee s violation creates a rebuttable presumption that the violation was also                            committed by the insurer if                                  i   the licensee under this title distributes cards or documents, exhibits a sign, or                            publishes an advertisement that violates Subsection     a , with reference to a particular                            insurer                                  A   that the licensee represents  or                                 B   for whom the licensee processes claims  and                                 ii   the cards, documents, signs, or advertisements are supplied or approved by that                               insurer.                                     a   i  A licensee under this title, or an officer or employee of a licensee may not                            induce any person to enter into or continue an insurance contract or to terminate an existing                            insurance contract by offering benefits not specified in the policy to be issued or continued,                            including premium or commission rebates.                                 ii   An insurer may not make or knowingly allow any agreement of insurance that is                            not clearly expressed in the policy to be issued or renewed.                                 iii   This Subsection     a  does not preclude                                  A   insurers from reducing premiums because of expense savings                                  B   the usual kinds of social courtesies not related to particular transactions  or                                 C   an insurer from receiving premiums under an installment payment plan.                                 b   A licensee under this title may not absorb the tax under Section       A          .                                 c   i   A title insurer or producer or any officer or employee of either may not pay,                            allow, give, or offer to pay, allow, or give, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to obtaining                            any title insurance business                                  A   any rebate, reduction, or abatement of any rate or charge made incident to the                            issuance of the title insurance                                  B   any special favor or advantage not generally available to others  or                                 C   any money or other consideration except if approved under Section       A            or                                 D   material inducement.                                 ii    Charge made incident to the issuance of the title insurance  includes escrow                            charges, and any other services that are prescribed in rule by the Title and Escrow Commission                            after consultation with the commissioner and subject to Section       A         .                                 iii   An insured or any other person connected, directly or indirectly, with the                            transaction, including a mortgage lender, real estate broker, builder, attorney, or any officer,                            employee, or agent of any of them, may not knowingly receive or accept, directly or indirectly,                            any benefit referred to in Subsection     c  i .                                     a   An insurer may not unfairly discriminate among policyholders by charging                               different premiums or by offering different terms of coverage, except on the basis of                            classifications related to the nature and the degree of the risk covered or the expenses involved.                                 b   Rates are not unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among persons                            insured under a group, blanket, or franchise policy, and the terms of those policies are not                            unfairly discriminatory merely because they are more favorable than in similar individual                            policies.                                     a   This Subsection     applies to                                  i   a person who is or should be licensed under this title                                  ii   an employee of that licensee or person who should be licensed                                  iii   a person whose primary interest is as a competitor of a person licensed under this                            title  and                                 iv   one acting on behalf of any person described in Subsections     a  i  through  iii .                                 b   A person described in Subsection     a  may not commit or enter into any                            agreement to participate in any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation that                                  i   tends to produce                                  A   an unreasonable restraint of the business of insurance  or                                 B   a monopoly in that business  or                                 ii   results in an applicant purchasing or replacing an insurance contract.                                     a   i   Subject to Subsection     a  ii , a person may not restrict in the choice of an                            insurer or licensee under this chapter, another person who is required to pay for insurance as a                            condition for the conclusion of a contract or other transaction or for the exercise of any right                            under a contract.                                 ii   A person requiring coverage may reserve the right to disapprove the insurer or the                            coverage selected on reasonable grounds.                                 b   The form of corporate organization of an insurer authorized to do business in this                            state is not a reasonable ground for disapproval, and the commissioner may by rule specify                            additional grounds that are not reasonable.  This Subsection     does not bar an insurer from                            declining an application for insurance.                                        A person may not make any charge other than insurance premiums and premium                            financing charges for the protection of property or of a security interest in property, as a                            condition for obtaining, renewing, or continuing the financing of a purchase of the property or                            the lending of money on the security of an interest in the property.                                     a   A licensee under this title may not refuse or fail to return promptly all indicia of                            agency to the principal on demand.                                 b   A licensee whose license is suspended, limited, or revoked under Section                               A          ,       A   a        , or       A   a         may not refuse or fail to return the license to the                            commissioner on demand.                                     a   A person may not engage in any other unfair method of competition or any other                            unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance, as defined by the commissioner                            by rule, after a finding that they                                  i   are misleading                                  ii   are deceptive                                  iii   are unfairly discriminatory                                  iv   provide an unfair inducement  or                                 v   unreasonably restrain competition.                                 b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , for purpose of the title insurance industry, the                            Title and Escrow Commission shall make rules,  in accordance with Title   , Chapter   a,                           Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act  subject to Section       A         , that define any other                            unfair method of competition or any other unfair or deceptive act or practice after a finding that                            they                                  i   are misleading                                  ii   are deceptive                                  iii   are unfairly discriminatory                                  iv   provide an unfair inducement  or                                 v   unreasonably restrain competition.
