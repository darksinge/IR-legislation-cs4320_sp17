This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                       , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody           consideration.                   If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is declared          void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the minor          children as it considers appropriate. In determining custody, the court shall consider the best          interests of the child and the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties.          The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s desires regarding          the future custody, but the expressed desires are not controlling and the court may determine the          children s custody otherwise.                   In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds          relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing the          child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate.                   If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has attempted          to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into consideration in           determining whether to award custody to the other parent.                  a   In cases decided under this section, a court may not take into account a parent s         disability, as defined in Section        , in awarding custody or in determining whether a         substantial change has occurred for the purposes of modifying an award of custody unless it is         shown by clear and convincing evidence that the disability significantly and substantially inhibits         a parent s ability to provide for the basic physical and emotional needs of the child at issue.              b   If the court takes a parent s disability into account under Subsection  a , the parent with         a disability may rebut any evidence or inference arising therefrom by showing that               i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to provide          for the basic physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or               ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources available          to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the basic physical and emotional needs of the child          at issue.               c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to                i   abuse, neglect, or dependency proceedings under Title   A, Chapter  a, Family          Services, or Title   , Chapter  a, Juvenile Courts  or               ii   adoption proceedings under Title   , Chapter   , Adoption.
