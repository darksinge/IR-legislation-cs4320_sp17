B   An employer or  its  the employer s insurance carrier may not reduce compensation       payable under this Subsection     b  iii  on or after May  ,     , to a wholly dependent person       by an amount related to a cost of living increase to the social security death benefits that the       wholly dependent person is first eligible to receive for a week, notwithstanding whether the       employee is injured on or before May  ,     .             C   For purposes of a wholly dependent person whose compensation payable is reduced       under this Subsection     b  iii  on or before May  ,     , the reduction is limited to the       amount of the reduction as of May  ,     .             iv   The issue of dependency is subject to review at the end of the initial     week       period and annually after the initial     week period.  If in a review it is determined that, under       the facts and circumstances existing at that time, the applicant is no longer a wholly dependent       person, the applicant              A   may be considered a partly dependent or nondependent person  and             B   shall be paid the benefits as may be determined under Subsection     d  iii .             c   i   For purposes of a dependency determination, a surviving spouse of a deceased       employee is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for a     week period from the date        of death of the employee.  This presumption does not apply after the initial     week period.              ii   A   In determining the annual income of the surviving spouse after the initial            week period, there shall be excluded     of a federal social security death benefit that the        surviving spouse               I   is eligible to receive for a week as of the first day the surviving spouse is eligible to        receive a Social Security death benefit  and              II   receives.              B   An employer or  its  the employer s insurance carrier may not reduce compensation        payable under this Subsection     c  ii  on or after May  ,     , to a surviving spouse by an        amount related to a cost of living increase to the social security death benefits that the surviving        spouse is first eligible to receive for a week, notwithstanding whether the employee is injured on        or before May  ,     .              C   For purposes of a surviving spouse whose compensation payable is reduced under        this Subsection     c  ii  on or before May  ,     , the reduction is limited to the amount of the        reduction as of May  ,     .              d   i   If there is a partly dependent person at the time of the death, the payment shall        be               A   subject to Subsections     d  i  B  and  C ,         of the decedent s average        weekly wage at the time of the injury               B   not more than a maximum of     of the state average weekly wage at the time of        the injury per week  and              C   not less than a minimum of     per week.              ii   Compensation shall continue during dependency for the remainder of the period        between the date of death and the expiration of     weeks after the date of injury.         Compensation may not amount to more than a maximum of    ,   .              iii   The benefits provided for in this Subsection     d  shall be in keeping with the        circumstances and conditions of dependency existing at the date of injury, and any amount paid        under this Subsection     d  shall be consistent with the general provisions of this chapter and        Chapter  , Utah Occupational Disease Act.              iv   Benefits to a person determined to be partly dependent under Subsection     c                A   shall be determined in keeping with the circumstances and conditions of        dependency existing at the time of the dependency review  and              B   may be paid in an amount not exceeding the maximum weekly rate that a partly        dependent person would receive if wholly dependent.              v  A payment under this section shall be paid to a person during a person s dependency        by the employer or  its  the employer s insurance carrier.              e   i   Subject to Subsection     e  ii , if there is a wholly dependent person and also a        partly dependent person at the time of death, the benefits may be apportioned in a manner        consistent with Section   A      .              ii   The total benefits awarded to all parties concerned may not exceed the maximum        provided for by law.                  The Employers  Reinsurance Fund               a   shall be               i   used only in accordance with Subsection     for               A   the purpose of making a payment for an industrial accident or occupational disease        occurring on or before June   ,     , in accordance with this section and Section   A               and              B   payment of               I   reasonable costs of administering the Employers  Reinsurance Fund  or              II   fees required to be paid by the Employers  Reinsurance Fund               ii   expended according to processes that can be verified by audit  and              b   may not be used for               i   administrative costs unrelated to the Employers  Reinsurance Fund  or              ii  an activity of the commission other than an activity described in Subsection     a .
