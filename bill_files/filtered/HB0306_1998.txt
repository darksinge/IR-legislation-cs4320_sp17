CAPITOL SENTENCING AMENDMENTS                 GENERAL SESSION          STATE OF UTAH           Sponsor   David  Ure          AN ACT RELATING TO THE CRIMINAL CODE  AMENDING PROCEDURES         REGARDING JURY PARTICIPATION IN THE SENTENCING PROCEEDINGS IN         CAPITAL FELONY CASES.         This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows          AMENDS                        , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section           is amended to read                        .  Capital felony    Sentencing proceeding.                   a   When a defendant has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a capital felony, there          shall be further proceedings before the court or jury on the issue of sentence.               b   In the case of a plea of guilty to a capital felony, the sentencing proceedings shall be          conducted before a jury or, upon request of the defendant and with the approval of the court and          the consent of the prosecution, by the court which accepted the plea  or by a jury upon request of          the defendant .               c   i   When a defendant has been found guilty of a capital felony, the proceedings shall          be conducted before the court or jury which found the defendant guilty, provided the defendant          may waive hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the          prosecution, in which event the hearing shall be before the court.               ii   If, however, circumstances make it impossible or impractical to reconvene the same          jury for the sentencing proceedings, the court may dismiss that jury and convene a new jury for           such  the proceedings.               d   If a retrial of the sentencing proceedings is necessary as a consequence of a remand           from an appellate court, the sentencing authority shall be determined as provided in Subsection                  .                  a   In capital sentencing proceedings, evidence may be presented on               i   the nature and circumstances of the crime               ii   the defendant s character, background, history, mental and physical condition               iii   the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim s family and community without         comparison to other persons or victims  and              iv   any other facts in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty that the court considers         relevant to the sentence.               b   Any evidence the court considers to have probative force may be received regardless          of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.  The state s attorney and the defendant          shall be permitted to present argument for or against the sentence of death.                   Aggravating circumstances  shall  include those outlined in Section         .           Mitigating circumstances  shall  include                a   the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity                b   the homicide was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental          or emotional disturbance                c   the defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person                d   at the time of the homicide, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the          wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of law was impaired as          a result of mental disease, intoxication, or influence of drugs                e   the youth of the defendant at the time of the crime                f   the defendant was an accomplice in the homicide committed by another person and the          defendant s participation was relatively minor  and               g   any other fact in mitigation of the penalty.                   a   The court or jury, as the case may be, shall retire to consider the penalty.  Except          as provided in Subsection         .    , in all proceedings before a jury, under this section, it          shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon a unanimous decision for death and          that the penalty of either life in prison or life in prison without parole, shall be imposed if a          unanimous decision for death is not found.               b   The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the                 aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that         total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt,         that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.  If the         jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall discharge the         jury and shall impose the sentence of death.              c   If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision imposing the sentence of death,         except as provided in Subsection         .    , the jury shall then determine whether the penalty         of life in prison without parole shall be imposed.  The penalty of life in prison without parole shall         only be imposed if the jury determines that the sentence of life in prison without parole is          appropriate.  If the jury reports agreement by ten jurors or more to impose the sentence of life in          prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of life in          prison without parole.  If ten jurors or more do not agree upon a sentence of life in prison without          parole, the court shall discharge the jury and impose the sentence of life imprisonment with the          possibility of parole.               d   If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, with the approval of          the court and the consent of the prosecution, the court shall determine the appropriate penalty          according to the standards of this subsection.                   Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate court,          if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence of death          and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent necessary to          correct the error or errors.  No error in the sentencing proceedings shall result in the reversal of the          conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing proceedings, all exhibits and          a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial and sentencing          proceedings shall be admissible in the new sentencing proceedings, and if the sentencing          proceeding was before a                a   jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding unless the          defendant waives the hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the          prosecution, in which case the proceeding shall be held according to Subsection     b  or  c , as          applicable                b   judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding  or               c   judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new sentencing                 proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing proceeding, and         the new proceeding will be before a jury unless the defendant waives the hearing before the jury         with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecution.                  In the event the death penalty is held to be unconstitutional by the Utah Supreme Court         or the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously         sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the person to be brought before the court, and         the court shall sentence the person to life in prison, if the death penalty is held unconstitutional         prior to April   ,     , or life in prison without parole if the death penalty is held unconstitutional         on or after April   ,     , and any person who is thereafter convicted of a capital felony shall be          sentenced to life in prison or life in prison without parole.
