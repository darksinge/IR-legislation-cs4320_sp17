Hickman          AN ACT RELATING TO HIGHER EDUCATION  PROVIDING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL         WHO HAS BEEN HONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMED         FORCES IS ENTITLED TO RESIDENT STATUS FOR TUITION PURPOSES AT PUBLIC         HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS  AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.         This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                  B      , as enacted by Chapters    and    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section    B       is amended to read                  B      .  Definition of resident student.                   The meaning of  resident student  is determined by reference to the general law on the          subject of domicile, except that the following rules are applicable                    An adult who has come to Utah and established residency for the purpose of attending          an institution of higher education must maintain continuous Utah residency status for one full year          prior to the beginning of the academic period for which registration as a resident student is sought,          and, in each case, must demonstrate by additional objective evidence the establishment of a          domicile in Utah and that the student does not maintain a residence elsewhere.                   Except as provided in Subsection    , the domicile of a minor student is determined          according to the following standards                a   Unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, the domicile of a minor is          normally that of the minor s father, or if the father is dead, that of the minor s mother. If both          parents are dead, it is normally the domicile of the most recently deceased parent, or, if there is a          duly appointed guardian, then the minor s domicile is that of the duly appointed guardian.                b   A minor whose parents move to Utah to establish a permanent domicile, and not for         the primary purpose of allowing the minor to attend an institution of higher education as a resident,         is immediately eligible to register as a resident student.              c   A minor enrolled as a resident student will not lose that classification because his         parents or guardian remove their legal residence from the state during the continuous period of the         minor s higher education, unless the parents or guardian came to the state as a means of gaining         residency for the minor.                  a   If the custody of a minor has been granted to any person by court order or by foster         placement with Utah resident families if the placement has been made by a licensed child          placement agency, the domicile of the person to whom custody was awarded constitutes the          domicile of the minor.               b   If the minor s parents are divorced or separated, but custody has not been awarded, the          minor s domicile is determined from all of the relevant circumstances.               c   The domicile of a person in loco parentis to an abandoned minor constitutes the          domicile of the abandoned minor, if the abandonment was not for the purpose of enabling the          minor to qualify for resident status.               d   If the abandonment of a minor was for the purpose of enabling the minor to qualify for          resident status, the domicile of the minor is determined from all of the relevant circumstances          without regard for the abandonment.               e   An emancipated minor may qualify for residence under the rules applicable to adults,          provided that the board has adopted standards under Subsection     for determining whether a          minor is emancipated.                   a   Personnel of the United States Armed Forces assigned to active duty in Utah, and          the immediate members of their families residing with them in this state are entitled to resident          status for tuition purposes.               b   Upon the termination of active duty status, the military personnel and their family          members are governed by the standards applicable to nonmilitary persons, except as provided in          Subsection     c .               c   An individual who has received an honorable discharge from the United States Armed          Forces is entitled to resident status for tuition purposes at institutions within the state s higher          education system.                          a   Aliens who are present in the United States on visitor, student, or other visas which         authorize only temporary presence in this country, do not have the capacity to intend to reside in         Utah for an indefinite period and therefore are classified as nonresidents.              b   Aliens who have been granted immigrant or permanent resident status in the United         States are classified for purposes of resident status according to the same criteria applicable to         citizens.                  The board, after consultation with the institutions, shall make rules not inconsistent         with this section, concerning the definition of resident and nonresident students and establishing         procedures for classifying and reclassifying students and criteria for judging claims of residency,          domicile, emancipation, abandonment, and other matters related to this section.                   Any American Indian who is enrolled on the tribal rolls of a tribe whose reservation          or trust lands lie partly or wholly within Utah or whose border is at any point contiguous with the          border of Utah, and any American Indian who is a member of a federally recognized or known          Utah tribe and who has graduated from a high school in Utah, is entitled to resident student status.                   Other institutions within the system shall honor a determination by an institution that          a person is a resident student unless the determination was obtained by false pretenses or the facts          which existed at the time of the determination have materially changed.               Section  .   Effective date.              This act takes effect on July  ,     .
