The chair shall       appoint members to the panels in any combination and in accordance with rules promulgated       by the board, except in hearings involving commutation and pardons.  The chair may       participate on any panel and when doing so is chair of the panel.

Decisions of the board in cases involving paroles, pardons, commutations or       terminations of sentence, restitution, or remission of fines or forfeitures are final and are not       subject to judicial review.  Nothing in this section prevents the obtaining or enforcement of a       civil judgment, including restitution as provided in Section        .                 This chapter may not be construed as a denial of or limitation of the governor s       power to grant respite or reprieves in all cases of convictions for offenses against the state,       except treason or conviction on impeachment.  However, respites or reprieves may not extend       beyond the next session of the Board of Pardons and Parole and the board, at that session, shall       continue or terminate the respite or reprieve, or it may commute the punishment, or pardon the       offense as provided.  In the case of conviction for treason, the governor may suspend execution       of the sentence until the case is reported to the Legislature at its next session.  The Legislature       shall then either pardon or commute the sentence, or direct its execution.                 In determining when, where, and under what conditions offenders serving sentences       may be paroled, pardoned, have restitution ordered, or have their fines or forfeitures remitted,       or their sentences commuted or terminated, the board shall consider whether the persons have       made or are prepared to make restitution as ascertained in accordance with the standards and       procedures of Section      a    , as a condition of any parole, pardon, remission of fines or       forfeitures, or commutation or termination of sentence.                 In determining whether parole may be terminated, the board shall consider the       offense committed by the parolee, the parole period as provided in Section         , and in       accordance with Section         .            Section  .  Section         is amended to read                    . Payment of restitution.                 When the Board of Pardons and Parole orders the release on parole of an inmate       who has been sentenced to make restitution pursuant to Title   , Chapter   a, Crime Victims       Restitution Act, or whom the board has ordered to make restitution, and all or a portion of       restitution is still owing, the board may establish a schedule, including both complete and       court ordered restitution, by which payment of the restitution shall be made, or order       compensatory or other service in lieu of or in combination with restitution. In fixing the       schedule and supervising the paroled offender s performance, the board may consider the       factors specified in Section      a    .                 a   The board may impose any court order for restitution.             b   In accordance with Subsection      a        d   ii   iii  A , the board may order       that a defendant make restitution for pecuniary damages that were not determined by the court,       unless the board applying the criteria as set forth in Section      a     determines that       restitution is inappropriate.             c   Except as provided in Subsection     d , the board shall make all orders of       restitution within    days after the termination or expiration of the defendant s sentence.              d   If, upon termination or expiration of a defendant s sentence, the board has        continuing jurisdiction over the defendant for a separate criminal offense, the board may defer        making an order of restitution until termination or expiration of all sentences for that        defendant.                  The board may also make orders of restitution for recovery of any or all costs        incurred by the Department of Corrections or the state or any other agency arising out of the        defendant s needs or conduct.                  If the defendant, upon termination or expiration of the sentence owes outstanding        fines, restitution, or other assessed costs, or if the board makes an order of restitution within           days after the termination or expiration of the defendant s sentence, the matter shall be referred        to the district court for civil collection remedies.  The Board of Pardons and Parole shall        forward a restitution order to the sentencing court to be entered on the judgment docket.
