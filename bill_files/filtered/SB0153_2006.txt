For the purposes of this chapter and Title   , Chapter   , EnvironmentalInstitutional Control Act, an environmental institutional control, as defined in Section                , is considered an environmental covenant.             .As used in this chapter       Activity and use limitations  means restrictions or obligations created under thischapter with respect to real property.      Agency  means the Utah Department of Environmental Quality or other state orfederal agency that determines or approves the environmental response project under which theenvironmental covenant is created.      Common interest community  means a condominium, cooperative, or other realproperty with respect to which a person, by virtue of the person s ownership of a parcel of realproperty, is obligated to pay property taxes or insurance premiums, or for maintenance, orimprovement of other real property described in a recorded covenant that creates the commoninterest community.      Environmental covenant  means a servitude arising under an environmentalresponse project that imposes activity and use limitations.      Environmental response project  means a plan, risk assessment, or workperformed for environmental remediation of real property or surface and groundwater on orbeneath the real property and conducted  a   under a federal or state program governing environmental remediation of realproperty, including under Title   , Environmental Quality Code  b   incident to closure of a solid or hazardous waste management unit, if the closure isconducted with approval of an agency  or c   under the state voluntary clean up program authorized in Title   , Chapter  ,Voluntary Cleanup Program.      Holder  means the grantee of an environmental covenant as specified inSubsection                     .      Jurisdiction  means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, PuertoRico, the United States Virgin Islands, or any territory or insular possession subject to thejurisdiction of the United States.      Record,  used as a noun, means information that is inscribed on a tangible mediumor that is stored in an electronic or other medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.             .     a   Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property, theagency, or a municipality or other unit of local government, may be a holder. b   An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder. c   The interest of a holder is an interest in real property.     A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, otherthan a right as a holder, is not an interest in real property.     a   An agency is bound by any obligation it affirmatively assumes in anenvironmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing anenvironmental covenant. b   Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligationsthe person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations,rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as providedin the covenant.     The following requirements apply to interests in real property in existence at thetime an environmental covenant is created or amended  a   An interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmentalcovenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant. b   This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate thatinterest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant. c   i   A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenantcovering real property or in a separate record. ii   If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a commoninterest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing boardof the owners  association. d   An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmentalcovenant affects the priority of that person s interest but does not by itself impose anyaffirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant.             .     An environmental covenant must  a   state that the instrument is an environmental covenant executed under this chapter  b   contain a legally sufficient description of the real property subject to the covenant  c   describe the activity and use limitations on the real property  d   identify every holder  e   be signed by the agency, every holder, and unless waived by the agency, everyowner of the fee simple of the real property subject to the covenant  and f   identify the name and location of any administrative record for the environmentalresponse project reflected in the environmental covenant.     In addition to the information required by Subsection    , an environmentalcovenant may contain other information, restrictions, and requirements agreed to by thepersons who signed it, including any  a   requirements for notice following transfer of a specified interest in, or concerningproposed changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site workaffecting the contamination on, the property subject to the covenant  b   requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant  c   rights of access to the property granted in connection with implementation orenforcement of the covenant  d   a brief narrative description of the contamination and remedy, including  i   the contaminants of concern  ii   the pathways of exposure  iii   limits on exposure  and iv   the location and extent of the contamination  e   limitation on amendment or termination of the covenant in addition to thosecontained in Sections                   and                    and f   rights of the holder in addition to its right to enforce the covenant under Section                .     In addition to other conditions for its approval of an environmental covenant, theagency may require those persons specified by the agency who have interests in the realproperty to sign the covenant.             .     An environmental covenant that complies with this chapter runs with the land.     An environmental covenant that is otherwise effective is valid and enforceable evenif  a   it is not appurtenant to an interest in real property  b   it can be or has been assigned to a person other than the original holder  c   it is not of a character that has been recognized traditionally at common law  d   it imposes a negative burden  e   it imposes an affirmative obligation on a person having an interest in the realproperty or on the holder  f   the benefit or burden does not touch or concern real property  g   there is no privity of estate or contract  h   the holder dies, ceases to exist, resigns, or is replaced  or i   the owner of an interest subject to the environmental covenant and the holder are thesame person.     a   An instrument that creates restrictions or obligations with respect to realproperty that would qualify as activity and use limitations except for the fact that theinstrument was recorded before the effective date of this chapter is not invalid or unenforceablebecause of any of the limitations on enforcement of interests described in Subsection     orbecause it was identified as an easement, servitude, deed restriction, or other interest. b   This chapter does not apply in any other respect to an instrument covered underSubsection     a .     This chapter does not invalidate or render unenforceable any interest, whetherdesignated as an environmental covenant or other interest, that is otherwise enforceable underUtah law.             .     This chapter does not authorize a use of real property that is otherwise prohibitedby  a   a zoning law  b   law other than this chapter regulating use of real property  or c   a recorded instrument that has priority over the environmental covenant.     An environmental covenant may prohibit or restrict uses of real property that areauthorized by zoning or by law other than this chapter.             .     A copy of an environmental covenant shall be provided by the persons and in themanner required by the agency to  a   each person that signed the covenant  b   each person holding a recorded interest in the real property subject to the covenant  c   each person in possession of the real property subject to the covenant  d   each municipality or other unit of local government in which real property subjectto the covenant is located  and e   any other person that the agency requires.     The validity of a covenant is not affected by failure to provide a copy of thecovenant as required under this section.             .     a   An environmental covenant and any amendment or termination of the covenantmust be recorded in every county in which any portion of the real property subject to thecovenant is located. b   For purposes of indexing, a holder shall be treated as a grantee.     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection                     , an environmentalcovenant is subject to Utah laws governing recording and priority of interests in real property.             .     An environmental covenant is perpetual unless it is  a   i   limited to a specific duration by its terms  or ii   terminated by the occurrence of a specific event  b   terminated by consent under Section                    c   terminated under Subsection      d   terminated by foreclosure of an interest that has priority over the environmentalcovenant  or e   terminated or modified in an eminent domain proceeding, but only if  i   the agency that signed the covenant is a party to the proceeding  ii   all persons identified in Subsections                      and     are given notice of thependency of the proceeding  and iii   the court determines, after hearing, that the termination or modification will notadversely affect human health or the environment.     a   If the agency that signed an environmental covenant has determined that theintended benefits of the covenant can no longer be realized, a court, under the doctrine ofchanged circumstances, in an action in which all persons identified in Subsections                    and     have been given notice, may terminate the covenant or reduce its burdenon the real property subject to the covenant. b   The Department of Environmental Quality s determination under Subsection     a or its failure to make a determination upon request is subject to review under Title   , Chapter  b, Administrative Procedures Act. c   A federal agency s determination under Subsection     a  or its failure to make adetermination upon request is subject to review under applicable federal law.     Except as otherwise provided in Subsections     and    , an environmentalcovenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired through issuance of a tax deed,foreclosure of a tax lien, or application of the doctrine of adverse possession, prescription,abandonment, waiver, lack of enforcement, or acquiescence, or a similar doctrine.     An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired byapplication of Title   , Chapter  , Marketable Record Title.             .     An environmental covenant may be amended or terminated by consent only if theamendment or termination is signed by  a   the agency  b   unless waived by the agency, the current owner of the fee simple of the realproperty subject to the covenant  c   each person that originally signed the covenant, unless  i   the person waived in a signed record the right to consent  ii   the executive director of the Department of Environmental Quality finds that theperson  A   no longer exists  B   is not legally competent to sign the amendment or termination  or C   cannot be located or identified with the exercise of reasonable diligence  or iii   a court finds that the person no longer exists or cannot be located or identified withthe exercise of reasonable diligence  and d   except as otherwise provided in Subsection     b , the holder.     If an interest in real property is subject to an environmental covenant, the interest isnot affected by an amendment of the covenant unless the current owner of the interest consentsto the amendment or has waived in a signed record the right to consent to amendments.     Except for an assignment undertaken under a governmental reorganization,assignment of an environmental covenant to a new holder is an amendment.     Except as otherwise provided in an environmental covenant  a   a holder may not assign its interest without consent of the other parties  and b   a holder may be removed and replaced by agreement of the other parties specifiedin Subsection    .     A court of competent jurisdiction may fill a vacancy in the position of holder.     A person required by Subsection     to sign the amendment or termination mayauthorize in writing another person to sign the amendment or termination on the person sbehalf.             .     A civil action for injunctive or other equitable relief for violation of anenvironmental covenant may be maintained by  a   a party to the covenant  b   the agency  c   any person to whom the covenant expressly grants power to enforce  d   a person whose interest in the real property or whose collateral or liability may beaffected by the alleged violation of the covenant  or e   a municipality or other unit of local government in which the real property subjectto the covenant is located.     This chapter does not limit the regulatory authority of the agency under law otherthan this chapter with respect to an environmental response project.     A person is not responsible for or subject to liability for environmental remediationsolely because the person has the right to enforce an environmental covenant.     In addition to Subsection    , an agency may recover its costs for actions which, inits discretion, it may take to enforce or protect the environmental covenant.             .In applying and construing this chapter, consideration must be given to the need topromote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among jurisdictions that enactit.             .This chapter modifies, limits, or supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Globaland National Commerce Act,    U.S.C.

A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, other                           than a right as a holder, is not an interest in real property.                                     a   An agency is bound by any obligation it affirmatively assumes in an                           environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an                           environmental covenant.                                    b   Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations                           the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations,                           rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided                           in the covenant.

If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held                           invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter that can be                           given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this                           chapter are severable.
