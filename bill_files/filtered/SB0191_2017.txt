The board may order the establishment of drilling units for a pool.                  Within each drilling unit, only one well may be drilled for production from the        common source of supply, except as provided in Subsections     and    .                  A drilling unit may not be smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently        and economically drained by one well.                  a   Each drilling unit within a pool shall be of uniform size and shape, unless the        board finds that it must make an exception due to geologic, geographic, or other factors.              b   If the board finds it necessary to divide a pool into zones and establish drilling units        for each zone, drilling units may differ in size and shape for each zone.                  An order of the board that establishes drilling units for a pool shall               a   be made upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable               b   include all lands determined by the board to overlay the pool               c   specify the acreage and shape of each drilling unit as determined by the board  and              d   specify the location of the well in terms of distance from drilling unit boundaries        and other wells.                  The board may establish a drilling unit and concurrently authorize the drilling of        more than one well in a drilling unit if the board finds that               a   engineering or geologic characteristics justify the drilling of more than one well in        that drilling unit  and              b   the drilling of more than one well in the drilling unit will not result in waste.                  The board may modify an order that establishes drilling units for a pool to provide        for               a   an exception to the authorized location of a well               b   the inclusion of additional areas which the board determines overlays the pool               c   the increase or decrease of the size of drilling units  or              d   the drilling of additional wells within drilling units.                  a   An order of the board that establishes a drilling unit may be made effective        retroactively to the date of first production of an existing well located within the drilling unit if        no party to the board s proceeding objects to the retroactive application.              b   An order made retroactive under this section is binding upon a party owning an        interest in the drilling unit who receives proper notice of the board s proceeding.                        a   After an order establishing drilling units has been entered by the board, the        drilling of a well into the pool at a location other than that authorized by the order is prohibited.              b   The operation of a well drilled in violation of an order fixing drilling units is        prohibited.

If a nonconsenting owner s tract in the drilling unit is subject to a lease or other        contract for the development of oil and gas, the pooling order shall provide that the consenting        owners shall pay any royalty interest or other interest in the tract not subject to the deduction of        the costs of production from the production attributable to that tract.                  a   If a nonconsenting owner s tract in the drilling unit is not subject to a lease or        other contract for the development of oil and gas, the pooling order shall provide that the        nonconsenting owner shall receive as a royalty               i   the acreage weighted average landowner s royalty based on each leased fee and        privately owned tract within the drilling unit, proportionately reduced by the percentage of the        nonconsenting owner s interest in the drilling unit  or              ii   if there is no leased fee or privately owned tract within the drilling unit other than        the one owned by the nonconsenting owner,         proportionately reduced by the        percentage of the nonconsenting owner s interest in the drilling unit.              b   The royalty shall be               i   determined prior to the commencement of drilling  and              ii   paid from production attributable to each tract until the consenting owners have        recovered the costs specified in Subsection     d .                  Once the consenting owners have recovered the costs, as described in Subsection            b  ii , the royalty shall be merged back into the nonconsenting owner s working interest and        shall be terminated.

Each pooling order shall provide that when the consenting owners recover from a        nonconsenting owner s relinquished interest the amounts provided for in Subsection     d                a   the relinquished interest of the nonconsenting owner shall automatically revert to        him               b   the nonconsenting owner shall from that time               i   own the same interest in the well and the production from it  and              ii   be liable for the further costs of the operation as if he had participated in the initial        drilling and operation  and              c   costs are payable out of production unless otherwise agreed between the        nonconsenting owner and the operator.                   Each pooling order shall provide that in any circumstance where the        nonconsenting owner has relinquished his share of production to consenting owners or at any        time fails to take his share of production in kind when he is entitled to do so, the        nonconsenting owner is entitled to               a   an accounting of the oil and gas proceeds applicable to his relinquished share of        production  and              b   payment of the oil and gas proceeds applicable to that share of production not taken        in kind, net of costs.                   a   A pooling order may be made effective retroactively to the date of first        production of a well to which it applies, even if the retroactive date predates the board s order        establishing the drilling unit, if no party to the board s proceeding objects to the retroactive        application.              b   A pooling order made retroactive under this section is binding upon a party owning        an interest in the drilling unit who receives proper notice of the board s proceeding.
