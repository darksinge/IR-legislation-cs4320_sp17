Apportioned registration and licensing of interstate vehicles.                   a   An owner or operator of a fleet of commercial vehicles based in this state and          operating in two or more jurisdictions may register commercial vehicles for operation under the          International Registration Plan or the Uniform Vehicle Registration Proration and Reciprocity          Agreement by filing an application with the division.               b   The application shall include information that identifies the vehicle owner, the vehicle,          the miles traveled in each jurisdiction, and other information pertinent to the registration of          apportioned vehicles.               c   Vehicles operated exclusively in this state may not be apportioned.                   a   If no operations were conducted during the preceding year, the application shall          contain a statement of the proposed operations and an estimate of annual mileage for each          jurisdiction.               b   The division may adjust the estimate if the division is not satisfied with its correctness.               c   At renewal, the registrant shall use the actual mileage from the preceding year in          computing fees due each jurisdiction.                    The registration fee for apportioned vehicles shall be determined as follows               a   divide the in jurisdiction miles by the total miles generated during the preceding year               b   total  the fees for each vehicle based on the fees prescribed in Section     a       and              c   multiply the sum obtained under Subsection     b  by the quotient obtained under         Subsection     a .                  Trailers or semitrailers of apportioned fleets may be listed separately as  trailer fleets          with the fees paid according to the total distance those trailers were towed in all jurisdictions         during the preceding year mileage reporting period.                  a   i   When the proper fees have been paid and the property tax or in lieu fee has been          cleared under Section     a     or     a    , a registration card, annual decal, and where          necessary, license plate, will be issued for each unit listed on the application.               ii   An original registration must be carried in each vehicle at all times.               b   Original registration cards for trailers or semitrailers may be carried in the power unit.               c   i   In lieu of a permanent registration card or license plate, the division may issue one          temporary permit authorizing operation of new or unlicensed vehicles until the permanent          registration is completed.               ii   Once a temporary permit is issued, the registration process may not be cancelled.           Registration must be completed and the fees and any property tax or in lieu fee due must be paid          for the vehicle for which the permit was issued.               iii   Temporary permits may not be issued for renewals.               d   i   The division shall issue one distinctive license  plate that displays the letters APP          for apportioned vehicles.               ii   The plate  must  shall be displayed on the front of  the  an apportioned truck tractor          or power unit or on the rear of  the trailer, as appropriate  any other apportioned vehicle.               iii   Distinctive decals displaying the word  apportioned  and the month and year of          expiration shall be issued for each apportioned vehicle.               e   A nonrefundable administrative fee, determined by the Tax Commission pursuant to          Section        . , shall be charged for each temporary permit, registration, or both.                    Vehicles that are apportionally registered are fully registered for  intrastate and          interstate  movements, providing the proper interstate and intrastate authority has been secured.                   a   Vehicles added to an apportioned fleet after the beginning of the registration year                 shall be registered by applying the quotient under Subsection     a  for the original application to         the fees  due for the remainder of the registration year.              b   i   The owner shall maintain and submit complete annual mileage for each vehicle in         each jurisdiction, showing all miles operated by the lessor and lessee.              ii   The fiscal mileage reporting period begins July  , and continues through June    of         the year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the registration year begins.              c   i   An owner operator, who is a lessor, may be the registrant and the vehicle may be         registered in the name of the owner operator.              ii   The identification plates and registration card shall be the property of the lessor and          may reflect both the owner operator s name and that of the carrier as lessee.               iii   The allocation of fees shall be according to the operational records of the          owner operator.               d   i   The lessee may be the registrant of a leased vehicle at the option of the lessor.               ii   If a lessee is the registrant of a leased vehicle, both the lessor s and lessee s name shall          appear on the registration.               iii   The allocation of fees shall be according to the records of the carrier.                   a   Any registrant whose application for apportioned registration has been accepted          shall preserve the records on which the application is based for a period of three years after the          close of the registration year.               b   The records shall be made available to the division upon request for audit as to           accuracy of computations, payments, and assessments for deficiencies, or allowances for credits.               c   An assessment for deficiency or claim for credit may not be made for any period for          which records are no longer required.               d   Interest in the amount prescribed by Section          shall be assessed or paid from          the date due until paid on deficiencies found due after audit.               e   Registrants with deficiencies are subject to the penalties under Section         .               f   The division may enter into agreements with other International Registration Plan          jurisdictions for joint audits.                   All state fees collected shall be deposited in the Transportation Fund.                    If registration is for less than a full year, fees for apportioned registration shall be          assessed according to Section     a     .                      a   i   If the registrant is replacing a vehicle for one withdrawn from the fleet and the new         vehicle is of the same weight category as the replaced vehicle, the registrant must file a         supplemental application.              ii   A registration card that transfers the license plate to the new vehicle shall be issued.              iii   When a replacement vehicle is of greater weight than the replaced vehicle, additional         registration fees are due.              b   If a vehicle is withdrawn from an apportioned fleet during the period for which it is         registered, the registrant shall notify the division and surrender the  registration card and license         plate of the withdrawn vehicle.                    a   An out of state carrier with an apportionally registered vehicle who has not          presented a certificate of property tax or in lieu fee as required by Section     a     or     a    ,           shall pay, at the time of registration, a proportional part of an equalized highway use tax computed          as follows                i   Multiply the number of vehicles or combination vehicles registered in each weight class          by the equivalent tax figure from the following table                       Vehicle or Combination    Equivalent                          Registered Weight     Tax                       ,        ,    pounds                                ,        ,    pounds                                 ,        ,    pounds                                 ,        ,    pounds                                 ,    pounds and over                         ii   Multiply the equivalent tax value for the total fleet determined under Subsection  i           by the fraction computed under Subsection     for the apportioned fleet for the registration year.               b   Fees shall be assessed as provided in Section     a     .                    a   Commercial vehicles meeting the registration requirements of another jurisdiction          may, as an alternative to full or apportioned registration, secure a temporary registration permit          for a period not to exceed    hours or until they leave the state, whichever is less, for a fee of              for a single unit and     for multiple units.               b   A state temporary permit or registration fee is not required from nonresident owners          or operators of vehicles or combination of vehicles having a gross laden weight of   ,    pounds                 or less for each single unit or combination.
