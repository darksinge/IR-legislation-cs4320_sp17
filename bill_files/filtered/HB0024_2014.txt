Section   .    Section      A            is amended to read                                     A       .  Preferred provider contract provisions.                                 Health insurance policies may provide for insureds to receive services or                             reimbursement under the policies in accordance with preferred health care provider contracts as                             follows                                       Subject to restrictions under this section,  any  an insurer or third party                                administrator may enter into contracts with health care providers as defined in Section                               B            under which the health care providers agree to supply services, at prices specified in                             the contracts, to persons insured by an insurer.                                  a   i   A health care provider contract may require the health care provider to accept the                             specified payment in this Subsection     as payment in full, relinquishing the right to collect                             additional amounts from the insured person.                                  ii   In  any  a dispute involving a provider s claim for reimbursement, the same shall be                             determined in accordance with applicable law, the provider contract, the subscriber contract,                             and the insurer s written payment policies in effect at the time services were rendered.                                  iii   If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, the matter shall be subject to                             binding arbitration by a jointly selected arbitrator.  Each party is to bear its own expense except                             the cost of the jointly selected arbitrator shall be equally shared.  This Subsection     a  iii                              does not apply to the claim of a general acute hospital to the extent it is inconsistent with the                             hospital s provider agreement.                                  iv   An organization may not penalize a provider solely for pursuing a claims dispute                             or otherwise demanding payment for a sum believed owing.                                  v   If an insurer permits another entity with which it does not share common ownership                             or control to use or otherwise lease one or more of the organization s networks of participating                             providers, the organization shall ensure, at a minimum, that the entity pays participating                             providers in accordance with the same fee schedule and general payment policies as the                             organization would for that network.                                  b   The insurance contract may reward the insured for selection of preferred health care                             providers by                                   i   reducing premium rates

contain the  language required by                             requirements described in Subsection     c  i , the provider may not collect or attempt to                             collect from the
