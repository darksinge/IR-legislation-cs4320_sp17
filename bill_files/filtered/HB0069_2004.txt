A pharmacist shall not dispense a drug in substitution for a drug prescribed by                          brand name if the practitioner has indicated that a substitution is prohibited using one or more                          of the following methods                                 a   by oral communication to the pharmacist  or                                b   by including the handwritten words  Dispense as Written  on a prescription that is                          given to the pharmacist, or in the case of an electronically transmitted prescription, including                          faxed prescriptions, the practitioner expressly indicates to the pharmacist that the brand name                          drug prescribed is medically necessary by indicating  Dispense as Written.
