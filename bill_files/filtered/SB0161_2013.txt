If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from a taxpayer exceeds the tax                            to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.                                     a   Subject to Subsection     b , a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment that                            is attributable to a net operating loss carry back or carry forward shall be filed within three                            years from the due date of the return for the taxable year of the net operating loss.                                 b   The three year period described in Subsection     a  shall be extended by any                            extension of time provided in statute for filing the return described in Subsection     a .                                      If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid under this                            chapter, the amount is an overpayment.                                      If a tax under this chapter is assessed or collected after the expiration of the                            applicable period of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.                                      a   A taxpayer may file a claim for a credit or refund of an overpayment within                            two years from the date a notice of change, notice of correction, or amended return is required                            to be filed with the commission if the taxpayer is required to                                  i   report a change or correction in income reported on the taxpayer s federal income                            tax return                                  ii   report a change or correction that is treated in the same manner as if the change or                            correction were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes  or                                 iii   file an amended return with the commission.                                 b   If a report or amended return is not filed within    days, interest on any resulting                            refund or credit ceases to accrue after the    day period.                                 c   The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in                            tax attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer s amended                            federal income tax return.                                 d   Except as provided in Subsection      a , this Subsection      does not affect the                               amount or the time within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.                                      A credit or refund may not be allowed or made if an overpayment is less than   .                                      In the case of an overpayment of tax by an employer under Part  , Withholding of                            Tax, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the amount of the                            overpayment is not deducted and withheld from wages under this chapter.                                      a   If a taxpayer that is allowed a refund under this chapter dies, the commission                            may make payment to the personal representative of the taxpayer s estate.                                 b   If there is no personal representative of the taxpayer s estate, payment may be made                            to those persons who establish entitlement to inherit the property of the decedent in the                            proportions established in Title   , Utah Uniform Probate Code.                                      If an overpayment relates to a change in net income described in Subsection                                              a , a credit may be allowed or a refund paid any time before the expiration of the                            period within which a deficiency may be assessed.                                      An overpayment of a tax imposed by this chapter shall accrue interest at the rate                            and in the manner prescribed in Section                 .
