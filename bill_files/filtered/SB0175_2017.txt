If a person subject to examination under Section     a      has filed the reportsrequired under Section     a     and Section     a      and has retained the records requiredby Section     a    , the following rules apply  a   the examination shall include a review of the person s records  b   the examination may not be based on an estimate unless the person expresslyconsents in a record to the use of an estimate  and c   the person conducting the examination shall consider the evidence presented ingood faith by the person in preparing the findings of the examination under Section    a     .         a     .Records obtained and records, including work papers, compiled by the administrator inthe course of conducting an examination under Section     a           are subject to the confidentiality and security provisions of Part   , Confidentialityand Security of Information, and are not public records      may be used by the administrator in an action to collect property or otherwiseenforce this chapter      may be used in a joint examination conducted with another state, the United States,a foreign country or subordinate unit of a foreign country, or any other governmental entity ifthe governmental entity conducting the examination is legally bound to maintain theconfidentiality and security of information obtained from a person subject to examination in amanner substantially equivalent to Part   , Confidentiality and Security of Information      shall be disclosed, on request, to the person that administers the unclaimed propertylaw of another state for that state s use in circumstances equivalent to circumstances describedin this part, if the other state is required to maintain the confidentiality and security ofinformation obtained in a manner substantially equivalent to Part   , Confidentiality andSecurity of Information      shall be produced by the administrator under an administrative or judicial subpoenaor administrative or court order  and     shall be produced by the administrator on request of the person subject to theexamination in an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the property.         a     .     A record of a putative holder showing an unpaid debt or undischarged obligation isprima facie evidence of the debt or obligation.     A putative holder may establish by a preponderance of the evidence that there is nounpaid debt or undischarged obligation for a debt or obligation described in Subsection     orthat the debt or obligation was not, or no longer is, a fixed and certain obligation of the putativeholder.     A putative holder may overcome prima facie evidence under Subsection     byestablishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a check, draft, or similar instrument was  a   issued as an unaccepted offer in settlement of an unliquidated amount  b   issued but later was replaced with another instrument because the earlier instrumentwas lost or contained an error that was corrected  c   issued to a party affiliated with the issuer  d   paid, satisfied, or discharged  e   issued in error  f   issued without consideration  g   issued but there was a failure of consideration  h   voided within a reasonable time after issuance for a valid business reason set forthin a contemporaneous record  or i   issued but not delivered to the third party payee for a sufficient reason recordedwithin a reasonable time after issuance.

A payment made based on estimation under this section is a penalty for failure tomaintain the records required by Section     a     and does not relieve a person from anobligation to report and deliver property to a state in which the holder is domiciled.         a     .At the conclusion of an examination under Section     a     , unless waived inwriting by the person being examined, the administrator shall provide to the person whoserecords were examined a report that specifies      the work performed      the property types reviewed      the methodology of any estimation technique, extrapolation, or statistical samplingused in conducting the examination      each calculation showing the value of property determined to be due  and     the findings of the person conducting the examination.         a     .

At a conference under Subsection    , the putative holder shall be given anopportunity to confer informally with the administrator and the person that examined therecords of the putative holder to  a   discuss the determination made under Section     a       and b   present any issue concerning the validity of the determination.     If the administrator fails to act within the period prescribed in Subsection     a  or g , the failure does not affect a right of the administrator, except that interest does not accrueon the amount for which the putative holder was determined to be liable under Section    a      during the period in which the administrator failed to act until the earlier of  a   the date under Section     a      the putative holder initiates administrativereview or files an action under Section     a       or b      days after the putative holder received notice of the administrator sdetermination under Section     a      if no review was initiated under Section     a     and no action was filed under Section     a     .     The administrator may hold an informal conference with a putative holder about adetermination under Section     a      without a request at any time before the putativeholder initiates administrative review under Section     a      or files an action under Section    a     .

Not later than    days after receiving notice of the administrator s determinationunder Section     a     , the putative holder may  a   file an action against the administrator in the district court challenging theadministrator s determination of liability and seeking a declaration that the determination isunenforceable, in whole or in part  or b   pay the amount or deliver the property determined by the administrator to be paidor delivered to the administrator and, not later than six months after payment or delivery, filean action against the administrator in the district court for a refund of all or part of the amountpaid or return of all or part of the property delivered.
