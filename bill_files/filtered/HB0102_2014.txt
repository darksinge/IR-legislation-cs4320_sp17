The failure of an owner of property within the assessment area to appear before the                            board of equalization to object to the levy of the assessment constitutes a waiver of all                            objections to the levy, except an objection that the governing body failed to obtain jurisdiction                            to order that the improvements which the assessment is intended to pay be provided to the                            assessment area.

Assessment requirements.                                     a   Each local entity that levies an assessment under this chapter shall levy the                            assessment on each block, lot, tract, or parcel of property that  borders, is adjacent to, or                             benefits from an improvement                                  i   to the extent that the improvement directly  or indirectly  benefits the property  and                                 ii   to whatever depth on the parcel of property that the governing body determines,                            including the full depth.                                 b   The validity of an otherwise valid assessment is not affected by the fact that the                            benefit to the property from the improvement    does not increase the fair market value of the                           property.                                  i   is only indirect  or                                   ii   does not increase the fair market value of the property.                                       The  Subject to Section                  , the assessment method a governing body uses                            to calculate an assessment may be according to frontage, area, taxable value, fair market value,                            lot, number of connections, equivalent residential unit, or any combination of these methods, as                            the governing body considers fair and equitable.                                     In calculating assessments, a governing body may                                  a   use different methods for different improvements in an assessment area  and                                 b   assess different amounts in different zones, even when using the same method, if                               acquisition or construction costs differ from zone to zone.                                     a   Each local entity shall make an allowance for each corner lot receiving the same                            improvement on both sides so that the property is not assessed at the full rate on both sides.                                 b   A local entity may allocate a corner lot allowance under Subsection     a  to all                            other benefitted property within the assessment area by increasing the assessment levied                            against the other property.                                     a   Assessments shall be fair and equitable according to the benefit to the benefitted                            property from the improvement.                                 b   To comply with Subsection     a , a local entity may levy assessments within                            zones.                                     A local entity may levy an assessment that would otherwise violate a provision of                            this chapter if the owners of all property to be assessed enter into a written agreement with the                            local entity consenting to the assessment.
