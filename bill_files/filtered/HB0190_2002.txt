Section                  is amended to read                                          .  Overpayment of tax    Credits    Refunds.                                       In cases where there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed by this chapter, the                           amount of overpayment is credited as follows                                 a   against any income tax then due from the taxpayer                                 b   against                                 i   the amount of any judgment against the taxpayer, including one ordering the payment                           of a fine or of restitution to a victim under  Section                  Title   , Chapter   a, Crime                          Victims Restitution Act, obtained through due process of law by any entity of state government                            or                                ii  any child support obligation which is due or past due, as determined by the Office of                           Recovery Services in the Department of Human Services and after notice and an opportunity for                           an adjudicative proceeding, as provided in Subsection      or                                c   as bail, to ensure the appearance of the taxpayer before the appropriate authority to                           resolve an outstanding warrant against the taxpayer for which bail is due, if a court of competent                           jurisdiction has not approved an alternative form of payment.  This bail may be applied to any fine                           or forfeiture which is due and related to a warrant which is outstanding on or after February   ,                               , and in accordance with Subsections     and    .                                    a   Subsection     b  ii  may be exercised only if the Office of Recovery Services has                           sent written notice to the taxpayer s last known address or the address on file under Section                              A       .     , stating                                 i   the amount of child support that is due or past due as of the date of the notice or other                           specified date                                 ii   that any overpayment shall be applied to reduce the amount of due or past due child                           support specified in the notice  and                                iii   that the taxpayer may contest the amount of past due child support specified in the                           notice by filing a written request for an adjudicative proceeding with the office within    days of                           the notice being sent.                                b   The Office of Recovery Services shall establish rules to implement this Subsection    ,                           including procedures, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, to ensure prompt                           reimbursement to the taxpayer of any amount of an overpayment of taxes which was credited                           against a child support obligation in error, and to ensure prompt distribution of properly credited                           funds to the obligee parent.                                       Subsection     c  may be exercised only if                                 a   a court has issued a warrant for the arrest of the taxpayer for failure to post bail, appear,                           or otherwise satisfy the terms of a citation, summons, or court order  and                                b   a notice of intent to apply the overpayment as bail on the issued warrant has been sent                           to the person s current address on file with the commission.                                    a   The commission shall deliver the overpayment applied as bail to the court that                           issued the warrant of arrest.  The clerk of the court is authorized to endorse the check or                           commission warrant of payment on behalf of the payees and deposit the monies in the court                           treasury.                                b   The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the                           warrant for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the taxpayer                           is not required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar amount of                           bail.  In all other cases, the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not required to order                           the withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the    day period, and the taxpayer                           may be arrested on the warrant.  However, the bail amount shall be reduced by the amount of tax                           overpayment received by the court.                                c   If the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice described in Subsection    , or to resolve                           the warrant within    days after the notice was sent under that subsection, the overpayment applied                           as bail is forfeited and notice of the forfeiture shall be mailed to the taxpayer at the current address                           on file with the commission.  The court may then issue another warrant or allow the original                           warrant to remain in force if                                 i   the taxpayer has not complied with an order of the court                                 ii   the taxpayer has failed to appear and respond to a criminal charge for which a personal                           appearance is required  or                                iii   the taxpayer has paid partial but not full bail in a case for which a personal appearance                           is not required.                                    If the alleged violations named in the warrant are later resolved in favor of the                           taxpayer, the bail amount shall be remitted to the taxpayer.                                    Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.                                    a   If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld from                           wages exceeds the actual tax due, a refund or credit may not be made or allowed unless the                              taxpayer or his legal representative files with the commission a tax return claiming the refund or                           credit                                 i   within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension of                           time for filing the return provided for in Subsection     c   or                                ii   within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever period is later.                                b  Except as provided in Subsection     d , in other instances where a refund or credit of                           tax which has not been deducted and withheld from income is due, a credit or refund may not be                           allowed or made after three years from the time the tax was paid, unless, before the expiration of                           the period, a claim is filed by the taxpayer or his legal representative.                                c   Beginning on July  ,     , the commission shall extend the period for a taxpayer to                            file a claim under Subsection     a  i  if                                  i   the time period for filing a claim under Subsection     a  has not expired  and                                 ii   the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement                                  A   authorizing the extension  and                                 B   providing for the length of the extension.                                 d   Notwithstanding Subsection     b , beginning on July  ,     , the commission shall                            extend the period for a taxpayer to file a claim under Subsection     b  if                                  i   the three year period under Subsection     b  has not expired  and                                 ii   the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement                                  A   authorizing the extension  and                                 B   providing for the length of the extension.                                     The fine and bail forfeiture provisions of this section apply to all warrants and fines                            issued in cases charging the taxpayer with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction described in                            this section which are outstanding on or after February   ,     .                                     If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the tax                            to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.                                      A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the application                            to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years from the time the                            return was due for the taxable year of the loss.                                      If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and                            withheld under Section                  , a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent that                               the amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.                                      If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax, the                            amount is an overpayment.                                      If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable period                            of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.                                      a   If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable income                            reported on his federal income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is treated in                            the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes, or to file an                            amended return with the commission, a claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment                            of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the date the notice of the change,                            correction, or amended return was required to be filed with the commission.                                 b   If the report or amended return is not filed within    days, interest on any resulting                            refund or credit ceases to accrue after the    day period.                                 c   The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax                            attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer s amended federal                            income tax return.                                 d   Except as specifically provided, this section does not affect the amount or the time                            within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.                                      No credit or refund may be allowed or made if the overpayment is less than   .                                      The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the tax paid during the three years                            immediately preceding the filing of the claim, or if no claim is filed, then during the three years                            immediately preceding the allowance of the credit or refund.                                      In the case of an overpayment of tax by the employer under the withholding                            provisions of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent that                            the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the provisions                            of this chapter.                                      If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under this chapter dies, the commission may                            make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer s estate.  If there is                            no executor or administrator, payment may be made to those persons who establish entitlement to                            inherit the property of the decedent in the proportions set out in Title   , Utah Uniform Probate                            Code.                                         Where an overpayment relates to adjustments to net income referred to in Subsection                                              c , credit may be allowed or a refund paid any time before the expiration of the                            period within which a deficiency may be assessed.                                      An overpayment of a tax imposed by this chapter shall accrue interest at the rate and                            in the manner prescribed in Section                 .                                Section  .    Section         a         is amended to read                                       a    .  Restitution    Reparations not to supplant restitution    Assignment of                            claim for restitution judgment to Reparations Office.                                     A reparations award shall not supplant restitution as established under  Section                                           Title   , Chapter   a, Crime Victims Restitution Act, or as established by any other                            provisions.

of time toward the total probation term unless the probationer is exonerated at a hearing                            to revoke the probation.                                 ii   Any time served in

          probationer is exonerated at the hearing.                                 b   The running of the probation period is tolled upon the filing of a violation report with                            the court alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of probation or upon the issuance of an                            order to show cause or warrant by the court.

               conditions of probation have been violated.                                 b   i   Upon the filing of an affidavit alleging with particularity facts asserted to constitute                            violation of the conditions of probation, the court that authorized probation shall determine if the                            affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or extension of                            probation is justified.                                 ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the                            defendant a warrant for his arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show cause why his                            probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.                                 c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall be                            served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.                                 ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.                                 iii   The order to show cause shall inform the defendant of a right to be represented by                               counsel at the hearing and to have counsel appointed for him if he is indigent.                                 iv   The order shall also inform the defendant of a right to present evidence.                                 d   i   At the hearing, the defendant shall admit or deny the allegations of the affidavit.                                 ii   If the defendant denies the allegations of the affidavit, the prosecuting attorney shall                            present evidence on the allegations.                                 iii   The persons who have given adverse information on which the allegations are based                            shall be presented as witnesses subject to questioning by the defendant unless the court for good                            cause otherwise orders.                                 iv   The defendant may call witnesses, appear and speak in his own behalf, and present                            evidence.                                 e   i   After the hearing the court shall make findings of fact.                                 ii   Upon a finding that the defendant violated the conditions of probation, the court may                            order the probation revoked, modified, continued, or that the entire probation term commence

When a defendant is convicted of criminal activity that has resulted in pecuniary                            damages, in addition to any other sentence it may impose, the court shall order that the defendant                            make restitution to victims of crime as provided in this  subsection  chapter, or for conduct for                               which the defendant has agreed to make restitution as part of a plea disposition.  For purposes of                            restitution, a victim has the meaning as defined in Subsection          a                   and in                            determining whether restitution is appropriate, the court shall follow the criteria and procedures                            as provided in Subsections     through    .                                     In determining restitution, the court shall determine complete restitution and                            court ordered restitution.                                 a    Complete restitution  means restitution necessary to compensate a victim for all losses                            caused by the defendant.                                 b    Court ordered restitution  means the restitution the court having criminal jurisdiction                            orders the defendant to pay as a part of the criminal sentence at the time of sentencing.                                 c   Complete restitution and court ordered restitution shall be determined as provided in                            Subsection    .                                     If the court determines that restitution is appropriate or inappropriate under this part,                            the court shall make the reasons for the decision part of the court record.                                     If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount, or distribution of the restitution, the                            court shall at the time of sentencing allow the defendant a full hearing on the issue.                                     a   For the purpose of determining restitution for an offense, the offense shall include                            any criminal conduct admitted by the defendant to the sentencing court or to which the defendant                            agrees to pay restitution.
