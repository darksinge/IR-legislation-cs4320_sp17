, and ending on the day that the temporary limited                            driver license expires, the suspension described in this Subsection     only applies if the person                            who is suspended operates a motor vehicle for a purpose other than employment, education, or                            child visitation.                                 B   Upon expiration of a temporary limited driver license described in this Subsection                                d                                   I   a suspension described in Subsection     a

person suspended under Subsection     a  may not drive a motor vehicle for any                            reason.                                 iv   The division is not required to issue a limited driver license to a person under this                            Subsection     d  if there are other legal grounds for the suspension of the person s driver                               license.                                 v   The division shall make rules, in accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah                            Administrative Rulemaking Act, to implement the provisions of

that person in another state of an offense committed                            there that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a                            license.                                 b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                            nonresident driver of a motor vehicle or

   state where the person convicted is a resident.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a                            motor vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be                            suspended or revoked.                                 b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when the person s                            license has been suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                                     a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of                            more than one year except                                  i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                                       ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving                           privileges under Section                                                     iii    ii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or                            reports under Subsection                                                       iv    iii   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section                                 a                                            v    iv   when the division suspends the license under Subsection      or                                  vi    v   when the division denies the license under Subsection     .                                 b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until the                            person shows satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                            Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any                               person without hearing and without receiving a record of the person s conviction for a crime                            when the division has reason to believe that the person s license was granted by the division                            through error or fraud or that the necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is                            terminated.                                 b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that                            after the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                      a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is                            incompetent or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified                            by the  division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                 b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                            person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction                            imposed in accordance with Section                 .                                 c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                            suspension or revocation of the licensee s license.                                      a   Except as provided in Subsection      b , a report authorized by Section                                          may not contain any evidence of a conviction for speeding on an interstate system in                            this state if the conviction was for a speed of    miles per hour or less, above the posted speed                            limit and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in a manner specified by the division                            by the individual whose report is being requested.                                 b   The provisions of Subsection      a  do not apply for                                  i   a CDL license holder  or                                 ii   a violation that occurred in a commercial motor vehicle.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                            Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person                            if it has reason to believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is                            required under Title   , Chapter   a, Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Owners and                            Operators Act, and has driven the motor vehicle or permitted it to be driven within this state                            without the security being in effect.                                 b   The division may immediately suspend a driving privilege card holder s driving                            privilege card if the division receives notification from the Motor Vehicle Division that                                  i   the driving privilege card holder is the registered owner of a vehicle  and                                    ii   the driving privilege card holder s vehicle registration has been revoked under                            Subsection        a             a  ii  A .

suspended under this Subsection     .                                 d   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this                            Subsection     , the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.                                 e   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been                            revoked by the division under this Subsection      may file a request for agency action                            requesting a hearing.                                      The division may deny an individual s license if the person fails to comply with                            the requirement to downgrade the person s CDL to a class D license under Section            .      .                                      The division may deny a person s class A, B, C, or D license if the person fails to                            comply with the requirement to have a K restriction removed from the person s license.                                      Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also                            disqualifies any license issued to that person under Part  , Uniform Commercial Driver License                            Act.
