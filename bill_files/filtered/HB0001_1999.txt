Discount germination is a non priority service                       intended for carry over seed which is ideal for checking                       inventories from May through August. The discount                       service is available during the rest of the year, but delays                       in testing may result due to high test volume of priority                       samples.  Ten      or more samples receive    percent                       discount off normal germination fees.
