When practicable, the court may take into consideration the religious preferences of the        minor and of a child s parents.              p   i   In support of a decree under Section   A      , the court may order reasonable        conditions to be complied with by a minor s parents or guardian, a minor, a minor s custodian,        or any other person who has been made a party to the proceedings.

The juvenile court may enter an        order for child support on behalf of the child against the natural or adoptive parents of the        child.              ii   Orders under Subsection     y  i                A   shall remain in effect until the child reaches majority               B   are not subject to review under Section   A        and              C   may be modified by petition or motion as provided in Section   A       .              iii   Orders permanently terminating the rights of a parent, guardian, or custodian and        permanent orders of custody and guardianship do not expire with a termination of jurisdiction        of the juvenile court.                  In addition to the dispositions described in Subsection    , when a minor comes        within the court s jurisdiction, the minor may be given a choice by the court to serve in the        National Guard in lieu of other sanctions, provided               a   the minor meets the current entrance qualifications for service in the National        Guard as determined by a recruiter, whose determination is final               b   the minor is not under the jurisdiction of the court for any act that               i   would be a felony if committed by an adult               ii   is a violation of Title   , Chapter   , Utah Controlled Substances Act  or              iii   was committed with a weapon  and              c   the court retains jurisdiction over the minor under conditions set by the court and        agreed upon by the recruiter or the unit commander to which the minor is eventually assigned.                  a   A DNA specimen shall be obtained from a minor who is under the jurisdiction        of the court as described in Subsection             .
