Section                 is amended to read                                         .  Criminal nonsupport.                                      A person commits criminal nonsupport if, having a spouse, a child, or children under                           the age of    years, he knowingly fails to provide for the support of the spouse, child, or children                           when any one of them                                 a   is in needy circumstances  or                                b   would be in needy circumstances but for support received from a source other than the                          defendant.                                    Except as provided in Subsection    , criminal nonsupport is a class A misdemeanor.                                    Criminal nonsupport is a felony of the third degree if the actor                                 a   has been convicted one or more times of nonsupport, whether in this state, any other                           state, or any court of the United States   or                                 b   committed the offense while residing  in another state  outside of Utah  or                                c   commits the crime of nonsupport in each of six individual months within any    month                             period, or the total arrearage is in excess of    ,   .                                    For purposes of this section  child  includes a child born out of wedlock whose                           paternity has been admitted by the actor or has been established in a civil suit.                                     In a prosecution under this section, it is no defense that the person to be supported                          received necessary support from a source other than the defendant.                                           a  In a prosecution for criminal nonsupport under this section, it is an affirmative                           defense that the accused is unable to provide support.  Voluntary unemployment or                           underemployment by the defendant does not give rise to that defense.                                b  Not less than    days before trial the defendant shall file and serve on the prosecuting                           attorney a notice, in writing, of his intention to claim the affirmative defense of inability to provide                           support.  The notice shall specifically identify the factual basis for the defense and the names and                           addresses of the witnesses who the defendant proposes to examine in order to establish the defense.                                c   Not more than ten days after receipt of the notice described in Subsection     b , or at                           such other time as the court may direct, the prosecuting attorney shall file and serve the defendant                           with a notice containing the names and addresses of the witnesses who the state proposes to                           examine in order to contradict or rebut the defendant s claim.                                d   Failure to comply with the requirements of Subsection     b  or     c  entitles the                           opposing party to a continuance to allow for preparation.  If the court finds that a party s failure to                           comply is the result of bad faith, it may impose appropriate sanctions.
