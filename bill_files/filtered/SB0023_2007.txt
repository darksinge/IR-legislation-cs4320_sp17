Each parent s child support obligation shall be established in proportion to their                            adjusted gross incomes, unless the low income table is applicable.  Except during periods of                            court ordered parent time as set forth in Section            .      , the parents are obligated to pay                            their proportionate shares of the base combined child support obligation.  If physical custody of                            the child changes from that assumed in the original order, modification of the order is not                            necessary, even if only one parent is specifically ordered to pay in the order.                                     Except in cases of joint physical custody and split custody as defined in Section                                         and in cases where the obligor s adjusted gross income is   ,    or less monthly, the                            base child support award shall be determined as follows                                  a   combine the adjusted gross incomes of the parents and determine the base                            combined child support obligation using the base combined child support obligation table  and                                 b   calculate each parent s proportionate share of the base combined child support                            obligation by multiplying the combined child support obligation by each parent s percentage of                            combined adjusted gross income.                                     In the case of an incapacitated adult child, any amount that the incapacitated adult                               child can contribute to  his or her  the incapacitated adult child s support may be considered in                            the determination of child support and may be used to justify a reduction in the amount of                            support ordered, except that in the case of orders involving multiple children, the reduction                            shall not be greater than the effect of reducing the total number of children by one in the child                            support table calculation.

If the income and number of children is found in an area of the low income table in                            which no amount is shown, the base combined child support obligation table is to be used.                                     The base combined child support obligation table provides combined child support                            obligations for up to six children.  For more than six children, additional amounts may be                            added to the base child support obligation shown.  Unless rebutted by Subsection            .        ,                            the amount ordered shall not be less than the amount which would be ordered for up to six                            children.                                     If the monthly adjusted gross income of  the obligor  either parent is      or less,                            the tribunal shall determine the amount of the child support obligation on a case by case basis,                            but the base child support award  shall  may not be less than          .                                     The amount shown on the table is the support amount for the total number of                            children, not an amount per child.                                     For all worksheets, income and support award figures shall be rounded to the                           nearest dollar.                                Section  .

The court shall order that insurance for the medical expenses of the minor children                            be provided by a parent if it is available at a reasonable cost.                                     In determining which parent shall be ordered to maintain insurance for medical                            expenses, the court or administrative agency may consider the                                  a   reasonableness of the cost                                  b   availability of a group insurance policy                                  c   coverage of the policy  and                                 d   preference of the custodial parent.                                     The order shall require each parent to share equally the out of pocket costs of the                            premium actually paid by a parent for the children s portion of insurance.                                     The parent who provides the insurance coverage may receive credit against the base                            child support award or recover the other parent s share of the children s portion of the premium.                             In cases in which the parent does not have insurance but another member of the parent s                            household provides insurance coverage for the children, the parent may receive credit against                            the base child support award or recover the other parent s share of the children s portion of the                            premium.
