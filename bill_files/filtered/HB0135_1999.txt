The third party verification shall occur in the same language as that in which the                           change was solicited.                                     The verification requirements described in this section shall apply to all changes in the                           provider of any public telecommunications service.

Any bill shall identify each telecommunications service provider of                           telecommunication service for which billing is rendered.                                      a   Any person or provider of telecommunications service inadvertently or knowingly                           designating or changing the subscriber s telecommunications service provider in violation of this                           section shall refund to the subscriber any amounts required by the rules of the Federal                           Communications Commission and the commission.                                 b   The unauthorized provider in Subsection      a  additionally shall                                  i   bear all costs of restoring the customer to the service of the subscriber s original service                           provider  and                                 ii   pay to any other telecommunications provider any fees set by the commission for the                           designation or change.                                      Proceedings for violations of this section may be commenced by request for agency                           action filed with the commission by a subscriber, a telecommunications corporation, the Division                           of Public Utilities, or by the commission on its own motion.                                      Any telecommunications corporation, its agents, or a third party verifier who violates                           this section or rules adopted to implement this section shall be subject to the provisions of Sections                                          through                .
