Unless notice has already been given under this section, a trustee for an inter vivos                          trust, upon the death of the grantor, shall publish a notice to creditors once a week for three                          successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the trust property                          resides and in the county where the grantor resided, providing the trustee s name and address and                          notifying creditors of the estate to present their claims within three months after the date of the first                          publication of the notice or be forever barred.                                    A trustee may give written notice by mail or other delivery to any known creditor,                             notifying the creditor to present his claim within    days from the published notice if given as                          provided in Subsection     or within    days from the mailing or other delivery of the notice,                          whichever is later, or be forever barred.  Written notice shall be the notice described in Subsection                              or a similar notice.                                    The trustee shall not be liable to any creditor or to any successor of the decedent for                          giving or failing to give notice under this section.                               Section  .    Section                 is enacted to read                                        .    Limitations on presentation of claims.                                    All claims against a decedent s estate which arose before the death of the decedent,                          including claims of the state and any subdivision of it, whether due or to become due, absolute or                          contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort, or other legal basis, if not barred                          earlier by other statute of limitations, are barred against the estate, the trustee, and the heirs and                          devisees of the decedent, unless presented within the time provided by Section                  for                          creditors who are given actual notice, and where notice is published, within the time provided in                          Section                  for all claims barred by publication.                                    In all events, claims barred by the nonclaim statute at the decedent s domicile are also                          barred in this state.                                    All claims against a decedent s estate which arise at or after the death of the decedent,                          including claims of the state and any of its subdivisions, whether due or to become due, absolute                          or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort, or other legal basis are barred                          against the estate, the trustee, and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented as                          follows                                 a   a claim based on a contract with the trustee within three months after performance by                          the personal representative is due  or                                b   any other claim within the later of three months after it arises, or the time specified in                          Subsection    .                                    Nothing in this section affects or prevents                                 a   any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon property of the                          estate                                 b   to the limits of the insurance protection only, any proceeding to establish liability of                          the decedent or the trustee for which he is protected by liability insurance  or                                   c   collection of compensation for services rendered and reimbursement for expenses                          advanced by the trustee or by the attorney or accountant for the trustee of the estate.                               Section  .    Section                 is enacted to read                                        .  Manner of presentation of claims.                                    Claims against a decedent s estate or inter vivos trust may be presented as follows                                 a   The claimant may deliver or mail to the trustee, or the trustee s attorney of record, a                          written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the                          amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with                          the clerk of the court.  The claim is considered presented on either the receipt of the written                          statement of claim by the trustee or the trustee s attorney of record, or the filing of the claim with                          the court, whichever occurs first.  If a claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall                          be stated.  If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty shall be stated.                           If the claim is secured, the security shall be described.  Failure to describe correctly the security,                          the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the                          presentation made.                                b   The claimant may commence a proceeding against the trustee in any court where the                          trustee may be subjected to jurisdiction to obtain payment of the claim against the estate, but the                          commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim.  No                          presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent                          which were pending at the time of the decedent s death.                                    If a claim is presented under Subsection     a , no proceeding thereon may be                          commenced more than    days after the trustee has mailed a notice of disallowance  but, in the                          case of a claim which is not presently due or which is contingent or unliquidated, the trustee may                          consent to an extension of the    day period, or to avoid injustice, the court, on petition, may order                          an extension of the    day period, but in no event may the extension run beyond the applicable                          statute of limitations.                               Section  .    Section                 is enacted to read                                        .  Classification of claims.                                    If the applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all claims in full, the trustee                          shall make payment in the following order                                 a   reasonable funeral expenses                                    b   costs and expenses of administration                                 c   debts and taxes with preference under federal law                                 d   reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the                          decedent, including compensation of persons attending him, and medical assistance if Section                                     .      applies                                 e   debts and taxes with preference under other laws of this state  and                                f   all other claims.                                    No preference shall be given in the payment of any claim over any other claim of the                          same class, and a claim due and payable shall not be entitled to a preference over claims not due.                               Section  .    Section                 is enacted to read                                         .  Allowance of claims.                                     As to claims presented in the manner described in Section                  and within the                           time limit prescribed in Section                 , the trustee may mail a notice to any claimant stating that                           the claim has been allowed or disallowed.  If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the trustee                           changes the decision concerning the claim, the trustee shall notify the claimant.  The trustee may                           not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance                           or to commence a proceeding on the claim has expired and the claim has been barred.  If the notice                           of disallowance warns the claimant of the impending bar, a claim which is disallowed in whole                           or in part by the trustee is barred so far as not allowed, unless the claimant seeks a court ordered                           allowance by filing a petition for allowance in the court or by commencing a proceeding against                           the trustee not later than    days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial                           allowance.  If the trustee fails to mail notice to a claimant of action on the claim within    days                           after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired, this failure has the effect of a                           notice of allowance.                                     Upon the petition of the trustee or a claimant in a proceeding for this purpose, the court                           may order any claim presented to the trustee or filed with the clerk of the court in a timely manner                           and not barred by Subsection     to be allowed in whole or in part.  Notice of this proceeding shall                           be given to the claimant, the trustee, and those other persons interested in the estate as the court                           may direct by order at the time the proceeding is commenced.                                     A judgment in a proceeding in another court against a trustee to enforce a claim against                           a decedent s estate is a court ordered allowance of the claim.                                        Unless otherwise provided in any judgment in another court entered against the trustee,                           allowed claims bear interest at the legal rate for the period commencing six months after the                           decedent s date of death unless based on a contract making a provision for interest, in which case                           they bear interest in accordance with that provision.                                Section  .    Section                 is enacted to read                                         .  Individual liability of trustee.                                     Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a trustee is not individually liable on a                           contract properly entered into in his fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the estate                           unless he fails to reveal his trustee capacity and identify the trust in the contract.                                     A trustee is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of the                           estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the estate only if he is personally                           at fault.                                     Claims based on contracts entered into by a trustee in his fiduciary capacity, on                           obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate, or on torts committed in the course of                           estate administration may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against the trustee in his                           fiduciary capacity, whether or not the trustee is individually liable therefor.                                     Issues of liability as between the estate and the trustee individually may be determined                           in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, or indemnification or other appropriate proceeding.
