The administrative law judge                            shall dismiss without prejudice the claim for benefits of an employee if the administrative law                            judge finds that the employee fails to fully cooperate, unless the administrative law judge states                            specific findings on the record justifying dismissal with prejudice.                                      a   The loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of both hands, both arms, both                            feet, both legs, both eyes, or any combination of two such body members constitutes total and                            permanent disability, to be compensated according to this section.                                 b   A finding of permanent total disability pursuant to Subsection      a  is final.                                      a   An insurer or self insured employer may periodically reexamine a permanent total                            disability claim, except those based on Subsection     , for which the insurer or self insured                            employer had or has payment responsibility to determine whether the worker remains permanently                            totally disabled.                                 b   Reexamination may be conducted no more than once every three years after an award                            is final, unless good cause is shown by the employer or its insurance carrier to allow more frequent                            reexaminations.                                 c   The reexamination may include                                  i   the review of medical records                                  ii   employee submission to reasonable medical evaluations                                  iii   employee submission to reasonable rehabilitation evaluations and retraining efforts                                  iv   employee disclosure of Federal Income Tax Returns                                  v   employee certification of compliance with Section       A            and                                    vi   employee completion of sworn affidavits or questionnaires approved by the division.                                 d   The insurer or self insured employer shall pay for the cost of a reexamination with                            appropriate employee reimbursement pursuant to rule for reasonable travel allowance and per diem                            as well as reasonable expert witness fees incurred by the employee in supporting the employee s                            claim for permanent total disability benefits at the time of reexamination.                                 e   If an employee fails to fully cooperate in the reasonable reexamination of a permanent                            total disability finding, an administrative law judge may order the suspension of the employee s                            permanent total disability benefits until the employee cooperates with the reexamination.                                 f   i   Should the reexamination of a permanent total disability finding reveal evidence that                            reasonably raises the issue of an employee s continued entitlement to permanent total disability                            compensation benefits, an insurer or self insured employer may petition the Division of                            Adjudication for a rehearing on that issue.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter or Chapter  , Workers                            Compensation Act, for a claim for compensation under this chapter that meets the requirements                           of Subsection    , there is a rebuttable presumption that a presumptive occupational disease                                  a   arose out of and in the course of line of duty employment  and                                 b   is medically caused or aggravated by the line of duty employment described in                           Subsection     a .                                     The presumption described in Subsection     is created if                                  a   the claim for compensation under this chapter is filed within the time periods provided                           in Sections       A           and       A                                            b   the fire department employee for which the claim is filed is employed in the                           line of duty employment                                  i   for at least    months  and                                 ii   A   at the time the claim for compensation is filed  or                                 B   within no more than three years before the claim for compensation is filed                                  c   i   as a condition of being employed in line of duty employment, the fire department                           employee passed a physical examination before  the fire department employee made a claim under                           this chapter for a presumptive occupational disease  and                                 ii   the examination described in Subsection     c  i  did not indicate evidence of a                           presumptive occupational disease  and                                 d   the claim for compensation under this chapter is for a presumptive occupational                              disease.                                     The presumption described in Subsection     may be rebutted if the employer or the                           employer s insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the presumptive                           occupational disease                                  a   did not arise out of and in the course of the line of duty employment  and                                 b   was not medically caused or aggravated by the line of duty employment described in                           Subsection     a .                                     Notwithstanding Subsection    , an employer is not liable for a presumptive                           occupational disease if after a fire department employee is no longer employed in the line of duty                           employment, the fire department employee is injuriously exposed to the hazards of the presumptive                           occupational disease as provided in Section       A          .                                     Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, Title   , Chapter  a, Disease                           Testing and Workers  Compensation Presumption for Benefit of Emergency Medical Services                           Providers, governs whether there is or is not a presumption that a disease, as defined in Section                                  a      , is compensable under this chapter or Chapter  , Workers  Compensation Act.                                     This section may not be construed as preventing a fire department employee from                           receiving workers  compensation benefits under this chapter or Chapter  , Workers  Compensation                           Act, because the fire department employee fails to meet the requirements under this section to                           establish the rebuttable presumption described in Subsection    .        Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM      This bill creates a class consisting of certain firefighters and medical providers of fire departments.   For this class the bill provides a rebuttable presumption that certain diseases presumptively arose  as a result of working for the fire department and therefore are compensable under workers   compensation statutes. Under equal protection principles of the Constitution of the United States  and the uniform operation of the laws provisions of the Utah Constitution, there are limits on a  legislature s ability to establish classifications and then treat members of the classes differently.   In addition, because of the exclusive remedy element of workers  compensation, the open courts  provision of the Utah Constitution may be implicated if the remedies provided under workers   compensation are found inadequate.  In examining the permissibility of classes, courts look to  factors such as the relationship between the class and the legislative objective being pursued.  For  example, a court may look at the relationship between the creation of the presumption and the level  of exposure fire department employees may experience because of the nature of their employment.
