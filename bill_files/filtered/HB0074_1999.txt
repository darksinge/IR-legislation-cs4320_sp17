Section                 is amended to read                                         .  Comparative negligence.                                      The fault of a person seeking recovery shall not alone bar recovery by that person.                                    A person seeking recovery may recover from any defendant or group of defendants                           whose fault, combined with the fault of persons immune from suit, exceeds the fault of the person                           seeking recovery prior to any reallocation of fault made under Subsection                    .                                    No defendant is liable to any person seeking recovery for any amount in excess of the                           proportion of fault attributed to that defendant under Section                 .                                    a   In determining the proportionate fault attributable to each defendant, the fact finder                           may, and when requested by a party shall, consider the conduct of any person who contributed to                           the alleged injury regardless of whether the person is a person immune from suit or a defendant                           in the action and may allocate fault to each person seeking recovery, to each defendant, and to any                          other person, including a person immune from suit who contributed to the alleged injury.                                b   Any fault allocated to a person immune from suit is considered only to accurately                              determine the fault of the person seeking recovery and a defendant and may not subject the person                           immune from suit to any liability, based on the allocation of fault, in this or any other action.                                Section  .    Section                 is amended to read                                         .  Separate special verdicts on total damages and proportion of fault.                                      The trial court may, and when requested by any party shall, direct the jury, if any, to                           find separate special verdicts determining the total amount of damages sustained and the                           percentage or proportion of fault attributable to each person seeking recovery, to each defendant,                           and to any other person, including a person immune from suit who contributed to the alleged                           injury.                                    a   If the combined percentage or proportion of fault attributed to all persons immune                           from suit is less than    , the trial court shall reduce that percentage or proportion of fault to zero                           and reallocate that percentage or proportion of fault to the other parties in proportion to the                           percentage or proportion of fault initially attributed to each party by the fact finder.  After this                           reallocation, cumulative fault shall equal      with the persons immune from suit being allocated                           no fault.                                b   If the combined percentage or proportion of fault attributed to all persons immune from                           suit is     or more, that percentage or proportion of fault attributed to persons immune from suit                           may not be reduced under Subsection     a .                                c   i   The jury may not be advised of the effect of any reallocation under Subsection    .                                ii   The jury may be advised that fault attributed to persons immune from suit may reduce                           the award of the person seeking recovery.                                    A person immune from suit may not be held liable, based on the allocation of fault, in                           this or any other action.                                Section  .
