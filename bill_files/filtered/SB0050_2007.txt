               constitute violation of the conditions of probation, the court that authorized probation shall                            determine if the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or                            extension of probation is justified.                                 ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the                            defendant a warrant for his arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show cause why his                            probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.                                 c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall                            be served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.                                 ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.                                 iii   The order to show cause shall inform the defendant of a right to be represented by                            counsel at the hearing and to have counsel appointed for him if he is indigent.
