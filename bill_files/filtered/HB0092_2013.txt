Petition for determination of factual innocence    Sufficient                           allegations    Notification of victim.                                    A person who has been convicted of a felony offense may petition the district court                           in the county in which the person was convicted for a hearing to establish that the person is                           factually innocent of the crime or crimes of which the person was convicted.                                    a   The petition shall contain an assertion of factual innocence under oath by the                           petitioner ,  and shall aver, with supporting affidavits or other credible documents, that                                 i   newly discovered material evidence exists that, if credible, establishes that the                           petitioner is factually innocent                                 ii  the specific evidence identified by the petitioner in the petition establishes                           innocence                                 iii   the material evidence is not merely cumulative of evidence that was known                                 iv   the material evidence is not merely impeachment evidence  and                                v   viewed with all the other evidence, the newly discovered evidence demonstrates                           that the petitioner is factually innocent.                                b   The court shall review the petition in accordance with the procedures in Subsection                               b , and make a finding that the petition has satisfied the requirements of Subsection     a .                            If the court finds the petition does not meet all the requirements of Subsection     a , it shall                           dismiss the petition without prejudice and send notice of the dismissal to the petitioner and the                           attorney general.                                    a   The petition shall also contain an averment that                                 i   neither the petitioner nor the  petitioner s counsel knew of the evidence at the time                           of trial or sentencing or in time to include the evidence in any previously filed post trial motion                           or postconviction motion, and the evidence could not have been discovered by the petitioner or                           the petitioner s counsel through the exercise of reasonable diligence  or                                ii   a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to exercise reasonable                           diligence in uncovering the evidence.                                b   Upon entry of a finding that the petition is sufficient under Subsection     a , the                           court shall then review the petition to determine if Subsection     a  has been satisfied.  If the                           court finds that the requirements of Subsection     a  have not been satisfied, it may dismiss                           the petition without prejudice and give notice to the petitioner and the attorney general of the                              dismissal, or the court may waive the requirements of Subsection     a  if the court finds the                           petition should proceed to hearing based upon the strength of the petition, and that there is                           other evidence that could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence by                          the petitioner or the petitioner s counsel at trial, and the other evidence                                 i   was not discovered by the petitioner or the petitioner s counsel                                 ii   is material upon the issue of factual innocence  and                                iii   has never been presented to a court.                                    If the conviction for which the petitioner asserts factual innocence was based upon                           a plea of guilty, the petition shall contain the specific nature and content of the evidence that                           establishes factual innocence.  The court shall review the evidence and may dismiss the petition                           at any time in the course of the proceedings, if the court finds that the evidence of factual                           innocence relies solely upon the recantation of testimony or prior statements made by a witness                           against the petitioner, and the recantation appears to the court to be equivocal or selfserving.                                    A person who has already obtained postconviction relief that vacated or reversed                           the person s conviction or sentence may also file a petition under this part in the same manner                           and form as described above, if no retrial or appeal regarding this offense is pending.                                    If some or all of the evidence alleged to be exonerating is biological evidence                           subject to DNA testing, the petitioner shall seek DNA testing pursuant to Section       B          .                                    Except as provided in Subsection    , the petition and all subsequent proceedings                           shall be in compliance with and governed by Rule   C, Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, and                           shall include the underlying criminal case number.                                    After a petition is filed under this section, prosecutors, law enforcement officers,                           and crime laboratory personnel shall cooperate in preserving evidence and in determining the                           sufficiency of the chain of custody of the evidence which is the subject of the petition.                                    a   A person who files a petition under this section shall serve notice of the petition                           and a copy of the petition upon the office of the prosecutor who obtained the conviction and                           upon the Utah attorney general.                                b   The assigned judge shall conduct an initial review of the petition.  If it is apparent                           to the court that the petitioner is either merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence presented in                           previous proceedings or presenting issues that appear frivolous or speculative on their face, the                           court shall dismiss the petition, state the basis for the dismissal, and serve notice of dismissal                              upon the petitioner and the attorney general.  If, upon completion of the initial review, the court                           does not dismiss the petition, it shall order the attorney general to file a response to the petition.                            The attorney general shall, within    days after receipt of the court s order, or within any                           additional period of time the court allows, answer or otherwise respond to all proceedings                           initiated under this part.                                c   After the time for response by the attorney general under Subsection     b  has                           passed, the court shall order a hearing if it finds the petition meets the requirements of                           Subsections     and     and finds there is a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence                           regarding the charges of which the petitioner was convicted.  No bona fide and compelling                           issue of factual innocence exists if the petitioner is merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence                            presented in a previous proceeding or if the petitioner is unable to identify with sufficient                            specificity the nature and reliability of the newly discovered evidence that establishes the                            petitioner s factual innocence.                                 d   If the parties stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually                            innocent, the court may find the petitioner is factually innocent without holding a hearing.  If                            the state will not stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually innocent,                            no determination of factual innocence may be made by the court without first holding a hearing                            under this part.                                      The court may not grant a petition for a hearing under this part during the period                            in which criminal proceedings in the matter are pending before any trial or appellate court,                            unless stipulated to by the parties.                                      Any victim of a crime that is the subject of a petition under this part, and who has                            elected to receive notice under Section                , shall be notified by the state s attorney of any                            hearing regarding the petition.                                      A petition to determine factual innocence under this part, or Part  , Postconviction                             Testing of DNA, shall be filed separately from any petition for postconviction relief under Part                             , General Provisions.  Separate petitions may be filed simultaneously in the same court.                                      The procedures governing the filing and adjudication of a petition to determine                            factual innocence apply to all petitions currently filed or pending in the district court and any                            new petitions filed on or after June  ,     .                                      a   As used in this Subsection     ,  spouse  means the legal relationship                                     i   established between a man and a woman as recognized by the laws of this state  and                                 ii   existing at the time of the petitioner s death.                                 b   A claim for determination of factual innocence under this part is not extinguished                            upon the death of the petitioner.   The assistance payment provisions of Section       B                                    may not apply, and financial payments may not be made, if                                  c   If any payments are already being made to the petitioner under this part at the time                           of the death of the petitioner, or if the finding of factual innocence occurs after the death of the                            petitioner .  In addition, any payments already being made under Section       B           shall cease                           upon the death of the petitioner. , the payments due under Section       B           shall be paid                           according to the schedule under Section       B           to the petitioner s surviving spouse.                           Payments cease upon the death of the spouse.                                      The spouse under Subsection      forfeits all rights to receive any payment under                           this part if the spouse is charged with a homicide established by a preponderance of the                           evidence that meets the elements of any felony homicide offense in Title   , Chapter  ,                           Offenses Against the Person, except automobile homicide, applying the same principles of                           culpability and defenses as in Title   , Utah Criminal Code, including Title   , Chapter  ,                           Principles of Criminal Responsibility.
