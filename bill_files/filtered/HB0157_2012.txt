item                                  I   sold by a seller that is not a related seller  and                                  II   on the same terms as the return of an item sold by that seller to which the related                             seller is related.                                      a   Except as provided in Section              .     , a tax under this chapter shall be                             collected from a purchaser.                                  b   A seller may not collect as tax an amount, without regard to fractional parts of one                             cent, in excess of the tax computed at the rates prescribed by this chapter.                                  c   i   Each seller shall                                   A   give the purchaser a receipt for the tax collected  or                                  B   bill the tax as a separate item and declare the name of this state and the seller s                             sales and use tax license number on the invoice for the sale.                                  ii   The receipt or invoice is prima facie evidence that the seller has collected the tax                             and relieves the purchaser of the liability for reporting the tax to the commission as a                             consumer.                                  d   A seller is not required to maintain a separate account for the tax collected, but is                             considered to be a person charged with receipt, safekeeping, and transfer of public money.                                  e   Taxes collected by a seller pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the                             benefit of the state and for payment to the commission in the manner and at the time provided                             for in this chapter.                                  f   If any seller, during any reporting period, collects as a tax an amount in excess of                             the lawful state and local percentage of total taxable sales allowed under this chapter, the seller                                shall remit to the commission the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter, plus any                             excess.                                  g   If the accounting methods regularly employed by the seller in the transaction of the                             seller s business are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month or quarterly period                             will impose unnecessary hardships, the commission may accept reports at intervals that will, in                             the commission s opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer or seller and will not                             jeopardize collection of the tax.                                  h   i   For a purchase paid with specie legal tender as defined in Section              .     ,                            if the commission requires a seller to remit a tax under this chapter in legal tender other than                            specie legal tender, the seller shall state on the seller s books and records and

tender the seller is                            required to remit to the commission                                   B   subject to Subsection     h  ii , the amount of tax due under this chapter in specie                            legal tender and in the legal tender the seller is required to remit to the commission                                   C   the tax rate under this chapter applicable to the purchase  and                                  D   the date of the purchase.                                  ii   A   Subject to Subsection     h  ii  B , for purposes of
