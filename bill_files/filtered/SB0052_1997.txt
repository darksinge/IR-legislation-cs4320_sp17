A liability insurance policy covering personal watercraft may              a   provide for the prorating of the insurance under that policy with other valid and        collectible insurance              b   grant any lawful coverage in addition to the required personal watercraft liability        coverage              c   if the policy is issued to a person other than a personal watercraft business, limit the        coverage afforded to a personal watercraft business or its officers, agents, or employees to the        minimum limits under Section   A        , and to those instances when there is no other valid and        collectible insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or        contingent  and             d   if issued to a personal watercraft business, restrict coverage afforded to anyone other than        the personal watercraft business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits under        Section   A        , and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible insurance        with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or contingent.                 Personal watercraft liability coverage need not insure any liability                      a   under any workers  compensation law under Title    or   A              b   resulting from bodily injury to or death of an employee of the named insured, other than        a domestic employee, while engaged in the employment of the insured, or while engaged in the        operation, maintenance, or repair of a designated personal watercraft  or             c   resulting from damage to property owned by, rented to, bailed to, or transported by the        insured.                 An insurance carrier providing personal watercraft liability coverage has the right to        settle any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of the        settlement is deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section   A        .                 A policy containing personal watercraft liability coverage imposes on the insurer the duty        to defend, in good faith, any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit seeking        damages which would be payable under the policy.                 a   If a policy containing personal watercraft liability coverage provides an insurer with        the defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured, that defense is not effective against a        third person making a claim against the insurer, unless there was collusion between the third person        and the insured.             b   If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant, after payment,        the insurer is subrogated to the injured person s claim against the insured to the extent of the payment        and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has been made whole        with respect to the claim against the insured.                 A policy of personal watercraft liability coverage may specifically exclude from        coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured s household, including a person who        usually makes his or her home in the same household but temporarily lives elsewhere, if each person        excluded from coverage satisfies the owner s or operator s security requirement of Section             c    , independently of the named insured s proof of owner s or operator s security.
