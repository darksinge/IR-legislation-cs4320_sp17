inability of a peace officer to arrange for any specific chemical test is                            not a defense to taking a test requested by a peace officer, and it is not a defense in any                            criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding resulting from a person s refusal to submit to the                               requested test or tests.                                     a   A peace officer requesting a test or tests shall warn a person that refusal to                            submit to the test or tests may result in revocation of the person s license to operate a motor                            vehicle  and , a five or ten year prohibition of  the person  driving with any measurable or                            detectable amount of alcohol in the

person                                  i   has been placed under arrest                                  ii   has then been requested by a peace officer to submit to any one or more of the                            chemical tests under Subsection      and                                 iii   refuses to submit to any chemical test requested.                                 b   i   Following the warning under Subsection     a , if the person does not                            immediately request that the chemical test or tests as offered by a peace officer be                            administered, a peace officer shall, on behalf of the Driver License Division and within                               hours of the arrest, give notice of the Driver License Division s intention to revoke the person s                            privilege or license to operate a motor vehicle.                                 ii   When a peace officer gives the notice on behalf of the Driver License Division, the                            peace officer shall                                  A   take the Utah license certificate or permit, if any, of the operator

manner specified by the Driver License Division, basic                            information regarding how to obtain a hearing before the Driver License Division.                                 c   A citation issued by a peace officer may, if provided in a manner specified by the                            Driver License Division, also serve as the temporary license certificate.                                 d   As a matter of procedure, the peace officer shall submit a signed report, within ten                            calendar days after the day on which notice is provided under Subsection     b , that                                  i   the peace officer had grounds to believe the arrested person was in violation of any                               provision under

Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the test or tests shall                            be made available to the person.                                     a   The person to be tested may, at the person s own expense, have a physician of                            the person s own choice administer a chemical test in addition to the test or tests administered                            at the direction of a peace officer.                                 b   The failure or inability to obtain the additional test does not affect admissibility of                            the results of the test or tests taken at the direction of a peace officer, or preclude or delay the                            test or tests to be taken at the direction of a peace officer.                                 c   The additional test shall be subsequent to the test or tests administered at the                            direction of a peace officer.                                     For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the                            person to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician,                            or other person present as a condition for the taking of any test.
