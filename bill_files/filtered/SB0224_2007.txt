In cases where there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed by this chapter,                           the amount of overpayment is credited as follows                                 a   against any income tax then due from the taxpayer                                 b   against                                 i   the amount of any judgment against the taxpayer, including one ordering the                           payment of a fine or of restitution to a victim under Title   , Chapter   a, Crime Victims                           Restitution Act, obtained through due process of law by any entity of state government  or                                ii  any child support obligation which is due or past due, as determined by the Office                           of Recovery Services in the Department of Human Services and after notice and an opportunity                           for an adjudicative proceeding, as provided in Subsection      or                                c   as bail, to ensure the appearance of the taxpayer before the appropriate authority to                              resolve an outstanding warrant against the taxpayer for which bail is due, if a court of                           competent jurisdiction has not approved an alternative form of payment.  This bail may be                           applied to any fine or forfeiture which is due and related to a warrant which is outstanding on                           or after February   ,     , and in accordance with Subsections     and    .                                    a   Subsection     b  ii  may be exercised only if the Office of Recovery Services                           has sent written notice to the taxpayer s last known address or the address on file under Section                              A       .     , stating                                 i   the amount of child support that is due or past due as of the date of the notice or                           other specified date                                 ii   that any overpayment shall be applied to reduce the amount of due or past due child                           support specified in the notice  and                                iii   that the taxpayer may contest the amount of past due child support specified in the                           notice by filing a written request for an adjudicative proceeding with the office within    days                           of the notice being sent.                                b   The Office of Recovery Services shall establish rules to implement this Subsection                              , including procedures, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, to ensure                           prompt reimbursement to the taxpayer of any amount of an overpayment of taxes which was                           credited against a child support obligation in error, and to ensure prompt distribution of                           properly credited funds to the obligee parent.                                    Subsection     c  may be exercised only if                                 a   a court has issued a warrant for the arrest of the taxpayer for failure to post bail,                           appear, or otherwise satisfy the terms of a citation, summons, or court order  and                                b   a notice of intent to apply the overpayment as bail on the issued warrant has been                           sent to the person s current address on file with the commission.                                    a   The commission shall deliver the overpayment applied as bail to the court that                           issued the warrant of arrest.  The clerk of the court is authorized to endorse the check or                           commission warrant of payment on behalf of the payees and deposit the monies in the court                           treasury.                                   b   The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the                           warrant for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the                           taxpayer is not required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar                           amount of bail.  In all other cases, the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not                           required to order the withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the    day                           period, and the taxpayer may be arrested on the warrant.   However, the bail amount shall be                          reduced by the amount of tax overpayment received by the court.                                 c   If the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice described in Subsection    , or to                           resolve the warrant within    days after the notice was sent under that Subsection, the                           overpayment applied as bail is forfeited and notice of the forfeiture shall be mailed to the                           taxpayer at the current address on file with the commission.  The court may then issue another                           warrant or allow the original warrant to remain in force if                                 i   the taxpayer has not complied with an order of the court                                 ii   the taxpayer has failed to appear and respond to a criminal charge for which a                            personal appearance is required  or                                 iii   the taxpayer has paid partial but not full bail in a case for which a personal                            appearance is not required.                                     If the alleged violations named in the warrant are later resolved in favor of the                            taxpayer, the bail amount shall be remitted to the taxpayer.                                     Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.                                     a   If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld                            from wages exceeds the actual tax due, a refund or credit may not be made or allowed unless                            the taxpayer or his legal representative files with the commission a tax return claiming the                            refund or credit                                  i   within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension                            of time for filing the return provided for in Subsection     c   or                                 ii   within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever period is later.                                 b  Except as provided in Subsection     d , in other instances where a refund or credit                               of tax which has not been deducted and withheld from income is due, a credit or refund may                            not be allowed or made after three years from the time the tax was paid, unless, before the                            expiration of the period, a claim is filed by the taxpayer or his legal representative.                                 c   Beginning on July  ,     , the commission shall extend the period for a taxpayer to                            file a claim under Subsection     a  i  if                                  i   the time period for filing a claim under Subsection     a  has not expired  and                                 ii   the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement                                  A   authorizing the extension  and                                 B   providing for the length of the extension.                                 d   Notwithstanding Subsection     b , beginning on July  ,     , the commission                            shall extend the period for a taxpayer to file a claim under Subsection     b  if                                  i   the three year period under Subsection     b  has not expired  and                                 ii   the commission and the taxpayer sign a written agreement                                  A   authorizing the extension  and                                 B   providing for the length of the extension.                                     The fine and bail forfeiture provisions of this section apply to all warrants and fines                            issued in cases charging the taxpayer with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction described                            in this section which are outstanding on or after February   ,     .                                     If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the                            tax to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.                                      A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the                            application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years                            from the time the return was due for the taxable year of the loss.                                      If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and                            withheld under Section                  , a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent                            that the amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.                                      If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax,                            the amount is an overpayment.                                         If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable                            period of limitation, that amount is an overpayment.                                      a   If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable                            income reported on his federal income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is                            treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes, or to                            file an amended return with the commission, a claim for credit or refund of any resulting                            overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the date the notice of                            the change, correction, or amended return was required to be filed with the commission.                                 b   If the report or amended return is not filed within    days, interest on any resulting                            refund or credit ceases to accrue after the    day period.                                 c   The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in                            tax attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer s amended                            federal income tax return.                                 d   Except as specifically provided, this section does not affect the amount or the time                            within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.                                      No credit or refund may be allowed or made if the overpayment is less than   .                                      The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the tax paid during the three                            years immediately preceding the filing of the claim, or if no claim is filed, then during the three                            years immediately preceding the allowance of the credit or refund.
