If only one vendor meets the minimum qualifications, evaluation criteria, and         applicable score thresholds set forth in the request for statement of qualifications that the         procurement unit is using as part of an approved vendor list process, the conducting         procurement unit                a   shall cancel the request for statement of qualifications  and               b   may not establish an approved vendor list based on the canceled request for         statement of qualifications or on statements of qualifications submitted in response to the         request for statement of qualifications.                    If a conducting procurement unit cancels a request for statement of qualifications,         the conducting procurement unit shall make available for public inspection a written         justification for the cancellation.                    After receiving and reviewing the statements of qualifications and evaluation         scores submitted by the evaluation committee under Subsection     d , the head of the         procurement unit using the request for statement of qualifications process under this section as         one of the stages of a multiple stage procurement process shall identify those vendors meeting         the minimum mandatory requirements, evaluation criteria, and applicable score thresholds as         qualified vendors who are allowed to participate in the remaining stages of the multiple stage         procurement process.

formula, weighting, and other         scoring procedures contained in the request for proposals                ii   review the evaluation committee s scores and correct any errors, scoring         inconsistencies, and reported noncompliance with this chapter                iii   add the scores calculated for cost, if applicable, to the evaluation committee s final         recommended scores on criteria other than cost to derive the total combined score for each         responsive and responsible proposal  and               iv   provide to the evaluation committee the total combined score calculated for each         responsive and responsible proposal, including any applicable cost formula, weighting, and         scoring procedures used to calculate the total combined scores.

performance ratings, references, management plan,         certifications, and other project specific criteria described in the solicitation                ii   may, as described in the solicitation, weight and score the management fee as a         fixed rate or as a fixed percentage of the estimated contract value                iii   may, at any time after the opening of the responses to the request for proposals,         have access to, and consider, the management fee proposed by the offerors  and               iv   except as provided in Subsection          , may not know or have access

At any time during the evaluation process, the evaluation committee, with the         approval of the director or the head of the issuing procurement unit, may                a   request best and final offers from responsible  and  offerors who have submitted         responsive  offerors  proposals that meet the minimum qualifications, evaluation criteria, or         applicable score thresholds identified in the request for proposals, if                i   no single proposal addresses all the specifications stated in the request for         proposals                ii   all or a significant number of the proposals are ambiguous on a material point and         the evaluation committee requires further clarification in order to conduct a fair evaluation of         proposals                iii   the evaluation committee needs additional information from all offerors to         complete the evaluation of proposals                iv   the differences between proposals in one or more material aspects are too slight to         allow the evaluation committee to distinguish between proposals                v   all cost proposals are too high or over budget  or               vi   another reason exists supporting a request for best and final offers, as provided in         rules established by the applicable rulemaking authority  and               b   evaluate those best and final offers.                   In requesting and evaluating best and final offers under Subsection    , the         evaluation committee shall                a   ensure that each offeror receives fair and equal treatment with respect to the other         offerors                b   establish a schedule and procedures for conducting discussions                c   ensure that information in each proposal and information gathered during         discussions is not shared with other offerors until the contract is awarded                d   ensure that auction tactics are not used in the discussion process, including         discussing and comparing the costs and features of other proposals  and               e   set a common date and time for the submission of best and final offers.                   In a best and final offer, an offeror                a   may address only the issues described in the request for best and final offers  and               b   may not correct a material error or deficiency in the offeror s proposal or address         any other issue not described in the request for best and final offers.                         If an offeror chooses not to participate in a discussion or does not make a         timely best and final offer, the offer submitted by the offeror before the conduct of discussions         shall be treated as the offeror s best and final offer.                   An applicable rulemaking authority shall make rules governing best and final offers         under this section.              Section   .  Section   G  a     is amended to read                 G  a    . Justification statement    Cost benefit analysis.                   a   In determining which proposal provides the best value to the procurement unit,         the evaluation committee and the conducting procurement unit shall prepare a written         justification statement that                i   explains the score assigned to each evaluation category                ii   explains how the proposal with the highest total combined score provides the best         value to the procurement unit in comparison to the other proposals                iii   if applicable, includes the cost benefit analysis described in Subsection     and         how the cost benefit analysis relates to the best value to the procurement unit  and               iv   if applicable, includes the written determination described in Subsection    .               b   An explanation under Subsection     a  i  need not address each criterion within         each category.                   If, in determining the best value to the procurement unit, the evaluation committee         awards the highest score, including the score for cost, to a proposal other than the lowest cost         proposal, and the difference between the cost of the highest scored proposal and the lowest cost         proposal exceeds the greater of    ,    or    of the lowest cost proposal, the evaluation         committee and the conducting procurement unit shall prepare an informal written cost benefit         analysis that                a   explains, in general terms, the advantage to the procurement unit of awarding the         contract to the higher cost offeror  and               b   except as provided in Subsection                    i   includes the estimated added financial value to the procurement unit of each         criterion that justifies awarding the contract to the higher cost offeror  and               ii   demonstrates that the value of the advantage to the procurement unit of awarding         the contract to the higher cost offeror exceeds the value of the difference between the cost of         the higher cost proposal and the cost of the lower cost proposals.                   If the informal cost benefit analysis described in Subsection     does not justify         awarding the contract to the offeror that received the highest score, the issuing procurement         unit                a   may not award the contract to the offeror that received the highest score  and               b   may award the contract to the offeror that received the next highest score, unless                i   an informal cost benefit analysis is required, because the difference between the         cost proposed by the offeror that received the next highest score and the lowest cost proposal         exceeds the greater of    ,    or    of the lowest cost proposal  and               ii   the informal cost benefit analysis does not justify award of the contract to the         offeror that received the next highest score.                   If the informal cost benefit analysis described in Subsection     does not justify         award of the contract to the offeror, described in Subsection    , that received the next highest         score, the issuing procurement unit                a   may not award the contract to the offeror that received the next highest score  and               b   shall continue with the process described in Subsection     for each offeror that         received the next highest score, until the issuing procurement unit                i   awards the contract in accordance with the provisions of this section  or               ii   cancels the request for proposals.                   a   The evaluation committee, with the issuing procurement unit s approval, may         waive, in whole or in part, a requirement under Subsection     b  if the evaluation committee         determines in writing that assigning a financial value to a particular procurement item or         evaluation criterion is not practicable.               b   A written determination under Subsection     a                 i   shall explain                A   why it is not practicable to assign a financial value to the procurement item or         evaluation criterion  and               B   in nonfinancial terms, why awarding the contract to the higher cost offeror         provides the best value to the procurement unit  and               ii   may be included as part of the justification statement.                   a   An issuing procurement unit is not required to make the cost benefit analysis         described in this section for a contract with a construction manager general contractor if the         contract is awarded based solely on the qualifications of the construction manager general         contractor and the management fee described in Subsection   G  a            .               b   The applicable rulemaking authority shall make rules that establish procedures and         criteria for awarding a contract described in Subsection     a  to ensure that                i   a competitive process is maintained  and               ii   the contract awarded is in the best interest of the procurement unit.
