The Legislature finds  a   developments in health care technology make possible many alternatives fortreating medical conditions and make possible the unnatural prolongation of life  b   individuals should have the clear legal choice to  i   accept or reject health care, even if rejecting health care will result in death soonerthan death would be expected to occur if rejected health care were started or continued  ii   be spared unwanted procedures  and iii   be permitted to die with a maximum of dignity and function and a minimum ofpain  c   Utah law should  i   provide individuals with a legal tool to designate a health care agent and expresspreferences about health care options to go into effect only after the individual loses the abilityto make or communicate health care decisions, including decisions about end of life care  and ii   promote a health care directive system that can be administered effectively withinthe health care system  d   surrogate decisions made on behalf of a person who previously had capacity tomake health care decisions, but who has lost health care decision making capacity should bebased on  i   input from the incapacitated person, to the extent possible under the circumstances  ii   specific preferences expressed by the individual prior to the loss of health caredecision making capacity  iii   the surrogate s understanding of the individual s health care preferences  and iv   the surrogate s understanding of what the individual would have wanted under thecircumstances  and e   surrogate decisions made on behalf of an individual who has never had health caredecision making capacity should be made on the basis of the individual s best interest.     In recognition of the dignity and privacy that all individuals are entitled to expect,and to protect the right of an individual to refuse to be treated without the individual s consent,the Legislature declares that this state recognizes the right to make binding health caredirectives directing health care providers to  a   provide life sustaining or life supporting medically indicated health care  b   withhold or withdraw health care  or c   provide health care only to the extent set forth in a health care directive.        a     .As used in this part       Agent  means a person designated in an advance health care directive to makehealth care decisions for the declarant.

Guardian  means a court appointed guardian.      Health care  means any care, treatment, service, or procedure to improve,maintain, diagnose, or otherwise affect an individual s physical or mental condition.

Health care directive   a   includes  i   a designation of an agent to make health care decisions for an individual when theindividual cannot make or communicate health care decisions  or ii   an expression of preferences about health care decisions  and b   may take one of the following forms  i   a written document, voluntarily executed by an individual in accordance with therequirements of this part  or ii   a witnessed oral statement, made by an individual, in accordance with therequirements of this part.       Health care facility  means  a   a health care facility as defined in Title   , Chapter   , Health Care FacilityLicensing and Inspection Act  and b   private offices of physicians, dentists, and other health care providers licensed toprovide health care under Title   , Occupations and Professions.       Health care provider  is defined in Section                .       Individual   a   means  i   a person    years of age or older  or ii   an emancipated minor as defined in Sections         a          to         a           and b   includes  i   a declarant  and ii   a person who has not completed an advance health care directive.

Surrogate  means a decision maker who is  a   an appointed agent  b   a default surrogate decision maker under the provisions of Section         a           or c   a court appointed guardian.        a     .     An individual is presumed to have  a   health care decision making capacity  and b   capacity to make or revoke a health care directive.     To overcome the presumption of capacity, a physician who has personallyexamined the individual and assessed the individual s health care decision making capacitymust  a   find that the individual lacks health care decision making capacity  b   record the finding in the individual s medical chart including an indication ofwhether the individual is likely to regain health care decision making capacity  and c   make a reasonable effort to communicate the determination to  i   the individual  ii   other health care providers or health care facilities that the physician wouldroutinely inform of such a finding  and iii   if the individual has a surrogate, any known surrogate.     a   If a physician finds that an individual lacks health care decision making capacityin accordance with Subsection    , the individual may at any time, challenge the finding by  i   submitting to a health care provider a written notice stating that the individualdisagrees with the physician s finding  or ii   orally informing the health care provider that the individual disagrees with thephysician s finding. b   A health care provider who is informed of a challenge pursuant to Subsection     a shall promptly inform an individual, if any, who is serving as surrogate of the individual schallenge. c   A surrogate informed of a challenge to a finding under this section, or theindividual if no surrogate is acting on the individual s behalf, shall inform the following of theindividual s challenge  i   any other health care providers involved in the individual s care  and ii   the health care facility, if any, in which the individual is receiving care. d   An individual s challenge to a finding under this section is binding on a health careprovider and a health care facility unless otherwise ordered by a court. e   If an individual does not challenge a finding, the health care provider and healthcare facility may rely on a surrogate to make health care decisions for the individual.     A health care provider or health care facility providing care to the individual thatrelies on a surrogate to make decisions on behalf of an individual has an ongoing obligation toconsider whether the individual continues to lack health care decision making capacity.     If at any time a health care provider finds, based on an examination and assessment,that the individual has regained health care decision making capacity, the health care providershall record the results of the assessment in the individual s medical record, and the individualcan direct his health care.        a     .     An individual is presumed to have the capacity to complete an advance health caredirective.     An individual who is found to lack health care decision making capacity under theprovisions of Section         a           a   lacks the capacity to give an advance health care directive, including Part II of theform created in Section         a         , or any other substantially similar form expressing a healthcare preference  and b   may retain the capacity to appoint an agent and complete Part I of the form createdin Section         a         .     The following factors shall be considered by a health care provider, attorney, orcourt when determining whether an individual described in Subsection     b  has retained thecapacity to appoint an agent  a   whether the individual has expressed over time an intent to appoint the same personas agent  b   whether the choice of agent is consistent with past relationships and patterns ofbehavior between the individual and the prospective agent, or, if inconsistent, whether there isa reasonable justification for the change  and c   whether the individual s expression of the intent to appoint the agent occurs at timeswhen, or in settings where, the individual has the greatest ability to make and communicatedecisions.        a     . .     a   The following persons may direct an emergency medical service providerlicensed or certified under Title   , Chapter  a, Utah Emergency Medical Services System Act,who responds to a call to provide emergency medical services as defined in Section         a        ,to withhold all life sustaining procedures  i   an individual over the age of     ii   an emancipated minor  or iii   the following person, if the person has a physician s order to withhold lifesustaining procedures that is issued in compliance with this section  A   a parent or legal guardian of a minor  B   a legal guardian appointed for an individual  or C   a surrogate. b   A person described in Subsection     a  iii  may direct an emergency serviceprovider to withhold life sustaining procedures if the person has a physician s order      i   made in compliance with Subsection      and     ii   if the physician s order applies to a minor, it must include a certification by twophysicians that in their clinical judgment an order to withhold life sustaining treatment is in thebest interest of the individual. c   The physician order is binding upon emergency medical services providers only ifthe physician order is in compliance with Subsections     and    .     a   The Department of Health shall by administrative rule establish a uniformsystem to allow emergency medical service providers to readily identify persons who haveobtained a physician order under this section. b   The system may provide for  i   personal, tamper proof identifying bracelets  ii   forms  iii   the presence of the physician s orders on a form in compliance with Subsection    and approved by the Department of Health  or iv   some other system approved by the Department of Health which clearly identifiesthe individual as one who has a continued intent to be readily identified as a person with aphysician s order to withhold life sustaining procedures.     An emergency medical services provider is not bound to act in accordance with aphysician order issued under this section unless the physician order complies with theadministrative rules adopted by the Department of Health in accordance with this section.     A physician order made under this section shall be  a   in writing and on a form approved by the Department of Health  b   signed by  i   the declarant  ii   a person in the declarant s presence and by the declarant s expressed direction  iii   the parent or legal guardian of a minor  or iv   if the declarant does not have the ability to give current directions concerning thedeclarant s care and treatment, the surrogate or class of surrogates with the highest priorityunder Section         a           c   dated  d   signed, completed, and certified by the declarant s licensed health care professional,acting within the scope of practice  and e   if for a minor, in compliance with Subsection     b .     A physician order made under this section takes precedence over a directive madeunder Section         a         , but only to the extent of a conflict.     An individual who wishes to revoke a physician order made under this section maydo so by  a   orally informing emergency service personnel  b   writing  void  across the form, or burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying ordefacing the document, bracelet, or other evidence of the physician order, or by asking anotherperson to do the same on the individual s behalf  c   signing or directing another person to sign a written revocation on the individual sbehalf  d   stating that the individual wishes to revoke the order in the presence of a witnesswho is age    or older  or e   signing a new physician order.     a   The Department of Health shall adopt rules in accordance with Title   , Chapter  a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, to  i   create the forms and systems required by Subsections     and      and ii   develop uniform instructions for the form established in Section         a         . b   The Department of Health may assist others with training of health careprofessionals regarding this chapter.        a     .     a   An individual may make an advance health care directive, in which theindividual may  i   appoint a health care agent or choose not to appoint a health care agent  ii   give directions for the care of the individual after the individual loses health caredecision making capacity or chooses not to give directions  iii   state conditions that must be met before life sustaining treatment may be withheldor withdrawn  iv   authorize an agent to consent to the individual s participation in medical research  v   nominate a guardian  vi   authorize an agent to consent to organ donation  vii   expand or limit the powers of a health care agent  and viii   designate the agent s access to the individual s medical records. b   An advance health care directive may be oral or written. c   An advance health care directive shall be witnessed by a disinterested individual. The witness may not be  i   the person who signed the directive on behalf of the declarant  ii   related to the declarant by blood or marriage  iii   entitled to any portion of the declarant s estate according to the laws of intestatesuccession of this state or under any will or codicil of the declarant  iv   directly financially responsible for the declarant s medical care  v   a health care provider who is providing care to the declarant or an administrator at ahealth care facility in which the declarant is receiving care  or vi   the appointed agent. d   The witness to an oral advance health care directive shall state the circumstancesunder which the directive was made.     Unless otherwise directed in a health care directive, the authority of an agent  a   is effective only after a physician makes a determination of incapacity as providedin Section         a           b   remains in effect during any period of time in which the declarant lacks capacity toappoint an agent or make health care decisions  and c   ceases to be effective when  i   a declarant disqualifies an agent or revokes the health care directive  ii   a health care provider finds that the declarant has health care decision makingcapacity  iii   a court issues an order invalidating a health care directive or the application of thehealth care directive  or iv   the individual has challenged the determination of incapacity under the provisionsof Subsection         a            .     An agent appointed under the provisions of this section may not be a health careprovider for the declarant, or an owner, operator, or employee of the health care facility atwhich the declarant is receiving care unless the agent is related to the declarant by blood,marriage, or adoption.     If the declarant does not specify the agent s access to medical records in an advancehealth care directive, the agent s access to medical records is governed by Section         a         .        a     .     a   Any member of the class described in Subsection     b  may act as anindividual s surrogate health care decision maker if  i   the appointed agent or court appointed guardian is absent or not reasonablyavailable  and ii   the member of the class described in Subsection     b  is  A   over    years of age  B   has health care decision making capacity  C   is reasonably available  and D   has not been disqualified by the individual. b   The following classes of the individual s family, in descending order of priority,may act as the individual s surrogate, however an individual in a lower priority class has norights to direct an individual s care if a member of a higher priority class is able and willing toact as surrogate  i   the individual s spouse, unless  A   divorced or legally separated from the individual  or B   a court finds that the spouse has acted in a manner that should preclude the spousefrom having a priority position as a default surrogate  ii   a child  iii   a parent  iv   a sibling  v   a grandparent  or vi   a grandchild.     If the family members designated in Subsection     b  are not reasonably availableto act as a surrogate decision maker, a person other than those designated in Subsection    may act as a surrogate if the person  a   has health care decision making capacity  b   has exhibited special care and concern for the patient  c   is familiar with the patient s personal values  and d   is reasonably available to act as a surrogate.     The surrogate shall communicate the surrogate s assumption of authority aspromptly as practicable to the members of a class who  a   have an equal or higher priority and are not acting as surrogate  and b   can be readily contacted.     A health care provider shall comply with the decision of a majority of the membersof a class who have communicated their views to the provider if  a   more than one member of a class assumes authority to act as default surrogate  b   the members of the class do not agree on a health care decision  and c   the health care provider is informed of the disagreement among the members of theclass.     a   The individual may at any time disqualify a default surrogate, including amember of the individual s family, from acting as the individual s surrogate by  i   a signed writing  ii   personally informing a witness of the disqualification so long as the witness is not  A   related to the individual by blood or marriage  B   entitled to any portion of the declarant s estate according to the laws of intestatesuccession of this state or under any will or codicil of the declarant  C   directly financially responsible for the declarant s medical care  D   a health care provider who is providing care to the declarant or an administrator ata health care facility in which the declarant is receiving care  or E   an individual who would become a default surrogate after the disqualification  or iii   verbally informing the default surrogate of the disqualification. b   Disqualification of a default surrogate is effective even if the individual has beendetermined to lack health care decision making capacity.     If reasonable doubt exists regarding the status of an individual claiming the right toact as a default surrogate, the health care provider may  a   require the person to provide a sworn statement giving facts and circumstancesreasonably sufficient to establish the claimed authority  or b   seek a ruling from the court under Section         a         .     A health care provider may seek a ruling from a court pursuant to Section       a          if the health care provider has evidence that a surrogate is making decisions thatare inconsistent with the individual s wishes or preferences.        a     .     An individual with health care decision making capacity retains the right to makehealth care decisions as long as the individual has health care decision making capacity asdefined in Section         a         .  For purposes of this part, the inability to communicate throughspeech does not mean that the individual lacks health care decision making capacity.     An individual s current health care decisions, however expressed or indicated,always supersede an individual s prior decisions or health care directives.     An individual s health care directive takes effect only after the individual loseshealth care decision making capacity or the individual grants current authority to an agent inaccordance with Section         a         .        a     .     A surrogate decision maker acting under the authority of either Section         a        or         a          shall make health care decisions in accordance with  a   the individual s current preferences, to the extent possible  b   the individual s written or oral health care directions, if any, unless the health caredirective indicates that the surrogate may override the individual s health care directions  and c   other wishes, preferences, and beliefs, to the extent known to the surrogate.     If the surrogate does not know, and has no ability to know, the wishes orpreferences of the individual, the surrogate shall make a decision based upon an objectivedetermination of what is in the individual s best interest.     A surrogate acting under authority of Sections         a          and         a           a   may not admit the individual to a licensed health care facility for long termcustodial placement other than for assessment, rehabilitative, or respite care without theconsent of the individual  and b   may make health care decisions, including decisions to terminate life sustainingtreatment for the individual in accordance with Subsections     and    .     A surrogate acting under authority of this section is not subject to civil or criminalliability or claims of unprofessional conduct for surrogate health care decisions made inaccordance with Section         c          and made in good faith.        a     .The following is the order of priority of those authorized to make health care decisionson behalf of an individual who lacks decision making capacity      a health care agent appointed by an individual under the provisions of Section       a          unless the agent has been disqualified by  a   the individual  or b   a court of law      a court appointed guardian  or     a default surrogate acting under authority of Section         a         .        a     .     A court appointed guardian shall comply with the individual s advance health caredirective and may not revoke the individual s advance health care directive unless the courtexpressly revokes the individual s directive.     A health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that of a guardian, in theabsence of a court order to the contrary.     Except as provided in Subsections     and    , a health care decision made by aguardian for the individual is effective without judicial approval.     A guardian is not subject to civil or criminal liability or to claims of unprofessionalconduct for surrogate health care decision in accordance with Section         a          made ingood faith.        a     .A surrogate or a guardian appointed in compliance with this part, becomes a personalrepresentative for the individual under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actof      when      the individual loses health care decision making capacity      the individual grants current authority to the surrogate either  a   in writing  or b   by other expression before a witness who is not the surrogate or agent  or     the court appoints a guardian authorized to make health care decisions on behalf ofthe individual.        a     .     An advance directive may be revoked at any time by the declarant by  a   writing  void  across the document  b   obliterating, burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying or defacing the document inany manner indicating an intent to revoke  c   instructing another to do one of the acts described in Subsection     a  or  b   d   a written revocation of the directive signed and dated by  i   the declarant  or ii   a person  A   signing on behalf of the declarant  and B   acting at the direction of the declarant  e   an oral expression of an intent to revoke the directive in the presence of a witnesswho is age    years or older and who is not  i   related to the declarant by blood or marriage  ii   entitled to any portion of the declarant s estate according to the laws of intestatesuccession of this state or under any will or codicil of the declarant  iii   directly financially responsible for the declarant s medical care  iv   a health care provider who is providing care to the declarant or an administrator ata health care facility in which the declarant is receiving care  or v   the person who will become agent or default surrogate after the revocation  or f   a decree of annulment, divorce, dissolution of marriage, or legal separation thatrevokes the designation of a spouse as an agent, unless  i   otherwise specified in the decree  or ii   the declarant has affirmed the intent to retain the agent subsequent to theannulment, divorce, or legal separation.     An advance health care directive that conflicts with an earlier advance health caredirective revokes the earlier directive to the extent of the conflict.        a     .     It is the responsibility of the declarant or surrogate, to the extent that theresponsibility is not assigned to a health care provider or health care facility by state or federallaw, to notify or provide for notification to a health care provider and a health care facility of  a   the existence of a health care directive  b   the revocation of a health care directive  c   the existence or revocation of appointment of an agent or default surrogate  d   the disqualification of a default surrogate  or e   the appointment or revocation of appointment of a guardian.     a   A health care provider or health care facility is not subject to civil or criminalliability or to claims of unprofessional conduct for failing to act upon a health care directive, arevocation of a health care directive, or a disqualification of a surrogate until the health careprovider or health care facility has received an oral directive from an individual or a copy of awritten directive or revocation of the health care directive, or the disqualification of thesurrogate. b   A health care provider and health care facility that is notified under Subsection    shall include in the individual s medical record  i   the health care directive or a copy of it, a revocation of a health care directive, or adisqualification of a surrogate  and ii   the date, time, and place in which any written or oral notice of the documentdescribed in this Subsection     b  is received.     A health care provider or health care facility acting in good faith and in accordancewith generally accepted health care standards is not subject to civil or criminal liability or todiscipline for unprofessional conduct for  a   complying with a health care decision made by a surrogate apparently havingauthority to make a health care decision for an individual, including a decision to withhold orwithdraw health care  b   declining to comply with a health care decision of a surrogate based on a belief thatthe surrogate then lacked authority  c   declining to comply with a health care decision of an individual who lacks decisionmaking capacity  d   seeking a judicial determination under Section         a          of  i   the validity of a health care directive  ii   the validity of directions from a surrogate or guardian  iii   the decision making capacity of an individual who challenges a physician s findingof incapacity  or iv   the authority of a guardian or surrogate  or e   complying with an advance health care directive and assuming that the directivewas valid when made, and has not been revoked or terminated.     a   Health care providers and health care facilities shall  i   cooperate with a person authorized under this part to make written directivesconcerning health care  ii   unless the provisions of Subsection     b  apply, comply with  A   a health care decision of an individual  and B   a health care decision made by a surrogate then authorized to make health caredecisions for an individual, to the same extent as if the decision had been made by theindividual  and iii   before implementing a health care decision made by a surrogate, make areasonable attempt to communicate to the individual  A   the decision made  and B   the identity of the surrogate making the decision. b   A health care provider or health care facility may decline to comply with a healthcare instruction or health care decision if  i   in the opinion of the health care provider  A   the individual lacks health care decision making capacity  B   the surrogate lacks health care decision making capacity  C   the health care provider has evidence that the surrogate s instructions areinconsistent with the individual s health care instructions, or, for an individual who has alwayslacked health care decision making capacity, that the surrogate s instructions are inconsistentwith the best interest of the individual  or D   there is reasonable doubt regarding the status of an individual claiming the right toact as a default surrogate, in which case the health care provider shall comply with Subsection       a              or ii   the health care provider declines to comply for reasons of conscience. c   A health care provider or health care facility that declines to comply with a healthcare instruction in accordance with Subsection     b  must  i   promptly inform the individual and any agent, surrogate, or guardian of the reasonfor refusing to comply with the health care instruction  ii   make a good faith attempt to resolve the conflict  and iii   provide continuing care to the individual until the issue is resolved or until atransfer can be made to a health care provider or health care facility that will implement therequested instruction or decision. d   A health care provider or health care facility that declines to comply with a healthcare instruction, after meeting the obligations set forth in Subsection     c  may transfer theindividual to a health care provider or health care facility that will carry out the requestedhealth care decisions. e   A health care facility may decline for reasons of conscience under Subsection    b  ii  if  i   the health care decision or instruction is contrary to a policy of the facility that isexpressly based on reasons of conscience  ii   the policy was timely communicated to the individual and the individual ssurrogate  iii   the facility promptly informs the individual, if possible, and any surrogate thenauthorized to make decisions for the individual  iv   the facility provides continuing care to the individual until a transfer can be madeto a health care facility that will implement the requested instruction or decision  and v   unless the individual or surrogate then authorized to make health care decisions foran individual refuses assistance, immediately make all reasonable efforts to assist in thetransfer of the individual to another health care facility that will carry out the instructions ordecisions.     A health care provider and health care facility  a   may not require or prohibit the creation or revocation of an advance health caredirective as a condition for providing health care  and b   shall comply with all state and federal laws governing advance health caredirectives.        a     .     A health care directive executed under this part is presumed valid and binding.     Health care providers and health care facilities, in the absence of notice to thecontrary, shall presume that a declarant who executed a health care directive, whether or not inthe presence of a health care provider, had the required decision making capacity at the time thedeclarant signed the directive.  The fact a declarant executed a health care directive shall not beconstrued as an indication that the declarant was suffering from mental illness or lackeddecision making capacity.        a     .

To overcome the presumption of capacity, a physician who has personally                           examined the individual and assessed the individual s health care decision making capacity                           must                                  a   find that the individual lacks health care decision making capacity                                  b   record the finding in the individual s medical chart including an indication of                              whether the individual is likely to regain health care decision making capacity  and                                 c   make a reasonable effort to communicate the determination to                                  i   the individual                                  ii   other health care providers or health care facilities that the physician would                           routinely inform of such a finding  and                                 iii   if the individual has a surrogate, any known surrogate.                                     a   If a physician finds that an individual lacks health care decision making capacity                           in accordance with Subsection    , the individual may at any time, challenge the finding by                                  i   submitting to a health care provider a written notice stating that the individual                           disagrees with the physician s finding  or                                 ii   orally informing the health care provider that the individual disagrees with the                           physician s finding.                                 b   A health care provider who is informed of a challenge pursuant to Subsection     a                            shall promptly inform an individual, if any, who is serving as surrogate of the individual s                           challenge.                                 c   A surrogate informed of a challenge to a finding under this section, or the                           individual if no surrogate is acting on the individual s behalf, shall inform the following of the                           individual s challenge                                  i   any other health care providers involved in the individual s care  and                                 ii   the health care facility, if any, in which the individual is receiving care.                                 d   An individual s challenge to a finding under this section is binding on a health care                           provider and a health care facility unless otherwise ordered by a court.                                 e   If an individual does not challenge a finding, the health care provider and health                           care facility may rely on a surrogate to make health care decisions for the individual.                                     A health care provider or health care facility providing care to the individual that                           relies on a surrogate to make decisions on behalf of an individual has an ongoing obligation to                           consider whether the individual continues to lack health care decision making capacity.                                     If at any time a health care provider finds, based on an examination and assessment,                              that the individual has regained health care decision making capacity, the health care provider                           shall record the results of the assessment in the individual s medical record, and the individual                           can direct his health care.

For purposes of this part, the inability to communicate through                           speech does not mean that the individual lacks health care decision making capacity.

                      authority to make a health care decision for an individual, including a decision to withhold or                           withdraw health care                                  b   declining to comply with a health care decision of a surrogate based on a belief that                           the surrogate then lacked authority                                  c   declining to comply with a health care decision of an individual who lacks decision                           making capacity                                  d   seeking a judicial determination under Section

comply with                                  A   a health care decision of an individual  and                                 B   a health care decision made by a surrogate then authorized to make health care                           decisions for an individual, to the same extent as if the decision had been made by the                           individual  and                                 iii   before implementing a health care decision made by a surrogate, make a                           reasonable attempt to communicate to the individual                                  A   the decision made  and                                 B   the identity of the surrogate making the decision.                                 b   A health care provider or health care facility may decline to comply with a health                           care instruction or health care decision if                                  i   in the opinion of the health care provider                                  A   the individual lacks health care decision making capacity                                  B   the surrogate lacks health care decision making capacity                                  C   the health care provider has evidence that the surrogate s instructions are                           inconsistent with the individual s health care instructions, or, for an individual who has always                           lacked health care decision making capacity, that the surrogate s instructions are inconsistent                           with the best interest of the individual  or                                 D   there is reasonable doubt regarding the status of an individual claiming the right to                           act as a default surrogate, in which case the health care provider shall comply with Subsection                                  a              or                                 ii   the health care provider declines to comply for reasons of conscience.                                 c   A health care provider or health care facility that declines to comply with a health                           care instruction in accordance with Subsection     b  must                                     i   promptly inform the individual and any agent, surrogate, or guardian of the reason                           for refusing to comply with the health care instruction                                  ii   make a good faith attempt to resolve the conflict  and                                 iii   provide continuing care to the individual until the issue is resolved or until a                           transfer can be made to a health care provider or health care facility that will implement the                           requested instruction or decision.                                 d   A health care provider or health care facility that declines to comply with a health                           care instruction, after meeting the obligations set forth in Subsection     c  may transfer the                           individual to a health care provider or health care facility that will carry out the requested                           health care decisions.                                 e   A health care facility may decline for reasons of conscience under Subsection                               b  ii  if                                  i   the health care decision or instruction is contrary to a policy of the facility that is                           expressly based on reasons of conscience                                  ii   the policy was timely communicated to the individual and the individual s                           surrogate                                  iii   the facility promptly informs the individual, if possible, and any surrogate then                           authorized to make decisions for the individual                                  iv   the facility provides continuing care to the individual until a transfer can be made                           to a health care facility that will implement the requested instruction or decision  and                                 v   unless the individual or surrogate then authorized to make health care decisions for                           an individual refuses assistance, immediately make all reasonable efforts to assist in the                           transfer of the individual to another health care facility that will carry out the instructions or                           decisions.                                     A health care provider and health care facility                                  a   may not require or prohibit the creation or revocation of an advance health care                           directive as a condition for providing health care  and                                 b   shall comply with all state and federal laws governing advance health care                              directives.

A health care directive executed under this part is presumed valid and binding.                                     Health care providers and health care facilities, in the absence of notice to the                           contrary, shall presume that a declarant who executed a health care directive, whether or not in                           the presence of a health care provider, had the required decision making capacity at the time the                           declarant signed the directive.  The fact a declarant executed a health care directive shall not be                           construed as an indication that the declarant was suffering from mental illness or lacked                           decision making capacity.

Part II   Allows you to record your wishes about health care in writing.                           Part III   Tells you how to revoke the form.                           Part IV   Makes your directive legal.
