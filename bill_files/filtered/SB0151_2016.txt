C      .     In a hearing required under Subsection   C          b , an agency shall  a   permit all evidence of the existence or nonexistence of blight within the survey areato be presented  and b   permit each record owner of property located within the survey area or the recordproperty owner s representative the opportunity to  i   examine and cross examine each witness that provides evidence of the existence ornonexistence of blight  and ii   present evidence and testimony, including expert testimony, concerning theexistence or nonexistence of blight.     An agency shall allow each record owner of property located within a survey areathe opportunity, for at least    days before the day on which the hearing takes place, to reviewthe evidence of blight compiled by the agency or by the person or firm conducting the blightstudy for the agency, including any expert report.       C      .     A board may not make a finding of blight in a resolution under Subsection  C          c  ii  unless the board finds that  a   i   the survey area consists predominantly of nongreenfield parcels  ii   the survey area is currently zoned for urban purposes and generally served byutilities  iii   at least     of the parcels within the survey area contain nonagricultural ornonaccessory buildings or improvements used or intended for residential, commercial,industrial, or other urban purposes  iv   the present condition or use of the survey area substantially impairs the soundgrowth of the community, delays the provision of housing accommodations, constitutes aneconomic liability, or is detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, as shown by theexistence within the survey area of at least four of the following factors  A   although sometimes interspersed with well maintained buildings and infrastructure,substantial physical dilapidation, deterioration, or defective construction of buildings orinfrastructure, or significant noncompliance with current building code, safety code, healthcode, or fire code requirements or local ordinances  B   unsanitary or unsafe conditions in the survey area that threaten the health, safety, orwelfare of the community  C   environmental hazards, as defined in state or federal law, which requireremediation as a condition for current or future use and development  D   excessive vacancy, abandoned buildings, or vacant lots within an area zoned forurban use and served by utilities  E   abandoned or outdated facilities that pose a threat to public health, safety, orwelfare  F   criminal activity in the survey area, higher than that of comparable nonblightedareas in the municipality or county  and G   defective or unusual conditions of title rendering the title nonmarketable  and v   A   at least     of the privately owned parcels within the survey area are affectedby at least one of the factors, but not necessarily the same factor, listed in Subsection     a  iv  and B   the affected parcels comprise at least     of the privately owned acreage withinthe survey area  or b   the survey area includes some or all of a superfund site, inactive industrial site, orinactive airport site.     A single parcel comprising     or more of the acreage within the survey area maynot be counted as satisfying the requirement described in Subsection     a  iii  or  iv  unless atleast     of the area of the parcel is occupied by buildings or improvements.     a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , for purposes of Subsection    , if aparticipant or proposed participant involved in the project area development has caused acondition listed in Subsection     a  iv  within the survey area, that condition may not be usedin the determination of blight. b   Subsection     a  does not apply to a condition that was caused by an owner ortenant who later becomes a participant.

which a school district would otherwise         be entitled to receive under this Subsection     may not be reduced for the sole reason that the         district s levy is reduced as a consequence of changes in the certified tax rate under Section                  pursuant to changes in property valuation.               ii   Subsection     d  i  applies for a period of five years following any

current fiscal year  and               B   distribute the state contribution to the voted and board local levy programs to         school districts based on the increased value of the state guarantee

 existing authority unless the proposition submitted to the electors expressly so states.               b   A majority vote opposing a modification does not deprive the district of authority to         continue the levy.               c   If adoption of a voted local levy is contingent upon an offset reducing other local         school board levies, the board must allow the electors, in an election, to consider modifying or         discontinuing the imposition of the levy prior to a subsequent increase in other levies that         would increase the total local school board levy.               d   Nothing contained in this section terminates, without an election, the authority of a         school district to continue imposing an existing voted local levy previously authorized by the         voters as a voted leeway program.
