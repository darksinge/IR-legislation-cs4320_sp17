The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such        proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.

The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in        default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between        the Commission and the defaulting state.              . The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S.        District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its        principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including        reasonable attorney s fees.             C. Dispute Resolution              .

The relief sought may include both        injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing        member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney s fees.              . The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The        Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.             SECTION   .

Any state that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission s initial adoption of        the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes        law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the        full force and effect of administrative rule on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.             C. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing        the same.              . A member state s withdrawal shall not take effect until six     months after        enactment of the repealing statute.              . Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state s        physical therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting        requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.             D.

If this Compact shall        be held contrary to the constitution of any party state, the Compact shall remain in full force        and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the party state        affected as to all severable matters.
