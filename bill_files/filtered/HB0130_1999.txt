 , Constitutional Defense Council.       Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM     This legislation raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns    Federal law directs that, in allocating mineral lease monies, state legislatures shall give priority in  the allocation and use of funds to those subdivisions of the state socially or economically impacted  by development of minerals leased under the mineral leasing act for     planning      construction  and maintenance of public facilities  and     provision of public services.   This bill would divert mineral lease monies to the Constitutional Defense Restricted Account to  be appropriated to the Constitutional Defense Council.  This use of mineral lease monies may  violate federal law.  The constitutionality of the bill could be challenged based on the Supremacy  Clause  Article VI, Section    of the United States Constitution.
