Section   A  a     is amended to read               A  a    . Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of       state.                 a   Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a       parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the       parent s children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves       to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions       or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s       children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened       protection against government interference with the parent s fundamental rights and liberty       interests.             b   The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and       management of the parent s children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist       simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent s child is placed in       the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing       the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government       action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or       alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental       unfitness, and the child suffers, or is substantially likely to suffer, serious detriment as a result,       the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of       their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s parents are       adversaries.             c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and       supervision of the child s natural parents.  A child s need for a normal family life in a       permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships is usually best met by the       child s natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit and the right of parents to       conceive and raise their children are constitutionally protected.  The right of a fit, competent       parent to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a fundamental       liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution and is a fundamental       public policy of this state.             d   The state recognizes that              i   a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,       train, educate, provide and care for, and reasonably discipline the parent s children  and             ii   the state s role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.             e   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty       to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their       children.             f   Subsections     through     shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this       Subsection    .                 It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection       from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,       prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title   A,       Chapter  , Juvenile Court Act of     .  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest in       and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide       for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a       substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and       proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take action for       the welfare and protection of the parent s children.                 When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,       it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm and the extent to       which the child s extended family may provide needed protection.  Throughout its involvement,       the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to protect a       child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families, rather       than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.                 When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s immediate safety       or welfare, the division may seek custody of the child for a planned, temporary period and       place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this section and in       accordance with the requirements of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and       Dependency Proceedings, and              a   when safe and appropriate, return the child to the child s parent  or             b   as a last resort, pursue another permanency plan.                 In determining and making  reasonable efforts  with regard to a child, pursuant to       the provisions of Section   A  a    , both the division s and the court s paramount concern       shall be the child s health, safety, and welfare.  The desires of a parent for the parent s child,       and the constitutionally protected rights of a parent, as described in this section, shall be given       full and serious consideration by the division and the court.                 In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe        abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make  reasonable efforts  or        to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home, provide reunification        services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection     does        not exempt the division from providing court ordered services.                  a   The division shall strive to achieve appropriate permanency for children who are        abused, neglected, or dependent.  The division shall provide in home services, where        appropriate and safe, in an effort to help a parent to correct the behavior that resulted in abuse,        neglect, or dependency of the parent s child.   If  The division may pursue a foster placement        only if in home services fail or are otherwise insufficient or inappropriate , the .  The division        shall also seek qualified extended family support or a kinship placement to maintain a sense of        security and stability for the child.  If in home services and kinship placement are not safe or        appropriate, or in home services and kinship placement fail and cannot be corrected , the        division may pursue a foster placement .              b   If the use or continuation of  reasonable efforts,  as described in Subsections            and    , is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for a child, then measures        shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan,        and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.              c   Subject to the parental rights recognized and protected under this section, if,         because of a parent s conduct or condition, the parent is determined to be unfit or incompetent        based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title   A, Chapter  , Part         , Termination of Parental Rights Act, the continuing welfare and best interest of the child is of        paramount importance, and shall be protected in determining whether that parent s rights        should be terminated.                  The state s right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health        care for a child is subject to  Subsection  Subsections   A           d  and   A          n         and Section   A      . .

    that causes the child to suffer emotional damage  and              ii   there are no reasonable means available by which the child s emotional health may        be protected without removing the child from the custody of the child s parent or guardian               c   the child or another child residing in the same household has been, or is considered        to be at substantial risk of being, physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited, by a        parent or guardian, a member of the parent s or guardian s household, or other person known to        the parent or

substantiated abuser or under similar circumstance as the previous        abuse, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the        custody of the child s parent.              b   For purposes of Subsection     c                i   another child residing in the same household may not be removed from the home        unless that child is considered to be at substantial risk of being physically abused, sexually        abused, or sexually exploited as described in Subsection     c  or Subsection     b  ii   and              ii   if a parent or guardian has received actual notice that physical abuse, sexual abuse,        or sexual exploitation by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence that        the parent or guardian failed to protect the child, after having received the notice, by allowing        the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie        evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically abused, sexually abused, or        sexually exploited.                  In the absence of one of the factors described in Subsection    , a court may not        remove a child from the parent s or guardian s custody on the basis of               a   educational neglect, truancy, or failure to comply with a court order to attend        school               b   mental illness or poverty of the parent or guardian  or              c   disability of the parent or guardian, as defined in Section        .

This section does not preclude removal of a child from the child s home without a        warrant or court order under Section   A  a    . .                  a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , a court or the Division of Child and        Family Services may not remove a child from the custody of the child s parent or guardian on        the sole or primary basis that the parent or guardian refuses to consent to               i   the administration of a psychotropic medication to a child               ii   a psychiatric, psychological, or behavioral treatment for a child  or              iii   a psychiatric or behavioral health evaluation of a child.              b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , a court or the Division of Child and Family        Services may remove a child under conditions that would otherwise be prohibited under        Subsection     a  if failure to take an action described under Subsection     a  would present a        serious, imminent risk to the child s physical safety or the physical safety of others.

If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to        the court               a   the reason why the child was removed from the parent s or guardian s custody               b   any services provided to the child and the child s family in an effort to prevent        removal               c   the need, if any, for continued shelter               d   the available services that could facilitate the return of the child to the custody of        the child s parent or guardian  and              e   subject to Subsections   A           c  through  e , whether any relatives of the        child or friends of the child s parents may be able and willing to accept temporary placement of        the child.

provide the notice        described in Subsection     within the time described in Subsection    , the court may grant the        request of a parent or guardian for a continuance, not to exceed five judicial days.                  a   If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the court shall order that        the child be  released from the protective custody of the division  returned to the custody of the        parent or guardian unless it finds, by  a preponderance of the  clear and convincing evidence,        that any one of the following exist               i   subject to Subsection     b  i , there is a substantial danger to the physical health or        safety of the child and the child s physical health or safety may not be protected without

in the child s growth, development, or psychological        functioning               B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that        would sufficiently prevent future damage  and               B    C   there are no reasonable means available by which the child s emotional health        may be protected without removing the child from the custody of

a        reasonable period of time poses a threat to the child s health or safety  and              B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that        would remove the threat               xi   A   the child or a minor residing in the same household has been neglected  and              B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that        would prevent the neglect               xii   the parent, guardian, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent or        guardian, is charged or arrested pursuant to Title   , Chapter   d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act,        and any clandestine laboratory operation was located in the residence or on the property where        the child resided               xiii   A   the child s welfare is substantially endangered   or  and              B   the parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to make reasonable changes that        would remove the danger  or

agency as the primary suspect in an investigation        for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child  or              C   is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or        recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child.              b   i   Prima facie evidence of the finding described in Subsection     a  i  is        established if               A   a court previously adjudicated that the child suffered abuse, neglect, or dependency        involving the parent  and              B   a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent occurs.              ii   For purposes of Subsection     a  iv , if the court finds that the parent knowingly        allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice        that the person physically abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited the child, that fact        constitutes prima facie evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically        abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited.                   a   i   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether        reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the        child s home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued        removal.              ii   If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child s        parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with        the child s parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.              b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a , and in ordering and        providing services, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in        accordance with federal law.                   Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency        situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that        any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                   In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe        abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make         reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home,        return a child to the child s home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the        offending parent or parents.                   The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of        educational neglect as described in Subsection   A                 b , truancy, or failure to        comply with a court order to attend school.                   a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section, the        court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.              b   If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home, the court shall        state the facts on which that decision is based.                   If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for        the protection of a child  because harm may result to the child if the child were returned home         pursuant to Subsection     a , the court shall order continued removal regardless of               a   any error in the initial removal of the child               b   the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions  or              c   any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child        and Family Services.             Section  .  Section   A       is amended to read                A      . Dispositional hearing    Reunification services    Exceptions.                  The court may               a   make any of the dispositions described in Section   A                     b   place the minor in the custody or guardianship of any               i   individual  or              ii   public or private entity or agency  or              c   order               i   protective supervision               ii   family preservation               iii   subject to Subsections      b   and ,   A           d , and   A          n   iii          and Section   A      . , medical or mental health treatment  or              iv   other services.                  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing, and that        the minor remain in the custody of the division, the court shall first               a   establish a primary permanency goal for the minor  and              b   determine whether, in view of the primary permanency goal, reunification services        are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, pursuant to Subsections      through     .                  Subject to Subsections     and    , if the court determines that reunification        services are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, the court shall provide for        reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,        unless parent time is not in the best interest of the minor.                  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe        abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make         reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to        attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                  In all cases, the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the court s paramount        concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.                  For purposes of Subsection    , parent time is in the best interests of a minor unless        the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to               a   protect the physical safety of the minor               b   protect the life of the minor  or              c   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the        minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.                  Notwithstanding Subsection    , a court may not deny parent time based solely on a        parent s failure to               a   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or              b   comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.                  a   In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a        concurrent permanency goal that shall include               i   a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal will        be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal  and              ii   an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency        goal.              b   In determining the primary permanency goal and concurrent permanency goal, the        court shall consider               i   the preference for kinship placement over nonkinship placement               ii   the potential for a guardianship placement if the parent child relationship is legally        terminated and no appropriate adoption placement is available  and              iii   the use of an individualized permanency goal, only as a last resort.                  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection          A          b  within    days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if        something other than reunification is initially established as a minor s primary permanency        goal.                   a   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency goal before the        establishment of a final permanency plan under Section   A      .              b   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event        that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.              c   If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s primary        permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section          A       on or before the earlier of               i      days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this        Subsection      c   or              ii   the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section          A      , ends.                   a   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order        that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor s        parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.              b   In providing the services described in Subsection      a , the minor s health, safety,        and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern, and the court shall so order.                   a   The court shall               i   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child        and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division               ii   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family        plan in accordance with Subsection   A  a        e   and              iii   identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the parties,        the responsibilities described in Subsection      a  ii , for the purpose of assisting in any future        determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and        federal law.              b   If the parent is in a substance abuse treatment program, other than a certified drug        court program               i   the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in        addition to the testing recommended by the parent s substance abuse program based on a        finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol  and              ii   the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing        recommended by the substance abuse program to the court or division.                   a   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the        date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home, unless the time period is        extended under Subsection   A         .              b   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire           months of reunification services.                   a   If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at        any time.              b   If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined        to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section          A      , then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to               i   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and              ii   complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the        minor.                   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period        described in Subsections      through      does not interrupt the running of the period.                   a   If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted        by the court in accordance with Section   A       at the expiration of the time period for        reunification services.              b   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original        removal of the minor.              c   If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted        within    days, in accordance with Section   A      .                   With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are        ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six        months from the date that reunification services were ordered               a   the court shall terminate reunification services  and              b   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                   When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section          A      , the court shall attempt to keep the minor s sibling group together if keeping the        sibling group together is               a   practicable  and              b   in accordance with the best interest of the minor.                   a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide        permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a        parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.              b   The court may determine that               i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate,        based on the individual circumstances  and              ii   reunification services should not be provided.              c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor, and in        making  reasonable efforts,  the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount        concern.                   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a        parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following        circumstances exist               a   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit        indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent               b   subject to Subsection      a , the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such        magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services               c   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,        sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor                i   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent                ii   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and               iii   is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual         exploitation                d   the parent                i   caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect                ii   committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit                A   murder or manslaughter of a child  or               B   child abuse homicide                iii   committed sexual abuse against the child                iv   is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender  or               v   A   intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes the death of another parent of the         child                B   is identified by a law enforcement agency as the primary suspect in an investigation         for intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child  or               C   is being prosecuted for or has been convicted of intentionally, knowingly, or         recklessly causing the death of another parent of the child                e   the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the         parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the         minor                f   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,         and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the         offending parent                g   the parent s rights are terminated with regard to any other minor                h   the minor was removed from the minor s home on at least two previous occasions         and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times                i   the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer                j   the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a         location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation         was located                k   except as provided in Subsection      b , with respect to a parent who is the child s         birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or was         exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child s mother while the child         was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the mother         agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a         substance abuse treatment program approved by the department  or               l   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification         efforts or services.                    a   The finding under Subsection      b  shall be based on competent evidence         from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing         that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately         caring for the minor within    months after the day on which the court finding is made.               b   A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection      k  if the court finds, under         the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection              k  is not warranted.                    In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take         into consideration                a   failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child         and family plan                b   the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of         drugs or alcohol                c   any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family         member                d   whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor                e   any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse                f   testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be         successful  and               g   whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.                    a   If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections      through             , and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which         the out of home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide         reunification services.               b   The time limits described in Subsections     through      are not tolled by the         parent s absence.                    a   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable         services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.               b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a , the court shall         consider                i   the age of the minor                ii   the degree of parent child bonding                iii   the length of the sentence                iv   the nature of the treatment                v   the nature of the crime or illness                vi   the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered                vii   for a minor    years of age or older, the minor s attitude toward the         implementation of family reunification services  and               viii   any other appropriate factors.               c   Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations         imposed in Subsections     through     .               d   Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time         limitations imposed in Subsections     through     , unless the court determines that continued         reunification services would be in the minor s best interest.                    If, pursuant to Subsections      b  through  l , the court does not order         reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within    days, in accordance         with Section   A      .
