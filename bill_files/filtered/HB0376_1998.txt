Section    A       is amended to read                  A      .  Examinations and alternatives.                   a   Whenever the commissioner considers it necessary in order to inform himself about          any matter related to the enforcement of this title, the commissioner may examine the affairs and          condition of                i   a licensee under this title                ii   an applicant for a license under this title                iii   a person or organization of persons doing or in process of organizing to do an          insurance business in this state  or               iv   a person who is not, but should be, licensed under this title.               b   When reasonably necessary for an examination under Subsection     a , the          commissioner may examine the accounts, records, documents, or evidences of transactions of the          insurer or other licensee, so far as they relate to the examinee, of any officer or other person who          has executive authority over or is in charge of any segment of the examinee s affairs, or of any          affiliate of the examinee.               c   On demand, each examinee under Subsection     a  shall make available to the                 commissioner for examination any of its own accounts, records, files, documents, or evidences of         transactions and, to the extent reasonably necessary for an examination, those of any persons under         Subsection     b .  Failure to make these documents available is concealment of records under         Subsection   A          .  However, if the examinee is unable to obtain accounts, records, files,         documents, or evidences of transactions from persons under Subsection     b , that failure is not         concealment if the examinee immediately terminates the relationship with the other person.              d   Neither the commissioner nor an examiner may remove any account, record, file,         document, evidence of transaction, or other property of the examinee from the examinee s offices         unless the examinee consents in writing or a court grants permission.  The commissioner may,          however, make and remove copies or abstracts of the account, record, file, document, or evidence          of transaction.                   a   The commissioner shall examine every insurer, both domestic and nondomestic,          and every licensed rate service organization, as needed and as otherwise required by law.  The          commissioner shall examine insurers, both domestic and nondomestic, no less frequently than once          every five years, but the commissioner may use  in lieu  examinations under Subsection     to          satisfy this requirement.               b   The commissioner shall revoke the certificate of authority of an insurer or the license          of a rate service organization that has not been examined, or submitted an acceptable  in lieu           report under Subsection    , within the past five years.               c   Any    persons who are policyholders, shareholders, or creditors of a domestic insurer          may by verified petition demand a hearing under Section   A       to determine whether the          commissioner should conduct an unscheduled examination of the insurer.  Persons demanding the          hearing shall be given an opportunity in the hearing to present evidence that an examination of the          insurer is necessary. If the evidence justifies an examination, the commissioner shall order one.               d   When the board of directors of a domestic insurer requests that the commissioner          examine the insurer, the commissioner shall examine the insurer as soon as reasonably possible.           If the requested examination is conducted within two years after completion of a comprehensive          examination by the commissioner, costs of the requested examination may not be deducted from          premium taxes under Section          unless the commissioner s order specifically provides for          the deduction.               e   Bail bond surety companies as defined in Section   A        are exempted from the                 five year examination requirement in Subsection     a , the revocation under Subsection     b ,         and Subsections     c  and     d .                  In lieu of all or part of an examination under Subsections     and    , or in addition to         it, the commissioner may order an independent audit or examination by technical experts,         including certified public accountants and actuaries.  Any audit or evaluation under this Subsection              is subject to Subsection    , Section   A      , and Subsection   A         .                  a   In lieu of all or any part of an examination under this section, the commissioner         may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance department of another state,         another government agency in this state, the federal government, or other state.               b   An examination by the commissioner under Subsection     or     or accepted by the          commissioner under Subsection     may use                i   an audit already made by a certified public accountant  or               ii   an actuarial evaluation made by an actuary approved by the commissioner.                   a   An examination may be comprehensive or limited with respect to the examinee s          affairs and condition.  The commissioner shall determine the nature and scope of each          examination, taking into account all relevant factors, including                i   the length of time the examinee has been licensed in this state                ii   the nature of the business being examined                iii   the nature of the accounting records available  and               iv   the nature of examinations performed elsewhere.               b   The examination of an alien insurer shall be limited to insurance transactions and assets          in the United States, unless the commissioner orders otherwise after finding that extraordinary          circumstances necessitate a broader examination.                   To effectively administer this section, the commissioner shall                a   maintain an effective financial condition surveillance system, including review of          insurance regulatory information system reports                b   employ a priority scheduling method that focuses on insurers most in need of          examination  and               c   use examination management techniques similar to those outlined in the Financial          Condition Examination Handbook of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.              Section  .  Section    A       is amended to read                         A      .  Enforcement penalties and procedures.                  a   A person who violates any insurance statute or rule or any order issued under         Subsection   A          shall forfeit to the state twice the amount of any profit gained from the         violation, in addition to any other forfeiture or penalty imposed.              b   i   The commissioner may order an individual agent, broker, adjuster, or insurance         consultant who violates an insurance statute or rule to forfeit to the state not more than   ,    for         each violation.              ii   The commissioner may order any other person who violates an insurance statute or rule         to forfeit to the state not more than   ,    for each violation.               c   i   The commissioner may order an individual agent, broker, adjuster, or insurance          consultant who violates an order issued under Subsection   A          to forfeit to the state not          more than    ,    for each violation.  Each day the violation continues is a separate violation.               ii   The commissioner may order any other person who violates an order issued under          Subsection   A          to forfeit to the state not more than   ,    for each violation.  Each day          the violation continues is a separate violation.               d   The commissioner may accept or compromise any forfeiture under this subsection until          after a complaint is filed under Subsection    . After the filing of the complaint, only the attorney          general may compromise the forfeiture.                   Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under Subsection            A         , including a forfeiture order, the commissioner may file an action in any court of          competent jurisdiction or obtain a court order or judgment                a   enforcing the commissioner s order                b   directing compliance with the commissioner s order and restraining further violation          of the order, subjecting the person ordered to the procedures and sanctions available to the court          for punishing contempt if the failure to comply continues  or               c   imposing a forfeiture in an amount the court considers just, up to    ,    for each day          the failure to comply continues after the filing of the complaint until judgment is rendered.                   The Utah Rules of Civil Procedure govern actions brought under Subsection    , except          that the commissioner may file a complaint seeking a court ordered forfeiture under Subsection              c  no sooner than two weeks after giving written notice of his intention to proceed under          Subsection     c .  The commissioner s order issued under Subsection   A          may contain                 a notice of intention to seek a court ordered forfeiture if the commissioner s order is disobeyed.                  If, after a court order is issued under Subsection    , the person fails to comply with         the commissioner s order or judgment, the commissioner may certify the fact of the failure to the         court by affidavit, and the court may, after a hearing following at least five days written notice to         the parties subject to the order or judgment, amend the order or judgment to add the forfeiture or         forfeitures, as prescribed in Subsection     c , until the person complies.                  The proceeds of all forfeitures under this section, including collection expenses, shall         be paid into the General Fund.  The expenses of collection shall be credited to the Insurance         Department s budget. The attorney general s budget shall be credited to the extent the Insurance          Department reimburses the attorney general s office for its collection expenses under this section.                   Forfeitures and judgments under this section bear interest at the rate then charged by          the United States Internal Revenue Service for past due taxes. Interest accrues from the later of the          date of entry of the commissioner s order under Subsection     or the date of judgment under          Subsection     until the forfeiture and accrued interest are fully paid.                   No forfeiture may be imposed under Subsection     c  if, at the time the forfeiture          action is commenced, the person was in compliance with the commissioner s order, or if the          violation of the order occurred during the order s suspension.                   The commissioner may seek an injunction as an alternative to issuing an order under          Subsection   A         .                   A person who intentionally violates, intentionally permits any person over whom he          has authority to violate, or intentionally aids any person in violating any insurance statute or rule          of this state or any effective order issued under Subsection   A          is guilty of a class B          misdemeanor.  Unless a specific criminal penalty is provided elsewhere in this title, the person          may be fined not more than    ,    if a corporation or not more than   ,    if a person other than          a corporation.  If the person is an individual, the person may, in addition, be imprisoned for up to          one year.  As used in this subsection,  intentionally  has the same meaning as under Subsection                     .                    When a licensee of the Insurance Department, other than a domestic insurer,          persistently or substantially violates the insurance law or violates an order of the commissioner          under Subsection   A         , if there are grounds for delinquency proceedings against the          licensee under Section   A        or Section   A       , or if the licensee s methods and                 practices in the conduct of his business endanger, or his financial resources are inadequate to         safeguard, the legitimate interests of his customers and the public, the commissioner may, after         a hearing, in whole or in part, revoke, suspend, place on probation, limit, or refuse to renew the         licensee s license or certificate of authority. Additional license termination or probation provisions         for licensees other than insurers are set forth in Sections   A       ,   A       ,   A       ,           A       ,   A       ,   A       ,   A       ,  and    A       ,   A       , and           A       .                   The enforcement penalties and procedures set forth in this section are not exclusive,         but are cumulative of other rights and remedies the commissioner has pursuant to applicable law.

Section    A        is amended to read                  A       .  Appointment and listing of insurance agents.                   As used in this section,  insurer  includes bail bond surety companies as defined in          Section   A       .                         a   An insurer shall appoint a natural person or agency that has an insurance agent          or managing general agent license to act as an insurance agent on its behalf prior to any agent          doing business for the insurer in this state.               b   All insurers shall report to the commissioner, at intervals and in the form the          commissioner establishes by rule, all new appointments and all terminations of appointments.               c   All insurers shall submit to the commissioner on or before July   of each          odd numbered year a list of all agent appointments then in force in this state.                         a   An insurer shall report to the commissioner the cause of termination of an          agent s appointment.  The information provided to the commissioner shall remain confidential.                       b   An insurer is immune from civil action, civil penalty, or damages if the insurer         complies in good faith with Subsection           in reporting to the commissioner the cause of         termination of agents  appointments.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an         insurer is not immune from any action or resulting penalty imposed on the reporting insurer as a         result of proceedings brought by or on behalf of the department if the action is based on evidence         other than the report submitted in compliance with Subsection          .                        If an insurer appoints an agency as its agent, the insurer need not appoint, report,         or pay appointment reporting fees for natural person agents designated on the agency s agent s         license under Section   A       .                         Each insurer shall maintain with the department, on forms supplied by the          department, and signed by the president and secretary of the insurer, a list of natural persons with          authority to appoint and remove the company s agents in this state.  The insurer shall submit the          reports to the commissioner pursuant to Subsection          .                         If an insurer lists a licensee as its agent in reports submitted under Subsection                   , there is a rebuttable presumption that in placing a risk with the insurer the appointed          licensee or any of the licensee s licensed employees acted as the insurer s agent and not as a broker.              Section  .  Section    A        is amended to read                  A       .  Insurer liability.

There is a rebuttable presumption that every insurer is bound by any act of its          agent performed in this state that is within the scope of the agent s actual  express or implied  or          apparent authority, until the insurer has canceled the agent s appointment  and has made reasonable          efforts to recover from the agent its policy forms and other indicia of agency.  Reasonable efforts          include a formal demand in writing for return of the indicia, and notice to the commissioner if the          agent does not promptly comply with the demand.  This Subsection     neither waives any          common law defense available to insurers, nor precludes the insured from seeking redress against          the agent individually or jointly against the insurer and agent.                         When a property liability insurance agent with authority to bind more than one          insurer on a particular risk agrees to bind coverage on a particular risk, but fails to outwardly          indicate the insurer with which the risk is placed, and before the risk is placed with a particular                  insurer a loss occurs, if there is no conclusive admissible evidence indicating the insurer with         which the agent exercised his binding authority, a court may equitably apportion the loss among         all insurers with which the agent had binding authority as to the particular type of risk.
