Forfeiture proceedings shall be commenced as follows                                  a   For actions brought  under Subsections     a  through     j   regarding property under                           Subsection    , a complaint shall be prepared by the county attorney, or if within a prosecution                            district, the district attorney, or the attorney general, and filed in a court of record where the                            property was seized or is to be seized. In cases in which the claimant of the property is also                            charged as a criminal defendant, the complaint shall be filed in the county where the criminal                               charges arose, regardless of the location of the property. The complaint shall include                                  i   a description of the property which is subject to forfeiture                                  ii   the date and place of seizure, if known  and                                 iii   the allegations of conduct by the owner which gives rise to forfeiture.                                 b   i   In cases where a claimant is also charged as a criminal defendant, the forfeiture shall                            proceed as part of the criminal prosecution as an in personam action against the defendant s                            interest in the property subject to forfeiture.  A defendant need not file a written answer to the                            complaint, but may acknowledge or deny interest in the property at the time of first appearance on                            the criminal charges.  If a criminal information or indictment is amended to include a demand for                            forfeiture, the defendant may respond to the demand at the time of the amendment.                                  i    ii   Unless a motion for disposition is made by the defendant, the determination of                            forfeiture shall be stayed until resolution of the criminal charges.  Hearing on the forfeiture shall                            be before the court  without a jury , or before a jury if a demand is submitted.  However, a jury                           trial is considered waived unless demanded.  The court may consider any evidence presented in                            the criminal case, and receive any other evidence offered by the state or the defendant.  The court                            shall  determine by a preponderance of the evidence the issues in the case and order forfeiture or                           release of the property as it determines  release the property to the claimants unless the court finds                           the state has proven the property is subject to forfeiture under this section by clear and convincing                           evidence.                                  ii    iii   A defendant may move the court to transfer the forfeiture action, to stay all                            action, including discovery, in the forfeiture, or for hearing on the forfeiture any time prior to trial                            of the criminal charges.  Either party may move the court to enter a finding of forfeiture as to                            defendant s interest in part or all of the property, either by default or by stipulation.  Upon entry                            of a finding, the court shall stay the entry of judgment until resolution of the criminal charges.                              Any finding of forfeiture entered by the court prior to resolution of the criminal charges may not                           constitute a separate judgment, and any motion for disposition, stay, severance, or transfer of the                           forfeiture action may not create a separate proceeding.  Upon the granting of a motion by the                           defendant for disposition, stay, severance, or transfer of the forfeiture action, the defendant shall                           be considered to have waived any claim that the defendant has been twice put in jeopardy for the                           same offense.                                   iii    iv   Any other person claiming an interest in property subject to forfeiture under this                               Subsection      may not intervene in a trial or appeal of a complaint filed under this subsection.
