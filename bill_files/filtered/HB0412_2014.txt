The state of Utah transportation plan for the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and                           Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest consists of all roads shown in the map                           jointly prepared by the Garfield, Iron, Kane, and Wayne County GIS departments in February                               , entitled  State of Utah Transportation Plan for Dixie National Forest,  printed copies of                           which will be maintained by the Utah Association of Counties and made available to the public                           upon request.                                     a   i   The map described in Subsection     also documents the move by Dixie                           National Forest to close and otherwise deny the public s longstanding access to many of the                           roads shown on the map in the Cedar City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts, by                           reason of the United States Forest Service s implementing a recent motorized travel plan for the                           Dixie National Forest.                                 ii   These closures and other denials of public road access through the motorized travel                           plan of the Dixie National Forest constitute an ongoing direct threat to the resources and values                           referenced in Subsection    .                                 b   The state of Utah s transportation plan for these ranger districts conflicts with the                           United States Forest Service s recent motorized travel plan for the Dixie National Forest.                                 c   The state of Utah s transportation plan for these ranger districts recognizes that all                           roads shown on the map referenced in Subsection     should be kept open to the public.                                     The state finds that keeping open to the public all roads shown on the map                           referenced in Subsection     is necessary and vital to preserve and protect the values cited in                              Subsection    .                                     The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within the Cedar                           City, Powell, Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest                                  a   fully cooperate and coordinate with the state of Utah and the respective counties in                           which these ranger districts lie, to develop, amend, and implement United States Forest Service                           land and resource management plans and transportation plans, and implement management                           decisions pursuant to those plans, that are consistent with the purposes, goals, and policies                           described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under federal law                                  b   enter into agreements regarding the maintenance, upkeep, and improvement of                           roads in these ranger districts                                  c   refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine,                           restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies as stated in this section  and                                 d   refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary to the goals and purposes                           described within this section.                                     State agencies, such as the Department of Transportation, the Department of                           Natural Resources, the Division of Wildlife Resources, the Division of Forestry, Fire, and State                           Lands, and the Department of Agriculture and Food, should also coordinate with each other,                           with counties where these zones are situated, and with applicable federal agencies to develop,                           amend, and implement policies and management decisions that are consistent with the                           purposes, goals, and policies described in this section.                                     a   The state recognizes the importance of longstanding road networks in all                           national forests in the state but establishes this transportation plan to provide special protection                           and preservation against the identified threats found to exist in the Cedar City, Powell,                           Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest.                                 b   It is the intent of the state to designate additional forest transportation plans in                           future years as circumstances warrant their special protection and preservation.                                     The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate with                           each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membership                           consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state of Utah, and local                           governments, to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management                           actions consistent with the goals and policies of this section for the Cedar City, Powell,                              Escalante, and Fremont ranger districts of the Dixie National Forest.
