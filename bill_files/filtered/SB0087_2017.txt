In all suits or actions brought under this section for the civil forfeiture of any        property, the burden of proof is on the prosecuting attorney to establish by clear and convincing        evidence  the extent to which, if any, the property is subject to forfeiture  that the claimant        engaged in conduct giving rise to the forfeiture.                  A claimant may file an answer to a complaint for civil forfeiture without posting        bond with respect to the property subject to forfeiture.                  Property is subject to forfeiture under this chapter if the prosecuting attorney        establishes that               a   the claimant has engaged in conduct giving rise to forfeiture               b   the property was acquired by the claimant during that portion of the conduct that        gives rise to forfeiture, or within a reasonable time after that conduct is committed  and              c   there is no likely source for the purchase or acquisition of the property other than        the conduct that gives rise to forfeiture.                  A finding by the court that property is the proceeds of conduct giving rise to        forfeiture does not require proof that the property was the proceeds of any particular exchange        or transaction.                   If the prosecutor establishes that the property is subject to forfeiture, but the        claimant is subsequently criminally charged with the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture and is        acquitted of that charge on the merits               a   the property subject to the forfeiture or the open market value of the property, if the        property has been disposed of under Subsection             , shall be returned to the        claimant  and              b   any payments required under this chapter regarding the costs of holding the        property shall be paid to the claimant.             Section  .  Section          is amended to read                      . Innocent owners.                  An innocent owner s interest in property may not be forfeited.                  In a forfeiture proceeding under this chapter, the prosecuting attorney has the        burden of establishing evidence that a claimant               a   is responsible for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, subject to Subsection                   b   knew of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, and allowed the property to be        used in furtherance of the conduct               c   acquired the property with notice of its actual or constructive seizure for forfeiture        under this chapter               d   acquired the property knowing the property was subject to forfeiture under this        chapter  or              e   acquired the property in an effort to conceal, prevent, hinder, or delay its lawful        seizure or forfeiture under any provision of state law.                  a   A claimant under this chapter is not required to take steps to prevent illegal use        or criminal activity regarding the property that the claimant reasonably believes would be likely        to result in physical harm or danger to any person.              b   A claimant  may demonstrate that the claimant  took reasonable action to prohibit        the illegal use of the property by               i   making a timely notification to a law enforcement agency of information that led the        claimant to know that conduct subjecting the property to seizure would occur, was occurring,        or has occurred               ii   timely revoking or attempting to revoke permission to use the property regarding        those engaging in the illegal conduct  or              iii   taking reasonable actions to discourage or prevent the illegal use of the property.                  If the state relies on Subsection     a  to establish that a claimant is not an innocent        owner, and if the claimant is criminally charged with the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture        and is acquitted of that charge on the merits               a   the property subject to the forfeiture or the open market value of the property, if the        property has been disposed of under Subsection             , shall be returned to the        claimant  and              b   any payments required under this chapter regarding holding the property shall be        paid to the claimant.                  A person may not assert under this chapter an ownership interest in contraband.                  Property is presumed to be subject to forfeiture under this chapter if the prosecuting        attorney establishes that               a   the claimant has engaged in conduct giving cause for forfeiture               b   the property was acquired by the claimant during that period of the conduct giving        cause for forfeiture or within a reasonable time after that period  and              c   there was no likely source for the purchase or acquisition of the property other than        the conduct giving cause for forfeiture.                  A finding that property is the proceeds of conduct giving cause for forfeiture does        not require proof that the property was the proceeds of any particular exchange or transaction.                  a   A claimant may recover possession of seized property that is subject to        forfeiture by contacting the seizing agency or prosecuting attorney prior to the commencement        of a civil asset forfeiture proceeding, or within    days of the seizure, whichever is longer, and        providing to the seizing agency or prosecuting attorney               i   evidence that establishes proof of ownership  and              ii   a brief description of the date, time, and place that the claimant mislaid or        relinquished possession of the seized property.              b   A seizing agency or prosecuting attorney who receives a claim from a claimant        utilizing the procedure in Subsection     a  shall issue a written response to that claim within           days of receipt, indicating whether the claim has been granted, denied on the merits, or        denied for failure to provide the information required by statute subject to the following               i   if the claim is denied for failure to provide the information required by statute, the        claimant has    days from the date of denial to submit additional information before the        prosecuting attorney may commence a civil action seeking to forfeit the property  and              ii   if the seizing agency or prosecuting attorney fails to issue a written response within           days the property shall be returned.              c   Any property returned under Subsection     b , either because the claim was        granted or because the seizing agency or prosecuting attorney failed to respond within    days        may not include any expenses, costs, or attorney fees.              d   A claimant who utilizes the procedures in Subsection     a  and whose claim is        denied on the merits by the seizing agency or prosecuting attorney, but who is later determined        by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil forfeiture action to be an innocent owner within        the meaning of Section         , may collect reasonable attorney fees and court costs from the        date on which the seizing agency or prosecuting attorney denied the claim.
