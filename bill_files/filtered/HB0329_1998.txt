As used in this section                a    Complaint  means a verified civil in rem complaint seeking forfeiture or any criminal          information or indictment which contains or is amended to include a demand for forfeiture of a          defendant s in personam interest in any property which is subject to forfeiture.               b    Drug distributing paraphernalia  means any property used or designed to be used in          the illegal transportation, storage, shipping, or circulation of a controlled substance.  Property is          considered  designed to be used  for one or more of the above listed purposes if the property has          been altered or modified to include a feature or device which would actually promote or conceal          a violation of this chapter.               c    Drug manufacturing equipment or supplies  includes any illegally possessed          controlled substance precursor, or any chemical, laboratory equipment, or laboratory supplies          possessed with intent to engage in clandestine laboratory operation as defined in Section      d  .               d    Interest holder  means a secured party as defined in Section   A          m , a           mortgagee, lien creditor, or the beneficiary of a security interest or encumbrance pertaining to an         interest in property, whose interest would be perfected against a good faith purchaser for value.          A person who holds property for the benefit of or as an agent or nominee for another, or who is         not in substantial compliance with any statute requiring an interest in property to be recorded or         reflected in public records in order to perfect the interest against a good faith purchaser for value,         is not an interest holder.              e    Proceeds  means property acquired directly or indirectly from, produced through,         realized through, or caused by an act or omission and includes any property of any kind without         reduction for expenses incurred in the acquisition, maintenance, or production of that property, or          any other purpose.               f    Resolution of criminal charges  occurs at the time a claimant who is also charged with          violations under Title   , Chapters   ,   a,   b,   c, or   d enters a plea, upon return of a jury          verdict or court ruling in a criminal trial, or upon dismissal of the criminal charge.               g    Violation of this chapter  means any conduct prohibited by Title   , Chapters   ,   a,            b,   c, or   d or any conduct occurring outside the state which would be a violation of the laws          of the place where the conduct occurred and which would be a violation of Title   , Chapters   ,            a,   b,   c, or   d if the conduct had occurred in this state.                   The following are subject to forfeiture and no property right exists in them                a   all controlled substances which have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or          acquired in violation of this chapter                b   all raw materials, products, and equipment of any kind used, or intended for use, in          manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing, or exporting any controlled          substance in violation of this chapter                c   all property used or intended for use as a container for property described in          Subsections      a  and     b                 d   all hypodermic needles, syringes, and other paraphernalia, not including capsules used          with health food supplements and herbs, used or intended for use to administer controlled          substances in violation of this chapter                e   all conveyances including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels used or intended for use, to          transport, or in any manner facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, simple possession, or          concealment of property described in Subsections     a  and     b , except that                       i   a conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in the transaction of business as         a common carrier may not be forfeited under this section unless the owner or other person in         charge of the conveyance was a consenting party or knew or had reason to know of the violation         of this chapter               ii   a conveyance may not be forfeited under this section by reason of any act or omission         committed or omitted without the owner s knowledge or consent  and              iii   any forfeiture of a conveyance is subject to the claim of an interest holder who did not         know or have reason to know after the exercise of reasonable diligence that a violation would or         did take place in the use of the conveyance                f   all books, records, and research, including formulas, microfilm, tapes, and data used          or intended for use in violation of this chapter                g   everything of value furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for a controlled          substance in violation of this chapter, and all moneys, negotiable instruments, and securities used          or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of this chapter.  An interest in property may not          be forfeited under this subsection unless it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the          interest holder knew, had reason to know of, or consented to the conduct which made the property          subject to  forfeiture.  The burden of presenting this evidence shall be upon the state                h   all imitation controlled substances as defined in Section      b  , Imitation Controlled          Substances Act                i   all warehousing, housing, and storage facilities, or interest in real property of any kind          used, or intended for use, in producing, cultivating, warehousing, storing, protecting, or          manufacturing any controlled substances in violation of this chapter, except that                i   any forfeiture of a housing, warehousing, or storage facility or interest in real property          is subject to the claim of an interest holder who did not know or have reason to know after the          exercise of reasonable diligence that a violation would take place on the property                ii   an interest in property may not be forfeited under this subsection if the interest holder          did not know or have reason to know of the conduct which made the property subject to forfeiture,          or did not willingly consent to the conduct  and               iii   unless the premises are used in producing, cultivating, or manufacturing controlled          substances, a housing, warehousing, or storage facility or interest in real property may not be          forfeited under this subsection unless cumulative sales of controlled substances on the property                 within a two month period total or exceed   ,   , or the street value of any controlled substances         found on the premises at any given time totals or exceeds   ,   .  A narcotics officer experienced         in controlled substances law enforcement may testify to establish the street value of the controlled         substances for purposes of this subsection               j   any firearm, weapon, or ammunition carried or used during or in relation to a violation         of this chapter or any firearm, weapon, or ammunition kept or located within the proximity of         controlled substances or other property subject to forfeiture under this section  and              k   all proceeds traceable to any violation of this chapter.  There is a rebuttable         presumption that all money, coins, and currency found in proximity to forfeitable controlled          substances, drug manufacturing equipment or supplies, drug distributing paraphernalia, or          forfeitable records of importation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances are          proceeds traceable to a violation of this chapter.  The burden of proof is upon the claimant of the          property to rebut this presumption.                   a   Property subject to forfeiture under this chapter may be seized by any peace officer          of this state upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the property.  However,          seizure without process may be made when                i   the seizure is incident to an arrest or search under a search warrant or an inspection          under an administrative inspection warrant                ii   the property subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor of the          state in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this chapter                iii   the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the property is directly or          indirectly dangerous to health or safety  or               iv   the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the property has been used or          intended to be used in violation of this chapter and has probable cause to believe the property will          be damaged, intentionally diminished in value, destroyed, concealed, or removed from the state.               b   Upon the filing of a complaint, the court shall immediately issue to the seizing agency          a warrant for seizure of any property subject to forfeiture which had been seized without a warrant          in a manner described in this subsection.                   In the event of seizure under Subsection    , forfeiture proceedings under Subsection               shall be instituted within    days of the seizure.  The time period may by extended by the court          having jurisdiction over the property upon notice to all claimants and interest holders and for good                 cause shown.                  Property taken or detained under this section is not repleviable but is in custody of the         law enforcement agency making the seizure, subject only to the orders and decrees of the court or         the official having jurisdiction.  When property is seized under this chapter, the appropriate person         or agency may               a   place the property under seal               b   remove the property to a place designated by it or the warrant under which it was         seized  or              c   take custody of the property and remove it to an appropriate location for disposition          in accordance with law.                   All substances listed in Schedule I that are possessed, transferred, distributed, or          offered for distribution in violation of this chapter are contraband and no property right shall exist          in them.  All substances listed in Schedule I which are seized or come into the possession of the          state may be  retained for any evidentiary or investigative purpose, including sampling or other          preservation prior to disposal or destruction by the state.                   All marijuana or any species of plants from which controlled substances in Schedules          I and II are derived which have been planted or cultivated in violation of this chapter, or of which          the owners or cultivators are unknown, or are wild growths, may be seized and retained for any          evidentiary or investigative purpose, including sampling or other preservation prior to disposal or          destruction by the state.  Failure, upon demand by the department or its authorized agent, of any          person in occupancy or in control of land or premises upon which species of plants are growing          or being stored, to produce an appropriate license or proof that he is the holder of a license, is          authority for the seizure and forfeiture of the plants.                   When any property is forfeited under this chapter by a finding of the court that no          person is entitled to recover the property, it shall be deposited in the custody of the Division of          Finance.  Disposition of all property is as follows                a   Twenty percent of all money, currency, or proceeds from the sale of forfeited property          shall be deposited with the Division of Substance Abuse within the Department of Human Services          to be used to provide drug treatment programs for children and youth.               b   The remainder of all money, currency, or proceeds from the sale of forfeited property          and any property not converted into money or currency, shall be disposed of as follows                       i   The state may include in its complaint seeking forfeiture, a request that the seizing         agency be awarded the property.  Upon a finding that the seizing agency is able to use the forfeited         property in the enforcement of controlled substances laws, the court having jurisdiction over the         case shall award the property to the seizing agency.  Each agency shall use the forfeited property         for controlled substance law enforcement purposes only.  Forfeited property or proceeds from the         sale of forfeited property may not be used to pay any cash incentive, award, or bonus to any peace         officer or individual acting as an agent for the agency, nor may it be used to supplant any ordinary         operating expense of the agency.  The seizing agency shall pay to the prosecuting agency the legal         costs incurred in filing and pursuing the forfeiture action.  Property forfeited under this section          may not be applied by the court to costs or fines assessed against any defendant in the case.                b    ii   The seizing agency, or if it makes no application, any state agency, bureau,          county, or municipality, which demonstrates a need for specific property or classes of property          subject to forfeiture shall be given the property for use in enforcement of controlled substances          laws upon the payment of costs to the county attorney or, if within a prosecution district, the          district attorney for legal costs for filing and pursuing the forfeiture and upon application for the          property to the director of the Division of Finance.  The application shall clearly set forth the need          for the property and the use to which the property will be put.                c    iii   The director of the Division of Finance shall review all applications for property          submitted under Subsection     b  ii  and, if the seizing agency makes no application, make a          determination based on necessity and advisability as to final disposition and shall notify the          designated applicant or seizing agency, where no application is made, who may obtain the property          upon payment of all costs to the appropriate department.  The Division of Finance shall in turn          reimburse the prosecuting agency or agencies for costs of filing and pursuing the forfeiture action,          not to exceed the amount of the net proceeds received for the sale of the property.  Any proceeds          remaining after payment shall be returned to the seizing agency or agencies.                d    iv   If no disposition is made upon an application under Subsection      a   b  i  or            b   ii , the director of the Division of Finance shall dispose of the property by public bidding or          as considered appropriate, by destruction.  Proof of destruction shall be upon oath of two officers          or employees of the department having charge of the property, and verified by the director of the          department or his designated agent.                   Forfeiture proceedings shall be commenced as follows                       a   For actions brought under Subsections     a  through     j , a complaint shall be         prepared by the county attorney, or if within a prosecution district, the district attorney, or the         attorney general, and filed in a court of record where the property was seized or is to be seized. In         cases in which the claimant of the property is also charged as a criminal defendant, the complaint         shall be filed in the county where the criminal charges arose, regardless of the location of the         property. The complaint shall include               i   a description of the property which is subject to forfeiture               ii   the date and place of seizure, if known  and              iii   the allegations of conduct which gives rise to forfeiture.               b   In cases where a claimant is also charged as a criminal defendant, the forfeiture shall          proceed as part of the criminal prosecution as an in personam action against the defendant s          interest in the property subject to forfeiture.  A defendant need not file a written answer to the          complaint, but may acknowledge or deny interest in the property at the time of first appearance          on the criminal charges.  If a criminal information or indictment is amended to include a demand          for forfeiture, the defendant may respond to the demand at the time of the amendment.               i   Unless motion for disposition is made by the defendant, the determination of forfeiture          shall be stayed until resolution of the criminal charges.  Hearing on the forfeiture shall be before          the court without a jury.  The court may consider any evidence presented in the criminal case, and          receive any other evidence offered by the state or the defendant.  The court shall determine by a          preponderance of the evidence the issues in the case and order forfeiture or release of the property          as it determines.               ii   A defendant may move the court to transfer the forfeiture action, to stay all action,          including discovery, in the forfeiture, or for hearing on the forfeiture any time prior to trial of the          criminal charges.  Either party may move the court to enter a finding of forfeiture as to defendant s          interest in part or all of the property, either by default or by stipulation.  Upon entry of a finding,          the court shall stay the entry of judgment until resolution of the criminal charges.  Any finding of          forfeiture entered by the court prior to resolution of the criminal charges may not constitute a          separate judgment, and any motion for disposition, stay, severance, or transfer of the forfeiture          action may not create a separate proceeding.  Upon the granting of a motion by the defendant for          disposition, stay, severance, or transfer of the forfeiture action, the defendant shall be considered          to have waived any claim that the defendant has been twice put in jeopardy for the same offense.                      iii   Any other person claiming an interest in property subject to forfeiture under this         subsection may not intervene in a trial or appeal of a complaint filed under this subsection.          Following the entry of an in personam forfeiture order, or upon the filing of a petition for release         under Subsection     e , the county attorney, district attorney, or attorney general may proceed         with a separate in rem action to resolve any other claims upon the property subject to forfeiture.              c   A complaint seeking forfeiture under Subsection     k  shall be prepared by the county         attorney, or if within a prosecution district, the district attorney, or by the attorney general, either         in personam as part of a criminal prosecution, or in a separate civil in rem action against the         property alleged to be proceeds, and filed in the county where the property is seized or          encumbered, if the proceeds are located outside the state.  A finding that property is the proceeds          of a violation of this chapter does not require proof that the property is the proceeds of any          particular exchange or transaction.  Proof that property is proceeds may be shown by evidence          which establishes all of the following by a preponderance of the evidence                i   that the person has engaged in conduct in violation of this chapter                ii   that the property was acquired by the person during that period when the conduct in          violation of this chapter occurred or within a reasonable time after that period  and               iii   that there was no likely source for the property other than conduct in violation of the          chapter.               d   Notice of the seizure and intended forfeiture shall be filed with the clerk of the court,          and served upon all persons known to the county attorney or district attorney to have a claim in          the property by                i   personal service upon a claimant who is charged in a criminal information or          indictment  and               ii   certified mail to each claimant whose name and address is known or to each owner          whose right, title, or interest is of record in the Division of Motor Vehicles to the address given          upon the records of the division, which service is considered complete even though the mail is          refused or cannot be forwarded.  The county attorney, district attorney, or  attorney general shall          make one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the seizure was          made for all other claimants whose addresses are unknown, but who are believed to have an          interest in the property.               e   Except under Subsection     a  in personam actions, any claimant  or interest holder                 shall file with the court a verified answer to the complaint within    days after service.  When         property is seized under this chapter, any interest holder or claimant of the property, prior to being         served with a complaint under this section, may file a petition in the court having jurisdiction for         release of his interest in the property.  The petition shall specify the claimant s interest in the         property and his right to have it released.  A copy shall be served upon the county attorney or, if         within a prosecution district, the district attorney in the county of the seizure, who shall answer         the petition within    days.  A petitioner need not answer a complaint of forfeiture.              f   For civil actions in rem, after    days following service of a complaint or petition for         release, the court shall examine the record and if no answer is on file, the court shall allow the          complainant or petitioner an opportunity to present evidence in support of his claim and order          forfeiture or release of the property as the court determines.  If the county attorney or district          attorney has not filed an answer to a petition for release and the court determines from the evidence          that the petitioner is not entitled to recovery of the property, it shall enter an order directing the          county attorney or district attorney to answer the petition within ten days.  If no answer is filed          within that period, the court shall order the release of the property to the petitioner entitled to          receive it.               g   When an answer to a complaint or petition appears of record at the end of    days, the          court shall set the matter for hearing.  At this hearing all interested parties may present evidence          of their rights of release of the property following the state s evidence for forfeiture.  The court          shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence the issues in the case and order forfeiture or          release of the property as it determines.               h   When the court determines that claimants have no right in the property in whole or in          part, it shall declare the property to be forfeited.               i   When the court determines that property, in whole or in part, is not subject to forfeiture,          it shall order release of the property to the proper claimant.  If the court determines that the          property is subject to forfeiture and release in part, it shall order partial release and partial          forfeiture.
