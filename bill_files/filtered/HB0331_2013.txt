Counter claims may be maintained in small claims actions if the counter claim                           arises out of the transaction or occurrence which is the subject matter of the plaintiff s claim.  A                           counter claim may not be raised for the first time in the trial de novo of the small claims action.

Claims so removed shall be rescheduled as permitted by the court s calendar.                                          Small claims matters shall be managed in accordance with simplified rules of                           procedure and evidence promulgated by the Supreme Court.
