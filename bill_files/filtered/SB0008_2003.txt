Mitigating circumstances include                            a   the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity                            b   the homicide was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental                      or emotional disturbance                            c   the defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person                            d    i    at the time of the homicide, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the                      wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of law was impaired as                              a result of a mental  illness or mental retardation  condition, intoxication, or influence of drugs                       and , except that  mental condition  under this Subsection     d  does not mean an abnormality                     manifested primarily by repeated criminal conduct                             ii   as used in Subsection     d  i                               A    mental illness  has the same definition as in Section                   and                             B    mental retardation  means a significant subaverage general intellectual functioning,                     existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior                             e   the youth of the defendant at the time of the crime                            f   the defendant was an accomplice in the homicide committed by another person and                      the defendant s participation was relatively minor  and                           g   any other fact in mitigation of the penalty.                               a   The court or jury, as the case may be, shall retire to consider the penalty.  Except                      as provided in Subsection             .        , in all proceedings before a jury, under this section, it                      shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon a unanimous decision for death and                      that the penalty of either an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which may be                      for life or life in prison without parole, shall be imposed if a unanimous decision for death is not                      found.                           b   The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the                      aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that                      total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt,                      that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.  If the                      jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall discharge the                      jury and shall impose the sentence of death.                           c   If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision imposing the sentence of death or                      the state is not seeking the death penalty, the jury shall then determine whether the penalty of life                      in prison without parole shall be imposed, except as provided in Subsection             .        .  The                      penalty of life in prison without parole shall only be imposed if the jury determines that the                      sentence of life in prison without parole is appropriate.  If the jury reports agreement by ten jurors                              or more to impose the sentence of life in prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury                      and shall impose the sentence of life in prison without parole.  If ten jurors or more do not agree                      upon a sentence of life in prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury and impose an                      indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which may be for life.                           d   If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, with the approval of                      the court and the consent of the prosecution, the court shall determine the appropriate penalty                      according to the standards of Subsections     b  and  c .                           e   If the defendant is sentenced to more than one term of life in prison with or without                      the possibility of parole, or in addition to a sentence of life in prison with or without the                      possibility of parole the defendant is sentenced for other offenses which result in terms of                      imprisonment, the judge shall determine whether the terms of imprisonment shall be imposed as                      concurrent or consecutive sentences in accordance with Section                 .                               Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate court,                      if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence of death                      and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent necessary to                      correct the error or errors. An error in the sentencing proceedings may not result in the reversal of                      the conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing proceedings, all                      exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted in the prior trial                      and sentencing proceedings are admissible in the new sentencing proceedings, and if the                      sentencing proceeding was before a                            a   jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding unless the                      defendant waives the hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the                      prosecution, in which case the proceeding shall be held according to Subsection     b  or  c , as                      applicable                            b   judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding  or                           c   judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new                      sentencing proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing                      proceeding, and the new proceeding will be before a jury unless the defendant waives the hearing                              before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecution.                               In the event the death penalty is held to be unconstitutional by the Utah Supreme                      Court or the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously                      sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the person to be brought before the court, and                      the court shall sentence the person to                            a   an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which may be for life, if                      the death penalty is held unconstitutional prior to April   ,       or                           b   life in prison without parole if the death penalty is held unconstitutional on or after                      April   ,     , and any person who is thereafter convicted of a capital felony shall be sentenced                      to an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which may be for life or life in                      prison without parole.                               a   If the appellate court s final decision regarding any appeal of a sentence of death                     precludes the imposition of the death penalty due to mental retardation or subaverage general                     intellectual functioning under Section          a        , the court having jurisdiction over a defendant                     previously sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the defendant to be brought before                     the sentencing court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to life in prison without parole.                           b   If the appellate court precludes the imposition of the death penalty under Subsection                         a , but the appellate court finds that sentencing the defendant to life in prison without parole                     is likely to result in a manifest injustice, it may remand the case to the sentencing court for                     further sentencing proceedings to determine if the defendant should serve a sentence of life in                     prison without parole or an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which may be                     for life.

If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross examine that examiner.                                a   A defendant is presumed to be not mentally retarded unless the court, by a                     preponderance of the evidence, finds the defendant to be mentally retarded.  The burden of proof                     is upon the proponent of mental retardation at the hearing.                           b   A finding of mental retardation does not operate as an adjudication of mental                     retardation for any purpose other than exempting the person from a sentence of death in the case                     before the court.                                a   The defendant is presumed not to possess the mental deficiencies listed in                     Subsection          a            unless the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, finds that the                     defendant has significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with                     significant deficiencies in adaptive functioning and that this functioning was manifested prior to                     age   .  The burden of proof is upon the proponent of that proposition.                           b   If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has                     significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with significant                     deficiencies in adaptive functioning and that this functioning was manifested prior to age   , then                     the burden is upon the state to establish that any confession by the defendant which the state                     intends to introduce into evidence is supported by substantial evidence independent of the                              confession.                                a   If the court finds the defendant mentally retarded, it shall issue an order                            i   containing findings of fact and conclusions of law, and addressing each of the factors                     in Subsections     a  and  b   and                           ii   stating that the death penalty is not a sentencing option in the case before the court.                           b   If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant possesses the                     mental deficiencies listed in Subsection          a            and that the state fails to establish that any                     confession is supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession, the state may                     proceed with its case and                            i   introduce the confession into evidence, and the death penalty will not be a sentencing                     option in the case  or                           ii   not introduce into evidence any confession or the fruits of a confession that the court                     has found is not supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession, and the death                     penalty will be a sentencing option in the case.                           c   i   A finding by the court regarding whether the defendant qualifies for an exemption                     under Section          a         is a final determination of that issue for purposes of this chapter.                           ii   The following questions may not be submitted to the jury by instruction, special                     verdict, argument, or other means                            A   whether the defendant is mentally retarded for purposes of this chapter  and                           B   whether the defendant possesses the mental deficiencies specified in Subsection                             a           .                           iii   This chapter does not prevent the defendant from submitting evidence of retardation                     or other mental deficiency to establish a mental condition as a mitigating circumstance under                     Section                 .                                A ruling by the court that the defendant is exempt from the death penalty may be                     appealed by the state pursuant to Subsection          a          h .

If the defendant files notice, raises the issue, or intends to present evidence or make                     an argument that the defendant is exempt from the death penalty under this chapter, the defendant                     shall make himself available and fully cooperate in any examination by mental health experts                     appointed by the Department of Human Services and any other independent examiners for the                     defense or the prosecution.                               If the defendant wilfully fails to make himself available and fully cooperate in the                     examination, and that failure is established to the satisfaction of the court, the defendant is barred                     from presenting expert testimony relating to any exemption from the death penalty under this                     chapter.
