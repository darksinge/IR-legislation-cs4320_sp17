As used in this section,  hemp extract  means an extract from a cannabis plant, or a                           mixture or preparation containing cannabis plant material, that                                  a   is composed of less than  .   tetrahydrocannabinol by weight  and                                 b   contains no other psychoactive substance.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an individual who possesses                           hemp extract lawfully under Subsection     and administers hemp extract to a minor is not                           subject to the penalties described in this chapter for administering the hemp extract to the                           minor if                                  a   the individual is the minor s parent or legal guardian  and                                 b   the individual is registered with the Department of Health as the minor s parent                           under Section                  .                                Section  .   Effective date.                                This bill takes effect on July  ,     .      Legislative Review Note      as of                PM   The Utah Legislature s Joint Rule         requires legislative general counsel to place a    legislative review note on legislation. The Legislative Management Committee has further  directed legislative general counsel to include legal analysis in the legislative review note only  if legislative general counsel determines there is a high probability that a court would declare  the legislation to be unconstitutional under the Utah Constitution, the United States  Constitution, or both. As explained in the legal analysis below, legislative general counsel has  determined, based on applicable state and federal constitutional language and current  interpretations of that language in state and federal court case law, that this legislation has a  high probability of being declared unconstitutional by a court.   This bill      defines hemp extract as an extract of the cannabis plant or a mixture containing  cannabis plant material that contains less than  .   tetrahydrocannabinol by weight and  contains no other psychoactive substance      gives the Utah Department of Health the  authority to issue authorization cards to individuals who, based on a statement from a  physician, could benefit from treatment by hemp extract or to individuals caring for a minor  who, based on a statement from a physician, could benefit from treatment by hemp extract       allows an authorized individual to use or possess hemp extract  and     allows an authorized  individual to administer hemp extract to a minor.   The federal Controlled Substances Act defines  marihuana  as  all parts of the plant Cannabis  sativa L., whether growing or not,  and only exempts a compound or other mixture made from  the  mature stalks  or sterilized seeds of the plant.     U.S.C.                 .  The act lists  marihuana as a controlled substance and makes it illegal to possess a controlled substance  without a prescription, or to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute the  substance.  Id. at       ,    .    Under the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court has  long  recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.   Altira Group v.  Good,     U.S.          .  Federal law limits preemption under the federal Controlled  Substances Act to those cases where a  positive conflict  exists between the Act and a state  law, such that it is impossible for a party to comply with both state and federal requirements.  See    U.S.C.        Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine,     U.S.   ,          .   Under the definition used in this bill, substances that meet the bill s definition of hemp extract  need not be made exclusively from the mature stalks or sterilized seeds of the cannabis plant,  and therefore are likely to be considered  marihuana  under the federal Controlled Substances  Act.  Any substance that meets the federal Controlled Substances Act s definition of marihuana  will trigger the possession and distribution prohibitions contained in the Act.  An individual  possessing or using hemp extract or administering hemp extract to a minor likely could not  comply with the provisions of this bill without also violating federal law, creating a positive  conflict with the bill and federal law.  That positive conflict results in a high probability that a  court will hold that the bill is preempted by federal law and unconstitutional under the  Supremacy Clause.
