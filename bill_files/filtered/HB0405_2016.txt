Section         .  is amended to read                     . .  Enhanced penalty for certain offenses committed by prisoner.                 As used in this section,  serving a sentence  means a prisoner is sentenced and       committed to the custody of the Department of Corrections, the sentence has not been       terminated or voided, and the prisoner              a   has not been paroled  or             b   is in custody after arrest for a parole violation.                 If the trier of fact finds beyond a reasonable doubt that a prisoner serving a sentence       for a capital felony or a first degree felony commits any offense listed in Subsection          ,       the court shall sentence the defendant to life in prison without parole.   However,                  Notwithstanding Subsection    , the court may sentence the defendant to an       indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and  which  that may be for life if the court       finds that the interests of justice would best be served and states the specific circumstances       justifying the disposition on the record.                 Subsection     does not apply if the prisoner is younger than    years of age at the       time the offense listed in Subsection     is committed.                       Offenses referred to in Subsection     are              a   aggravated assault,  Subsection  Section                            b   mayhem, Section                       c   attempted murder, Section                       d   kidnapping, Section                       e   child kidnapping, Section         .               f   aggravated kidnapping, Section                       g   rape, Section                       h   rape of a child, Section         .               i   object rape, Section         .               j   object rape of a child, Section         .               k   forcible sodomy, Section                       l   sodomy on a child, Section         .               m   aggravated sexual abuse of a child, Section         .               n   aggravated sexual assault, Section                       o   aggravated arson, Section                       p   aggravated burglary, Section           and             q   aggravated robbery, Section         .                       The sentencing enhancement described in this section does not apply if              a   the offense for which the person is being sentenced is              i   a grievous sexual offense              ii   child kidnapping, Section         .   or             iii   aggravated kidnapping, Section           and             b   applying the sentencing enhancement provided for in this section would result in a       lower maximum penalty than the penalty provided for under the section that describes the       offense for which the person is being sentenced.            Section  .  Section          is amended to read                     . Capital felony    Penalties.                 A person who has pled guilty to or been convicted of a capital felony shall be       sentenced in accordance with this section and Section         .   That sentence shall be death,       an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which may be for life, or, on or after       April   ,     , life in prison without parole.                  a   If the person described in Subsection     was    years of age or older at the time       the offense was committed, the sentence shall be              i   death              ii   an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and that may be for life  or             iii   on or after April   ,     , life in prison without parole.             b   Subsections     a  i  and     a  iii  do not apply if the person was younger than          years of age at the time the offense was committed.                       a   The judgment of conviction and sentence of death is subject to automatic       review by the Utah State Supreme Court within    days after certification by the sentencing       court of the entire record unless time is extended an additional period not to exceed    days by       the Utah State Supreme Court for good cause shown.             b   The review by the Utah State Supreme Court has priority over all other cases and       shall be heard in accordance with rules promulgated by the Utah State Supreme Court.            Section  .  Section          is amended to read                     . Capital felony    Sentencing proceeding.                 a   When a defendant has pled guilty to or been found guilty of a capital felony,        there shall be further proceedings before the court or jury on the issue of sentence.              b   In the case of a plea of guilty to a capital felony, the sentencing proceedings shall        be conducted before a jury or, upon request of the defendant and with the approval of the court        and the consent of the prosecution, by the court which accepted the plea.              c   i   When a defendant has been found guilty of a capital felony, the proceedings        shall be conducted before the court or jury which found the defendant guilty, provided the        defendant may waive hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of        the prosecution, in which event the hearing shall be before the court.              ii   If circumstances make it impossible or impractical to reconvene the same jury for        the sentencing proceedings, the court may dismiss that jury and convene a new jury for the        proceedings.              d   If a retrial of the sentencing proceedings is necessary as a consequence of a remand        from an appellate court, the sentencing authority shall be determined as provided in Subsection           .                  a   In capital sentencing proceedings, evidence may be presented on               i   the nature and circumstances of the crime               ii   the defendant s character, background, history, and mental and physical condition               iii   the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim s family and community        without comparison to other persons or victims  and              iv   any other facts in aggravation or mitigation of the penalty that the court considers        relevant to the sentence.              b   Any evidence the court considers to have probative force may be received        regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence.  The state s attorney and        the defendant shall be permitted to present argument for or against the sentence of death.                  Aggravating circumstances include those outlined in Section         .                  Mitigating circumstances include               a   the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity               b   the homicide was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental        or emotional disturbance               c   the defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person               d   at the time of the homicide, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the        wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirement of law was impaired        as a result of a mental condition, intoxication, or influence of drugs, except that  mental        condition  under this Subsection     d  does not mean an abnormality manifested primarily by        repeated criminal conduct               e   the youth of the defendant at the time of the crime               f   the defendant was an accomplice in the homicide committed by another person and        the defendant s participation was relatively minor  and              g   any other fact in mitigation of the penalty.                  a   The court or jury, as the case may be, shall retire to consider the penalty.  Except        as provided in  Subsection  Subsections         .     and             b , in all proceedings        before a jury, under this section, it shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon        a unanimous decision for death and that the penalty of either an indeterminate prison term of        not less than    years and which may be for life or life in prison without parole, shall be        imposed if a unanimous decision for death is not found.              b   The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the        aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that        total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable        doubt, that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.         If the jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall        discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of death.              c   If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision imposing the sentence of death,        the jury shall then determine whether the penalty of life in prison without parole shall be        imposed, except as provided in Subsection         .    .  The penalty of life in prison without        parole shall only be imposed if the jury determines that the sentence of life in prison without        parole is appropriate.  If the jury reports agreement by    jurors or more to impose the sentence        of life in prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence        of life in prison without parole.  If    jurors or more do not agree upon a sentence of life in        prison without parole, the court shall discharge the jury and impose an indeterminate prison        term of not less than    years and which may be for life.              d   If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, with the approval        of the court and the consent of the prosecution, the court shall determine the appropriate        penalty according to the standards of Subsections     b  and  c .              e   If the defendant is sentenced to more than one term of life in prison with or without        the possibility of parole, or in addition to a sentence of life in prison with or without the        possibility of parole the defendant is sentenced for other offenses which result in terms of        imprisonment, the judge shall determine whether the terms of imprisonment shall be imposed        as concurrent or consecutive sentences in accordance with Section         .                  Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate        court, if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence        of death and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent        necessary to correct the error or errors.  An error in the sentencing proceedings may not result        in the reversal of the conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing        proceedings, all exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted        in the prior trial and sentencing proceedings are admissible in the new sentencing proceedings,        and if the sentencing proceeding was before a               a   jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding unless the        defendant waives the hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of        the prosecution, in which case the proceeding shall be held according to Subsection     b  or         c , as applicable               b   judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding  or              c   judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new        sentencing proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing        proceeding, and the new proceeding will be before a jury unless the defendant waives the        hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecution.                  If the penalty of death is held to be unconstitutional by the Utah Supreme Court or        the United States Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously        sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the person to be brought before the court, and        the court shall sentence the person to life in prison without parole.                  a   If the appellate court s final decision regarding any appeal of a sentence of death        precludes the imposition of the death penalty due to mental retardation or subaverage general        intellectual functioning under Section      a    , the court having jurisdiction over a        defendant previously sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause the defendant to be        brought before the sentencing court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to life in prison        without parole.              b   If the appellate court precludes the imposition of the death penalty under        Subsection     a , but the appellate court finds that sentencing the defendant to life in prison        without parole is likely to result in a manifest injustice, it may remand the case to the        sentencing court for further sentencing proceedings to determine if the defendant should serve        a sentence of life in prison without parole or an indeterminate prison term of not less than           years and which may be for life.             Section  .  Section         .  is amended to read                      . . Applicability    Effect on sentencing    Options of offenders.                  a   The sentencing option of life without parole provided in Sections          and                 applies only to those capital felonies for which the offender was    years of age or        older at the time the offense was committed and is sentenced on or after April   ,     .              b   The sentencing option of life without parole provided in Sections          and                 has no effect on sentences imposed in capital cases prior to April   ,     .                  An offender, who commits a capital felony prior to April   ,     , but is sentenced        on or after April   ,     , shall be given the option, prior to a sentencing hearing pursuant to        Section         , to proceed either under the law which was in effect at the time the offense        was committed or under the additional sentencing option of life in prison without parole        provided in Sections          and         .                  Notwithstanding any provision of this title, an offender may not be sentenced to life        without parole if the offender is younger than    years of age at the time the offense was        committed.             Section  .  Section         .  is amended to read                      . . First degree felony aggravated murder    Noncapital felony           Penalties    Sentenced by court.                  A person who has pled guilty to or been convicted of first degree felony aggravated        murder under Section          shall be sentenced by the court.                  a   The sentence under this section shall be               i   life in prison without parole  or              ii  an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and  which  that may be for        life.              b   Subsection     a  i  does not apply if the person was younger than    years of age        at the time the offense was committed.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
