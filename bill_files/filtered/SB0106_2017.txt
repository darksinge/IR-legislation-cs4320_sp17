The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such        proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.

A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or        liabilities incurred during the period of default.              .  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other        means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate        shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the        defaulting state s legislature, and each of the Compact States.              .

The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be        in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing        between the Commission and the defaulting state.              .  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the        U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its        principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including        reasonable attorney s fees.             C.  Dispute Resolution              .  Upon request by a Compact State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes        related to the Compact which arise among Compact States and between Compact and        Non Compact States.              .  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding        dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the Commission.             D.  Enforcement              .  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the        provisions and Rules of this Compact.              .  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court        for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices        against a Compact State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact        and its promulgated Rules and Bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and        damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be        awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney s fees.              .  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The        Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.

Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers        necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.             B.  Any state which joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission s initial adoption        of the Rules shall be subject to the Rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact        becomes law in that state. Any rule which has been previously adopted by the Commission        shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.             C.  Any Compact State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute        repealing the same.              .  A Compact State s withdrawal shall not take effect until six     months after        enactment of the repealing statute.              .  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State s        Psychology Regulatory Authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting        requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.             D.  Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any        psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Compact State        and a Non Compact State which does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.             E.  This Compact may be amended by the Compact States.
