                              b   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian traffic control signal under Section                                 a        , a pedestrian facing a steady red signal alone may not enter the roadway.                                 c   i   Except when facing a red arrow signal or when a sign is in place prohibiting a                            turn, the operator of a vehicle facing any steady circular red signal may cautiously enter the                            intersection to turn right, or may turn left from a one way street into a one way street, after                            stopping as required by Subsection     a .                                 ii   The operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to                                  A

adjacent crosswalk.                                     a   This section applies to a highway or rail line where a traffic control signal is                            erected and maintained.                                 b   Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the highway pavement                            indicating where the stop shall be made, but, in the absence of any sign or marking, the stop                            shall be made at the signal.                                     The operator of a vehicle approaching an intersection that has an inoperative                            traffic control signal shall                                  a   stop before entering the intersection  and                                 b   yield the right of way to any vehicle as required under Section         a        .                                     a   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of Subsection     a  if an operator of a                           motorcycle, moped, or bicycle facing a steady circular red signal or red arrow                                  i   brings the motorcycle, moped, or bicycle to a complete stop at the intersection or                              stop line                                  ii   determines that                                  A   the traffic control signal has not detected the operator s presence by waiting a                           reasonable period of time at the intersection or stop line before entering the intersection                                  B   no other vehicle that is entitled to have the right of way under applicable law is                           sitting at, traveling through, or approaching the intersection  and                                 C   no pedestrians are attempting to cross at or near the intersection in the direction of                           travel of the operator  and                                 iii   cautiously enters the intersection and proceeds across the roadway.                                 b   The affirmative defense under this section does not apply at an active railroad grade                           crossing as defined in Section         a         .
