violence                             it is the finding of the Legislature that domestic violence crimes  as defined in Section                                             are crimes for which bail may be denied if there is substantial evidence to support the charge                             and if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged perpetrator would                            constitute a substantial danger to an alleged victim of domestic violence if released on bail       Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM   Office of Legislative Research and
