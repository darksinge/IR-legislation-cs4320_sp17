When a decree of divorce is rendered, the court may include in it equitable orders relating        to the children, property, debts or obligations, and parties.  The court shall include the following in        every decree of divorce              a   an order assigning responsibility for the payment of reasonable and necessary medical        and dental expenses of the dependent children              b   if coverage is or becomes available at a reasonable cost, an order requiring the purchase        and maintenance of appropriate health, hospital, and dental care insurance for the dependent        children              c   pursuant to Section       .               i   an order specifying which party is responsible for the payment of joint debts, obligations,        or liabilities of the parties contracted or incurred during marriage              ii   an order requiring the parties to notify respective creditors or obligees, regarding the        court s division of debts, obligations, or liabilities and regarding the parties  separate, current        addresses  and             iii   provisions for the enforcement of these orders  and             d   provisions for income withholding in accordance with Title   A, Chapter   ,  Parts          and    and  Recovery Services.              e   with regard to child support orders issued or modified on or after January  ,     , that        are subject to income withholding, an order assessing against the obligor an additional    per month        check processing fee to be included in the amount withheld and paid to the Office of Recovery        Services within the Department of Human Services for the purposes of income withholding in        accordance with Title   A, Chapter   , Parts   and  .                  The court may include, in an order determining child support, an order assigning        financial responsibility for all or a portion of child care expenses incurred on behalf of the dependent        children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.  If the court determines                 that the circumstances are appropriate and that the dependent children would be adequately cared        for, it may include an order allowing the noncustodial parent to provide child care for the dependent        children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.                 The court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for the        custody of the children and their support, maintenance, health, and dental care, and for distribution        of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary.                 a   In determining visitation rights of parents, grandparents, and other members of the        immediate family, the court shall consider the best interest of the child.             b   Upon a specific finding by the court of the need for peace officer enforcement, the court        may include in an order establishing a visitation schedule a provision, among other things,        authorizing any peace officer to enforce a court ordered visitation schedule entered under this        chapter.                 If a petition for modification of child custody or visitation provisions of a court order is        made and denied, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the reasonable attorneys  fees expended        by the prevailing party in that action, if the court determines that the petition was without merit and        not asserted or defended against in good faith.                 If a petition alleges substantial noncompliance with a visitation order by a parent, a        grandparent, or other member of the immediate family pursuant to Section         .  where a        visitation right has been previously granted by the court, the court may award to the prevailing party        costs, including actual attorney fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing party because of the        other party s failure to provide or exercise court ordered visitation.                 a   The court shall consider at least the following factors in determining alimony              i   the financial condition and needs of the recipient spouse              ii   the recipient s earning capacity or ability to produce income              iii   the ability of the payor spouse to provide support  and             iv   the length of the marriage.             b   The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining alimony.             c   As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at the time of                 separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection  a .  However, the court shall        consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion, base alimony on the        standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short duration, when no children        have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider the standard of living that        existed at the time of the marriage.             d   The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the parties         respective standards of living.             e   When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major change in the        income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change shall be considered        in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony.  If one spouse s earning        capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses during the marriage, the court        may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital property and awarding alimony.             f   In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no children have        been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring each party to the        condition which existed at the time of the marriage.             g   i   The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new orders        regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not  forseeable         foreseeable at the time of the divorce.             ii   The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address needs of        the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court finds extenuating        circumstances that justify that action.             iii   In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not be        considered, except as provided in this subsection.             A   The court may consider the subsequent spouse s financial ability to share living        expenses.             B   The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that the        payor s improper conduct justifies that consideration.             h   Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years that the                 marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony,  the court finds extenuating        circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.                 Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court that        a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage of that former        spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void  ab initio, payment of alimony        shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the action of annulment and his rights        are determined.                 Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates upon        establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with another        person.            Section  .  Section        .  is amended to read                    . .  Provision for income withholding in child support order.            Whenever a court enters an order for child support, it shall include in the order a provision        for withholding income as a means of collecting child support as provided in Title   A, Chapter   ,         Part  , Income Withholding  Recovery Services.            Section  .  Section         .  is amended to read                     . .  Payment under child support order    Judgment.                 Each payment or installment of child or spousal support under any child support order,        as defined by  Subsection  Section   A            , is, on and after the date it is due              a   a judgment with the same attributes and effect of any judgment of a district court, except        as provided in Subsection                  b   entitled, as a judgment, to full faith and credit in this and in any other jurisdiction  and             c   not subject to retroactive modification by this or any other jurisdiction, except as        provided in Subsection    .                 A child or spousal support payment under a child support order may be modified with        respect to any period during which a petition for modification is pending, but only from the date        notice of that petition was given to the obligee, if the obligor is the petitioner, or to the obligor, if        the obligee is the petitioner.                          For purposes of this section,  jurisdiction  means a state or political subdivision, a        territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of        Puerto Rico.                 The judgment provided for in Subsection     a , to be effective and enforceable as a lien        against the real property interest of any third party relying on the public record, shall be docketed        in the district court in accordance with Sections         and    A           A       . .

In cases where there has been an overpayment of any tax imposed by this chapter, the        amount of overpayment is credited as follows              a   against any income tax then due from the taxpayer              b   against                       i   the amount of any judgment against the taxpayer, including one ordering the payment of        a fine or of restitution to a victim under Section         , obtained through due process of law by        any entity of state government  or              c   against   ii  any child support obligation which is delinquent, as determined by the        Office of Recovery Services in the Department of Human Services , in enforcing, under Title IV D        of the Social Security Act, a court or administrative order for support of a child which has not been        reduced to judgment,  and after notice and an opportunity for  a hearing  an adjudicative proceeding,        as provided in Subsection                   d    c   as bail, to ensure the appearance of the taxpayer before the appropriate authority to        resolve an outstanding warrant against the taxpayer for which bail is due, if a court of competent        jurisdiction has not approved an alternative form of payment.  This bail may be applied to any fine        or forfeiture which is due and related to a warrant which is outstanding on or after February   ,            , and in accordance with Subsections     and    .                 a   Subsection      c    b  ii  may be exercised only if the Office of Recovery Services         serves prior  has mailed written notice  on  to the  taxpayer by personal service or certified mail,        restricted delivery  taxpayer s last known address or the address on file under Section   A       . ,        stating              i   the amount of child support  which is alleged to be delinquent  that is past due as of the        date of the notice or other specified date   and              ii   that  the  any overpayment shall be applied to reduce  that alleged  the amount of        past due child support  debt unless the taxpayer appears at an administrative hearing before the        department and successfully contests the child support debt or the application of the overpayment        to that debt.  specified in the notice  and             iii   that the taxpayer may contest the amount of past due child support specified in the        notice by filing a written request for an adjudicative proceeding with the office within    days of the        notice being sent.             b   If an overpayment of tax is credited against a  delinquent  past due child support        obligation in accordance with Subsection      c    b  ii  in  non AFDC  noncash assistance cases,                 the Office of Recovery Services shall inform the  non AFDC custodial parent  obligee parent in        advance if it will first use any portion of the overpayment to satisfy unreimbursed  AFDC  cash        assistance or foster care maintenance payments which have been provided to that family.             c   The Department of Human Services shall establish rules to implement this subsection,        including procedures, in accordance with the other provisions of this section, to ensure prompt        reimbursement to the taxpayer of any amount of an overpayment of taxes which was credited against        a child support obligation in error, and to ensure prompt distribution of properly credited funds to        the  custodial  obligee parent.                 Subsection      d    c  may be exercised only if              a   a court has issued a warrant for the arrest of the taxpayer for failure to post bail, appear,        or otherwise satisfy the terms of a citation, summons, or court order  and             b   a notice of intent to apply the overpayment as bail on the issued warrant has been mailed        to the person s current address on file with the commission.                 a   The commission shall deliver the overpayment applied as bail to the court that issued        the warrant of arrest.  The clerk of the court is authorized to endorse the check or commission        warrant of payment on behalf of the payees and deposit the monies in the court treasury.             b   The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the warrant        for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the taxpayer is not        required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar amount of bail.  In        all other cases, the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not required to order the        withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the    day period, and the taxpayer may        be arrested on the warrant.  However, the bail amount shall be reduced by the amount of tax        overpayment received by the court.             c   If the taxpayer fails to respond to the notice described in Subsection    , or to resolve the        warrant within    days after the mailing under that subsection, the overpayment applied as bail is        forfeited and notice of the forfeiture shall be mailed to the taxpayer at the current address on file with        the commission.  The court may then issue another warrant or allow the original warrant to remain        in force if                       i   the taxpayer has not complied with an order of the court              ii   the taxpayer has failed to appear and respond to a criminal charge for which a personal        appearance is required  or             iii   the taxpayer has paid partial but not full bail in a case for which a personal appearance        is not required.                 If the alleged violations named in the warrant are later resolved in favor of the taxpayer,        the bail amount shall be remitted to the taxpayer.                 Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.                 a   If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld from        wages exceeds the actual tax due, no refund or credit may be made or allowed unless the taxpayer        or his legal representative files with the commission a tax return claiming the refund or credit              i   within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension of time        for filing the return  or             ii   within two years from the date the tax was paid, whichever period is later.             b   In other instances where a refund or credit of tax which has not been deducted and        withheld from income is due, no credit or refund may be allowed or made after three years from the        time the tax was paid, unless, before the expiration of the period, a claim is filed by the taxpayer or        his legal representative.                 The fine and bail forfeiture provisions of this section apply to all warrants and fines        issued in cases charging the taxpayer with a felony, a misdemeanor, or an infraction described in this        section which are outstanding on or after February   ,     .                 If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds the tax        to which the credit relates, the excess is considered an overpayment.                  A claim for credit or refund of an overpayment which is attributable to the application        to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years from the time the        return was due for the taxable year of the loss.                  If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and        withheld under Section          , a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the                 amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.                  If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax, the        amount is an overpayment.                  If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable period of        limitation, that amount is an overpayment.                  a   If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable income        reported on his federal income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is treated in the        same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes, or to file an amended        return with the commission, a claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall        be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the date the notice of the change, correction, or        amended return was required to be filed with the commission.             b   If the report or amended return is not filed within    days, interest on any resulting        refund or credit ceases to accrue after the    day period.             c   The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax        attributable to the federal change, correction, or items amended on the taxpayer s amended federal        income tax return.             d   Except as specifically provided, this section does not affect the amount or the time within        which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.                  No credit or refund may be allowed or made if the overpayment is less than   .                  The amount of the credit or refund may not exceed the tax paid during the three years        immediately preceding the filing of the claim, or if no claim is filed, then during the three years        immediately preceding the allowance of the credit or refund.                  In the case of an overpayment of tax by the employer under the withholding provisions        of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the amount        of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the provisions of this chapter.                  If a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund under this chapter dies, the commission may        make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer s estate.  If there is        no executor or administrator, payment may be made to those persons who establish entitlement to                 inherit the property of the decedent in the proportions set out in Title   , Uniform Probate Code.                  Where an overpayment relates to adjustments to net income referred to in Subsection                      c , credit may be allowed or a refund paid any time before the expiration of the period        within which a deficiency may be assessed.

In a proceeding to modify an existing award, consideration of natural or adoptive        children other than those in common to both parties may be applied to mitigate an increase in the        award but may not be applied to justify a decrease in the award.                  With regard to child support orders, enactment of the guidelines and any subsequent        change in the guidelines constitutes a substantial or material change of circumstances as a ground        for modification or adjustment of a court order, if there is a difference of at least     between the        existing order and the guidelines.

If there is a difference of     or more                 and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the court shall adjust the amount to that which is        provided for in the guidelines.             c   A showing of a substantial change in circumstances is not necessary for an adjustment        under Subsection     b .                 a   A parent, legal guardian, or the office may at any time petition the court to adjust the        amount of a child support order if there has been a substantial change in circumstances.             b   For purposes of Subsection     a , a substantial change in circumstances may include              i   material changes in custody              ii   material changes in the relative wealth or assets of the parties              iii   material changes of     or more in the income of a parent              iv   material changes in the ability of a parent to earn              v   material changes in the medical needs of the child  and             vi   material changes in the legal responsibilities of either parent for the support of others.             c   Upon receiving a petition under Subsection     a , the court shall, taking into account        the best interests of the child, determine whether a substantial change has occurred.  If it has, the        court shall then determine whether the change results in a difference of     or more between the        amount of child support ordered and the amount that would be required under the guidelines.  If        there is such a difference and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the court shall adjust the        amount of child support ordered to that which is provided for in the guidelines.

A child support order based on the voluntary declaration of paternity remains in        effect during the pendency of any proceeding under this section, and until a final order of the court        rescinding the voluntary declaration.                       If the declaration is rescinded, the declarant father may not recover any child        support he provided for the child before entry of the order of rescission.             Section   .

Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.                 A tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has        continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a child support order              a   as long as this state remains the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the        child for whose benefit the support order is issued  or             b   until  each individual party has  all of the parties who are individuals have filed written         consent  consents with the tribunal of this state for a tribunal of another state to modify the order        and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.                 A tribunal of this state issuing a child support order consistent with the law of this state        may not exercise its continuing jurisdiction to modify the order if the order has been modified by        a tribunal of another state pursuant to a law substantially similar to this chapter.                 If a child support order of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant        to a law substantially similar to this chapter, a tribunal of this state loses its continuing, exclusive        jurisdiction with regard to prospective enforcement of the order issued in this state, and may only              a   enforce the order that was modified as to amounts accruing before the modification              b   enforce nonmodifiable aspects of that order  and             c   provide other appropriate relief for violations of that order which occurred before the        effective date of the modification.                 A tribunal of this state shall recognize the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal                  of another state which has issued a child support order pursuant to a law substantially similar to this        chapter.                 A temporary support order issued ex parte or pending resolution of a jurisdictional        conflict does not create continuing, exclusive jurisdiction in the issuing tribunal.                 A tribunal of this state issuing a support order consistent with the law of this state has        continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal support order throughout the existence of the        support obligation.  A tribunal of this state may not modify a spousal support order issued by a        tribunal of another state having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over that order under the law of        that state.            Section   .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read                    a     .           f    .  Enforcement and modification of support order by         tribunal having continuing jurisdiction.                 A tribunal of this state may serve as an initiating tribunal to request a tribunal of another        state to enforce or modify a support order issued in that state.                 A tribunal of this state having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a support order may        act as a responding tribunal to enforce or modify the order.  If a party subject to the continuing,        exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal no longer resides in the issuing state, in subsequent proceedings        the tribunal may apply Section       a           f     to receive evidence from another state and        Section       a           f     to obtain discovery through a tribunal of another state.                 A tribunal of this state which lacks continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over a spousal        support order may not serve as a responding tribunal to modify a spousal support order of another        state.

Recognition of controlling child support order.                  If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and one or more child support orders have        been issued in this or another state with regard to an obligor and a child, a tribunal of this state shall                  apply the following rules in determining which order to recognize for purposes of continuing,        exclusive jurisdiction.               a   If only one tribunal has issued a child support order, the order of that tribunal must be        recognized.               b   If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child,        and only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the        order of that tribunal must be recognized.               c   If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child,        and more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter,        an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child must be recognized, but if an order        has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued must be        recognized.               d   If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child,        and none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the        tribunal of this state may issue a child support order, which must be recognized.                   The tribunal that has issued an order recognized under Subsection     is the tribunal        having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.                  If a proceeding is brought under this chapter and only one tribunal has issued a child        support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.                 If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and two or more child support orders have        been issued by tribunals of this state or another state with regard to the same obligor and child, a        tribunal of this state shall apply the following rules in determining which order to recognize for        purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction              a   If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this        chapter, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized.             b   If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this        chapter, an order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls and must be so        recognized, but if an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most                  recently issued controls and must be so recognized.             c   If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter,        the tribunal of this state having jurisdiction over the parties shall issue a child support order, which        controls and must be so recognized.                 If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and child and        if the obligor or the individual obligee resides in this state, a party may request a tribunal of this state        to determine which order controls and must be so recognized under Subsection    .  The request        must be accompanied by a certified copy of every support order in effect.  The requesting party shall        give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.                 The tribunal that issued the controlling order under Subsection    ,    , or     is the        tribunal that has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under Section      f    .                 A tribunal of this state which determines by order the identity of the controlling order        under Subsection     a  or  b  or which issues a new controlling order under Subsection     c  shall        state in that order the basis upon which the tribunal made its determination.                 Within    days after issuance of an order determining the identity of the controlling        order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it with each tribunal that issued or        registered an earlier order of child support.  A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified        copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The        failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.            Section   .

In responding to multiple registrations or petitions for enforcement of two or more child        support orders in effect at the same time with regard to the same obligor and different individual        obligees, at least one of which was issued by a tribunal of another state, a tribunal of this state shall        enforce those orders in the same manner as if the multiple orders had been issued by a tribunal of        this state.

Attorney s fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly        to the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney s own name.  Payment of support owed        to the obligee has priority over fees, costs, and expenses.                 The tribunal shall order the payment of costs and reasonable attorneys  fees if it        determines that a hearing was requested primarily for delay.  In a proceeding under Part   a hearing        is presumed to have been requested primarily for delay if a registered support order is confirmed or        enforced without change.

Limited immunity of petitioner.                 Participation by a petitioner in a proceeding before a responding tribunal, whether in        person, by private attorney, or through services provided by the support enforcement agency, does        not confer personal jurisdiction over the petitioner in another proceeding.                           A petitioner is not amenable to service of civil process while physically present in this        state to participate in a proceeding under this chapter.                 The immunity granted by this section does not extend to civil litigation based on acts        unrelated to a proceeding under this chapter committed by a party while present in this state to        participate in the proceeding.

Section       f     is enacted to read                   f    .  Special rules of evidence and procedure.                 The physical presence of the petitioner in a responding tribunal of this state is not        required for the establishment, enforcement, or modification of a support order or the rendition of        a judgment determining parentage.                 A verified petition, affidavit, or document substantially complying with federally        mandated forms, and a document incorporated by reference in any of them, not excluded under the        hearsay rule if given in person, is admissible in evidence if given under oath by a party or witness        residing in another state.                 A copy of the record of child support payments certified as a true copy of the original        by the custodian of the record may be forwarded to a responding tribunal.  The copy is evidence of        facts asserted in it and is admissible to show whether payments were made.                 Copies of bills for testing for parentage, and for prenatal and postnatal health care of the        mother and child, furnished to the adverse party at least ten days before trial, are admissible in        evidence to prove the amount of the charges billed and that the charges were reasonable, necessary,        and customary.                 Documentary evidence transmitted from another state to a tribunal of this state by        telephone, telecopier, or other means that do not provide an original writing may not be excluded                  from evidence on an objection based on the means of transmission.                 In a proceeding under this chapter, a tribunal of this state may permit a party or witness        residing in another state to be deposed or to testify by telephone, audiovisual means, or other        electronic means at a designated tribunal or other location in that state.  A tribunal of this state shall        cooperate with tribunals of other states in designating an appropriate location for the deposition or        testimony.                 If a party called to testify at a civil hearing refuses to answer on the ground that the        testimony may be self incriminating, the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference from the refusal.                 A privilege against disclosure of communications between spouses does not apply in a        proceeding under this chapter.                 The defense of immunity based on the relationship of husband and wife or parent and        child does not apply in a proceeding under this chapter.            Section    .

A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a child        support order issued in another state shall register that order in this state in the same manner        provided in Sections       a    ,      a    ,      a           f    ,      f    ,      f    ,        and       a           f     if the order has not been registered.  A petition for modification may        be filed at the same time as a request for registration, or later.  The pleading must specify the grounds        for modification.            Section    .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read                    a     .           f    .  Effect of registration for modification.                      A tribunal of this state may enforce a child support order of another state registered for        purposes of modification, in the same manner as if the order had been issued by a tribunal of this        state, but the registered order may be modified only if the requirements of Section       a                  f     have been met.            Section    .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read                    a     .           f    .  Modification of child support order of another state.                 After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this state, the        responding tribunal of this state may modify that order only if ,  Section      f     does not apply        and after notice and hearing ,  it finds that              a   the following requirements are met              i   the child, the individual obligee, and the obligor    A    do not reside in the issuing state          and               B   either reside in this state or are subject to the jurisdiction of this state pursuant to        Section      a      and               ii   in any case where another state is exercising or seeks to exercise jurisdiction to modify        the order, the conditions of Section      a     are met to the same extent as required for        proceedings to establish orders  or              ii   a petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification  and             iii   the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state  or             b    an individual party or  the child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the        personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state and all of the  individual  parties who are individuals        have filed  a  written  consent  consents in the issuing tribunal  providing that  for a tribunal of this        state  may  to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.         However, if the issuing state is a foreign jurisdiction that has not enacted a law or established        procedures substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter, the consent otherwise required        of an individual residing in this state is not required for the tribunal to assume jurisdiction to modify        the child support order.                           Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements,        procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state        and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.                 A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not        be modified under the law of the issuing state.  If two or more tribunals have issued child support        orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under        Section      f     establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.                 On issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal        of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.                  Within    days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the        modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal which had continuing,        exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows that earlier        order has been registered.             Section    .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read                    a     .           f    .  Recognition of order modified in another state.            A tribunal of this state shall recognize a modification of its earlier child support order by a        tribunal of another state which assumed jurisdiction pursuant to a law substantially similar to this        chapter and, upon request, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall                  enforce the order that was modified only as to amounts accruing before the modification                  enforce only nonmodifiable aspects of that order                  provide other appropriate relief only for violations of that order which occurred before        the effective date of the modification  and                 recognize the modifying order of the other state, upon registration, for the purpose of        enforcement.            Section    .  Section       f     is enacted to read                   f    .  Jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state when individual         parties reside in this state.                           If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside        in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state s        child support order in a proceeding to register that order.                 A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the        provisions of Parts   and  , this part, and the procedural and substantive law of this state to the        proceeding for enforcement of modification.  Parts  ,  ,  ,  , and   do not apply.            Section    .  Section       f     is enacted to read                   f    .  Notice to issuing tribunal of modification.            Within    days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the        modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing,        exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier        order has been registered.  A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject        to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure to file        does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having        continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.            Section    .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read          Part  .  Determination of Parentage                    a     .           f    .  Proceeding to determine parentage.                 A tribunal of this state may serve as an initiating or responding tribunal in a proceeding        brought under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter or  Title   , Chapter   ,          the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, to determine that the petitioner is a parent of        a particular child or to determine that a respondent is a parent of that child.                 In a proceeding to determine parentage, a responding tribunal of this state shall apply        Title   , Chapter   a, Uniform Act on Paternity, and the rules of this state on choice of law.            Section    .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read          Part  .

For purposes of this part,  governor  includes an individual performing the functions of        governor or the executive authority of a state covered by this chapter.                 The governor of this state may              a   demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual found in the other state        who is charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee         or             b   on the demand by the governor of another state, surrender an individual found in this        state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of an        obligee.                 A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this chapter applies to        the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state when        the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled therefrom.            Section    .  Section       f    , which is renumbered from Section      a     is        renumbered and amended to read                    a     .           f    .  Conditions of rendition.                 Before making demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged        criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of        this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least    days previously the        obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would        be of no avail.                 If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter or  Title   , Chapter          ,  the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, the governor of another state makes a        demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with        having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is        owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a        proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective.  If it appears that a proceeding would        be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable                  time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.                 If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is        demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.  If the petitioner prevails and the        individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to        honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
