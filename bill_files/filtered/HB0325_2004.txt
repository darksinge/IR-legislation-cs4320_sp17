Highlighted Provisions                                This bill                                .    provides that an insurer issuing a motor vehicle insurance policy that covers an                           at fault driver may not reduce compensation to an injured party based on the injured                           party not being covered by a policy of insurance that provides personal injury                           protection coverage.

Section      A            is amended to read                                   A       .  Motor vehicle liability coverage.                                    a   In addition to complying with the requirements of Chapter   , Insurance                             Contracts in General, and  Part II of  Chapter   , Part  , Liability Insurance in General, a                           policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection       A               a  shall                                 i   name the motor vehicle owner or operator in whose name the policy was purchased,                           state that named insured s address, the coverage afforded, the premium charged, the policy                           period, and the limits of liability                                 ii   A   if it is an owner s policy, designate by appropriate reference all the motor                           vehicles on which coverage is granted, insure the person named in the policy, insure any other                           person using any named motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named                           insured, and, except as provided in Subsection    , insure any person included in Subsection                               a  iii  against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the                           ownership, maintenance, or use of these motor vehicles within the United States and Canada,                           subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, for each motor vehicle, in amounts not less                           than the minimum limits specified under Section       A             or                                B   if it is an operator s policy, insure the person named as insured against loss from                           the liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the insured s use of any motor                           vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and with the same limits of liability                           as in an owner s policy under Subsection     ii  A                                  iii   except as provided in Subsection    , insure persons related to the named insured                           by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship who are residents of the named insured s                           household, including those who usually make their home in the same household but                           temporarily live elsewhere, to the same extent as the named insured and the available coverage                           of the policy may not be reduced to the persons described in this Subsection     a  iii  because                                 A   a permissive user driving a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident                            or                                B   the named insured or any of the persons described in this Subsection     a  iii                            driving a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident  and                                iv   cover damages or injury resulting from a covered driver of a motor vehicle who is                           stricken by an unforeseeable paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition and who is not                           reasonably aware that paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition is about to occur to the                           extent that a person of ordinary prudence would not attempt to continue driving.                                b   The driver s liability under Subsection     a  iv  is limited to the insurance                              coverage.                                    a   A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection                              A               a  may                                 i   provide for the prorating of the insurance under that policy with other valid and                           collectible insurance                                 ii   grant any lawful coverage in addition to the required motor vehicle liability                           coverage                                 iii   if the policy is issued to a person other than a motor vehicle business, limit the                           coverage afforded to a motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the                           minimum limits under Section       A           , and to those instances when there is no other valid                           and collectible insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary,                           excess, or contingent  and                                iv   if issued to a motor vehicle business, restrict coverage afforded to anyone other                           than the motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits                           under Section       A           , and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible                           insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or                           contingent.                                b   i   The liability insurance coverage of a permissive user of a motor vehicle owned                           by a motor vehicle business shall be primary coverage.                                ii   The liability insurance coverage of a motor vehicle business shall be secondary to                           the liability insurance coverage of a permissive user as specified under Subsection     b  i .                                    Motor vehicle liability coverage need not insure any liability                                 a   under any workers  compensation law under Title   A, Utah Labor Code                                 b   resulting from bodily injury to or death of an employee of the named insured, other                           than a domestic employee, while engaged in the employment of the insured, or while engaged                           in the operation, maintenance, or repair of a designated vehicle  or                                c   resulting from damage to property owned by, rented to, bailed to, or transported by                           the insured.                                    An insurance carrier providing motor vehicle liability coverage has the right to                           settle any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount                           of the settlement is deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section       A           .                                       A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage imposes on the insurer the                           duty to defend, in good faith, any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit                           seeking damages which would be payable under the policy.                                    a   If a policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage provides an insurer with                           the defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured, that defense is not effective                           against a third person making a claim against the insurer, unless there was collusion between                           the third person and the insured.                                b   If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant, after                           payment, the insurer is subrogated to the injured person s claim against the insured to the extent                           of the payment and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has                            been made whole with respect to the claim against the insured.                                     A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection       A               may                            specifically exclude from coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured s                            household, including a person who usually makes his home in the same household but                            temporarily lives elsewhere, if                                  a   at the time of the proposed exclusion, each person excluded from coverage satisfies                            the owner s or operator s security requirement of Section          a        , independently of the                            named insured s proof of owner s or operator s security                                  b   the named insured and the person excluded from coverage each provide written                            consent to the exclusion  and                                 c   the insurer includes the name of each person excluded from coverage in the                            evidence of insurance provided to an additional insured or loss payee.                                     A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage may limit coverage to the policy                            minimum limits under Section       A            if the insured motor vehicle is operated by a person                            who has consumed any alcohol or any illegal drug or illegal substance if the policy or a                            specifically reduced premium was extended to the insured upon express written declaration                            executed by the insured that the insured motor vehicle would not be so operated.                                     a   When a claim is brought exclusively by a named insured or a person described                            in Subsection     a  iii  and asserted exclusively against a named insured or an individual                            described in Subsection     a  iii , the claimant may elect to resolve the claim                                  i   by submitting the claim to binding arbitration  or                                    ii   through litigation.                                 b   Once the claimant has elected to commence litigation under Subsection     a  ii ,                            the claimant may not elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration under this section                            without the written consent of both parties and the defendant s liability insurer.                                 c   i   Unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties, a claim that is submitted to                            binding arbitration under Subsection     a  i  shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators.                                 ii   Unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties, each party shall select an                            arbitrator.  The arbitrators selected by the parties shall select a third arbitrator.                                 d   Unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties, each party will pay the fees                            and costs of the arbitrator that party selects.  Both parties shall share equally the fees and costs                            of the third arbitrator.                                 e   Except as otherwise provided in this section, an arbitration procedure conducted                            under this section shall be governed by Title    Chapter   a, Utah Uniform Arbitration Act,                            unless otherwise agreed on in writing by the parties.                                 f   i   Discovery shall be conducted in accordance with Rules   b through   , Utah                            Rules of Civil Procedure.                                 ii   All issues of discovery shall be resolved by the arbitration panel.                                 g   A written decision of two of the three arbitrators shall constitute a final decision of                            the arbitration panel.                                 h   Prior to the rendering of the arbitration award                                  i   the existence of a liability insurance policy may be disclosed to the arbitration                            panel  and                                 ii   the amount of all applicable liability insurance policy limits may not be disclosed to                            the arbitration panel.                                 i   The amount of the arbitration award may not exceed the liability limits of all the                            defendant s applicable liability insurance policies, including applicable liability umbrella                            policies.  If the initial arbitration award exceeds the liability limits of all applicable liability                            insurance policies, the arbitration award shall be reduced to an amount equal to the liability                            limits of all applicable liability insurance policies.                                 j   The arbitration award is the final resolution of all claims between the parties unless                            the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means.                                    k   If the arbitration panel finds that the action was not brought, pursued, or defended                            in good faith, the arbitration panel may award reasonable fees and costs against the party that                            failed to bring, pursue, or defend the claim in good faith.                                 l   Nothing in this section is intended to limit any claim under any other portion of an                            applicable insurance policy.                                      An insurer issuing a policy of insurance under this part that is covering an at fault                           driver may not reduce compensation to an injured party based on the injured party not being                           covered by a policy of insurance that provides personal injury protection coverage under                           Sections       A            through       A           .
