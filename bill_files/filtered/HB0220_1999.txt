It is the intent of the Legislature that in accordance with this act the Utah Technology                           Finance Corporation and its supporting foundation be dissolved as soon as practical but by no later                           than January  ,     , if no event unforseen by the Legislature occurs that the Department of                           Community and Economic Development determines                                  a    prevents dissolution  or                                 b   makes dissolution not in the best interest of the state.                                        a   Because at the time of passage of this act the Utah Technology Finance Corporation                           administers numerous loans either issued by the corporation or by some other entity, the ongoing                           administration of these loans must be addressed as part of any dissolution.  Therefore, it is the                           intent of the Legislature as provided in this act that either                                  i   these loans be administered by the Department of Community and Economic                           Development  or                                 ii   these loans be sold to a private entity.                                 b   It is not the intent of the Legislature that this act create any new authority in the                           Department of Community and Economic Development to issue loans or give economic                           development grants.                                     At the time of passage of this act the Utah Technology Finance Corporation has entered                           into various contracts, including contracts for the administration of loans issued in whole or in part                           by entities other than the corporation.  It is not the intent of the Legislature that this act either                           creates any new authority or eliminates any existing authority within the Department of                           Community and Economic Development to enter into contracts or arrangements including                           contracts related to financing activities or economic development in this state.        Legislative Review Note      as of                PM     This legislation raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns    This legislation requires the dissolution of Utah Technology Finance Corporation   UTFC   and  its supporting foundation and the transfer of many of their assets to the state.  Because these  corporations have characteristics of private entities, the required dissolution and the transfer of  assets raise constitutional questions such as   whether the legislation constitutes a takings  whether  the legislation is improper special legislation  whether the legislation impairs contracts  or whether  the legislation violates equal protection or due process.    The forced dissolution of a quasi governmental entity is rare, and therefore there is little direct  precedent to indicate how a court may rule on any constitutional questions raised.   However, the  legislation is consistent with the Legislature s power to create and set the operating parameters of  quasi governmental entities and with the fact that a primary source of funding of UTFC has been  state appropriations.  In addition, the process established by the legislation is designed to ensure  that the contractual obligations of UTFC and its supporting foundation are not impaired.
