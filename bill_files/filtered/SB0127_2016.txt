Reasonable medical benefits in excess of the first    ,    shall be paid in the first       instance by the employer or its insurance carrier.  Then, as provided in Subsection    , the       Employers  Reinsurance Fund shall reimburse the employer or its insurance carrier for     of       those expenses.                 After the initial     week period under Subsection    , permanent total disability       compensation payable to an employee under this chapter or Chapter  , Utah Occupational       Disease Act, becomes the liability of and shall be paid by the Employers  Reinsurance Fund.                 If it is determined that the employee is permanently and totally disabled, the       employer or its insurance carrier shall be given credit for all prior payments of temporary total,       temporary partial, and permanent partial disability compensation made as a result of the       industrial accident.   Any  An overpayment by the employer or its insurance carrier shall be       reimbursed by the Employers  Reinsurance Fund under Subsection    .                 a   i   Upon receipt of a duly verified petition, the Employers  Reinsurance Fund       shall reimburse the employer or its insurance carrier for the Employers  Reinsurance Fund s       share of medical benefits and compensation paid to or on behalf of an employee.             ii   A request for Employers  Reinsurance Fund reimbursements shall be accompanied       by satisfactory evidence of payment of the medical or disability compensation for which the       reimbursement is requested.   Each              iii   A request is subject to review as to reasonableness by the administrator.  The       administrator may determine the manner of reimbursement.             b   A decision of the administrator under Subsection     a  may be appealed in       accordance with Part  , Adjudication.             c   An employer or its insurance carrier shall submit to the Employers  Reinsurance       Fund, by June   ,     , a request for reimbursement related to medical benefits or       compensation paid on or before July  ,     .             d   An employer or its insurance carrier shall submit to the Employers  Reinsurance       Fund a request for reimbursement related to medical benefits or compensation paid after July  ,           , within    months of the later of              i   the date the benefits or compensation are paid by the employer or its insurance       carrier  or             ii   the date the Employers  Reinsurance Fund is determined to be liable.             e   Requests for reimbursement not submitted in accordance with Subsection     c  or           d  are considered untimely and the Employers  Reinsurance Fund may not reimburse the       benefits or compensation paid.
