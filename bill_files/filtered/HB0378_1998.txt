Hendrickson          AN ACT RELATING TO THE CRIMINAL CODE  AMENDING DEFINITIONS REGARDING         VICTIM RESTITUTION BY CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF  VICTIM  AND         DELETING THE UNUSED DEFINITION OF  FAMILY MEMBER .         This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows          AMENDS                        , as last amended by Chapters   ,   , and    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section           is amended to read                        .  Sentences or combination of sentences allowed    Civil penalties              Restitution    Hearing    Definitions.                   As used in this section                a    Conviction  includes a                i   judgment of guilt  and               ii   plea of guilty.               b    Criminal activities  means any offense of which the defendant is convicted or any          other criminal conduct for which the defendant admits responsibility to the sentencing court with          or without an admission of committing the criminal conduct.               c    Pecuniary damages  means all special damages, but not general damages, which a          person could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events          constituting the defendant s criminal activities and includes the money equivalent of property          taken, destroyed, broken, or otherwise harmed, and losses including earnings and medical          expenses.               d    Restitution  means full, partial, or nominal payment for pecuniary damages to a           victim, including the accrual of interest from the time of sentencing, insured damages, and         payment for expenses to a governmental entity for extradition or transportation and as further         defined in Subsection     c .              e   i    Victim  means any person whom the court determines has suffered pecuniary         damages as a result of the defendant s criminal activities.              ii    Victim  does not include any coparticipant in the defendant s criminal activities.                  Within the limits prescribed by this chapter, a court may sentence a person convicted         of an offense to any one of the following sentences or combination of them               a   to pay a fine                b   to removal or disqualification from public or private office                c   to probation unless otherwise specifically provided by law                d   to imprisonment                e   to life imprisonment                f   on or after April   ,     , to life in prison without parole  or               g   to death.                   a   This chapter does not deprive a court of authority conferred by law to                i   forfeit property                ii   dissolve a corporation                iii   suspend or cancel a license                iv   permit removal of a person from office                v   cite for contempt  or               vi   impose any other civil penalty.               b   A civil penalty may be included in a sentence.                   a   i   When a person is convicted of criminal activity that has resulted in pecuniary          damages, in addition to any other sentence it may impose, the court shall order that the defendant          make restitution to victims of crime as provided in this subsection, or for conduct for which the          defendant has agreed to make restitution as part of a plea agreement.   For purposes of restitution,          a victim has the meaning as defined in  Section         and family member has the meaning as          defined in Section          Subsection     e .               ii   In determining whether restitution is appropriate, the court shall follow the criteria and          procedures as provided in Subsections     c  and     d .                      iii   If the court finds the defendant owes restitution, the clerk of the court shall enter an         order of complete restitution as defined in Subsection     b  on the civil judgment docket and         provide notice of the order to the parties.              iv   The order is considered a legal judgment enforceable under the Utah Rules of Civil         Procedure, and the person in whose favor the restitution order is entered may seek enforcement         of the restitution order in accordance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.  In addition, the         Department of Corrections may, on behalf of the person in whose favor the restitution order is         entered, enforce the restitution order as judgment creditor under the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.              v   If the defendant fails to obey a court order for payment of restitution and the victim or          department elects to pursue collection of the order by civil process, the victim shall be entitled to          recover reasonable attorney s fees.               vi   A judgment ordering restitution constitutes a lien when recorded in a judgment docket          and shall have the same effect and is subject to the same rules as a judgment for money in a civil          action.  Interest shall accrue on the amount ordered from the time of sentencing.               vii   The Department of Corrections shall make rules permitting the restitution payments          to be credited to principal first and the remainder of payments credited to interest in accordance          with Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.               b   i   If a defendant has been extradited to this state under Title   , Chapter   ,          Extradition, to resolve pending criminal charges and is convicted of criminal activity in the county          to which he has been returned, the court may, in addition to any other sentence it may impose,          order that the defendant make restitution for costs expended by any governmental entity for the          extradition.               ii   In determining whether restitution is appropriate, the court shall consider the criteria          in Subsection     c .               c   In determining restitution, the court shall determine complete restitution and          court ordered restitution.               i   Complete restitution means the restitution necessary to compensate a victim for all          losses caused by the defendant.               ii   Court ordered restitution means the restitution the court having criminal jurisdiction          orders the defendant to pay as a part of the criminal sentence at the time of sentencing.               iii   Complete restitution and court ordered restitution shall be determined as provided in                 Subsection    .              d   i   If the court determines that restitution is appropriate or inappropriate under this         subsection, the court shall make the reasons for the decision a part of the court record.              ii   In any civil action brought by a victim to enforce the judgment, the defendant shall be         entitled to offset any amounts that have been paid as part of court ordered restitution to the victim.              iii   A judgment ordering restitution constitutes a lien when recorded in a judgment docket         and shall have the same effect and is subject to the same rules as a judgment for money in a civil         action.  Interest shall accrue on the amount ordered from the time of sentencing.              iv   The Department of Corrections shall make rules permitting the restitution payments          to be credited to principal first and the remainder of payments credited to interest in accordance          with Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.               e   If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount, or distribution of the restitution, the          court shall at the time of sentencing allow the defendant a full hearing on the issue.                   a   In addition to any other sentence the court may impose, the court shall order the          defendant to pay restitution of governmental transportation expenses if the defendant was                i   transported pursuant to court order from one county to another within the state at          governmental expense to resolve pending criminal charges                ii   charged with a felony or a class A, B, or C misdemeanor  and               iii   convicted of a crime.               b   The court may not order the defendant to pay restitution of governmental transportation          expenses if any of the following apply                i   the defendant is charged with an infraction or on a subsequent failure to appear a          warrant is issued for an infraction  or               ii   the defendant was not transported pursuant to a court order.               c   i   Restitution of governmental transportation expenses under Subsection     a  i  shall          be calculated according to the following schedule                A       for up to     miles a defendant is transported                B        for     up to     miles a defendant is transported  and               C        for     miles or more a defendant is transported.               ii   The schedule of restitution under Subsection     c  i  applies to each defendant          transported regardless of the number of defendants actually transported in a single trip.                          a   If a statute under which the defendant was convicted mandates that one of three         stated minimum terms shall be imposed, the court shall order imposition of the term of middle         severity unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.              b   Prior to or at the time of sentencing, either party may submit a statement identifying         circumstances in aggravation or mitigation or presenting additional facts.  If the statement is in         writing, it shall be filed with the court and served on the opposing party at least four days prior to         the time set for sentencing.              c   In determining whether there are circumstances that justify imposition of the highest         or lowest term, the court may consider the record in the case, the probation officer s report, other          reports, including reports received under Section         , statements in aggravation or mitigation          submitted by the prosecution or the defendant, and any further evidence introduced at the          sentencing hearing.               d   The court shall set forth on the record the facts supporting and reasons for imposing          the upper or lower term.               e   The court in determining a just sentence shall consider sentencing guidelines regarding          aggravation and mitigation promulgated by the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice.                   If during the commission of a crime described as child kidnaping, rape of a child,          object rape of a child, sodomy upon a child, or sexual abuse of a child, the defendant causes          substantial bodily injury to the child, and if the charge is set forth in the information or indictment          and admitted by the defendant, or found true by a judge or jury at trial, the defendant shall be          sentenced to the highest minimum term in state prison.  This subsection takes precedence over any          conflicting provision of law.                   a   For the purpose of determining restitution for an offense, the offense shall include          any criminal conduct admitted by the defendant to the sentencing court or to which the defendant          agrees to pay restitution.  A victim of an offense, that involves as an element a scheme, a          conspiracy, or a pattern of criminal activity, includes any person directly harmed by the defendant s          criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.               b   In determining the monetary sum and other conditions for complete restitution, the          court shall consider all relevant facts, including                i   the cost of the damage or loss if the offense resulted in damage to or loss or destruction          of property of a victim of the offense                       ii   the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to         physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered         in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment  the cost         of necessary physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation  and the income lost by the         victim as a result of the offense if the offense resulted in bodily injury to a victim  and              iii   the cost of necessary funeral and related services if the offense resulted in the death         of a victim.              c   In determining the monetary sum and other conditions for court ordered restitution, the         court shall consider the factors listed in Subsection     b  and                i   the financial resources of the defendant and the burden that payment of restitution will          impose, with regard to the other obligations of the defendant                ii   the ability of the defendant to pay restitution on an installment basis or on other          conditions to be fixed by the court                iii   the rehabilitative effect on the defendant of the payment of restitution and the method          of payment  and               iv   other circumstances which the court determines make restitution inappropriate.               d   The court may decline to make an order or may defer entering an order of restitution          if the court determines that the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process, as a result          of considering an order of restitution under this subsection, substantially outweighs the need to          provide restitution to the victim.
