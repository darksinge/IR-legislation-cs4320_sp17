to protect the  minor  child, after having received the notice, by allowing the  minor                            child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes

If a parent has received actual notice that                           physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence                           that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that                           fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or                           sexually abused                                   d   the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child                                  e   the  minor  child has been left without any provision for  his  the child s support                                  f   a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for                            safe and appropriate care for the  minor  child                                  g   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the  minor  child has been left by the                            parent is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the  minor  child, the whereabouts                            of the parent are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate  him have been  the parent are                            unsuccessful                                  h   the  minor  child is in immediate need of medical care                                     i   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to                            the child s health or safety                                  j   the  minor  child or another  minor  child residing in the same household has been                            neglected                                  k   the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been                            charged or arrested pursuant to Title   , Chapter   d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any                            clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section          d      , was located in the residence                            or on the property where the child resided  or                                 l   the child s welfare is otherwise endangered.                                      a   For purposes of Subsection     a , if a child has previously been adjudicated as                           abused, neglected, or dependent and a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency                           occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the                           custody of the child s parent.                                 b   For purposes of Subsection     c , if a parent has received actual notice that                           physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred, and there is evidence                           that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser, that                           fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or                           sexually abused.                                             a   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether                            reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the  minor  child                            from  his  the child s home and whether there are available services that would prevent the                            need for continued removal.  If the court finds that the  minor  child can be safely returned to                            the custody of  his  the child s parent or guardian through the provision of those services, it                            shall place the  minor  child with  his  the child s parent or guardian and order that those                            services be provided by the division.                                 b   In making  that  the determination described in Subsection      a , and in ordering                            and providing services, the child s health,  safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern,                            in accordance with federal law.                                                Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an                            emergency situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a                            finding that any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                                             In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical                            abuse or neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make                             reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in  his  the child s                            home, return a child to  his  the child s home, provide reunification services, or attempt to                            rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                                             The court may not order continued removal of a  minor  child solely on the                            basis of educational neglect as described in Subsection         a            s  ii .                                             a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a  minor  child under this                            section, it shall state the facts on which that decision is based.                                 b   If no continued removal is ordered and the  minor  child is returned home, the court                            shall state the facts on which that decision is based.                                             If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are                            necessary for the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if  he  the child                            were returned home, it shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial                            removal of the child, or the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other                            procedural requirement of this chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.

Upon the filing of a petition, the clerk of the court shall set the pretrial hearing on                            the petition within    calendar days from the later of                                  a   the date of the shelter hearing  or                                 b   the filing of the petition , whichever is later .                                     The pretrial may be continued upon motion of any party, for good cause shown, but                            the final adjudication hearing shall be held no later than    calendar days from the later of                                  a   the date of the shelter hearing  or                                    b   the filing of the petition , whichever is later .                                      In the case where a petition has been filed but the child is not in protective custody                           or temporary custody, the court shall give scheduling priority to the pretrial and adjudication                           hearings on the petition if the division indicates in the petition that without expedited hearings                           and services ordered under the protective supervision of the court the child will likely be taken                           into protective custody.
