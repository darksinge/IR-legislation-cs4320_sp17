          b   A surplus line producer may place insurance under this section with an insurer        described in Subsection     a  if the surplus line producer               i   gives the applicant

does not hold a certificate of authority to        do business in this state and thus is not fully subject to regulation by the Utah insurance        commissioner.  This policy receives no protection from any of the guaranty associations created        under Title   A, Chapter   , Guaranty Associations.

If the commissioner finds it necessary to protect the interests of insureds and the        public in this state, the commissioner may by rule subject a policy issued under this section to        as much of the regulation provided by this title as is required for a comparable policy written        by an authorized foreign insurer.                   a   A surplus lines transaction in this state shall be examined to determine whether        it complies with               i   the surplus lines tax levied under Chapter  , Department Funding, Fees, and Taxes               ii   the solicitation limitations of Subsection                   iii   the requirement of Subsection     that placement be through a surplus lines        producer               iv   placement limitations imposed under Subsections     a ,  b , and  c   and              v   the policy form requirements of Subsections     and     .              b   The examination described in Subsection      a  shall take place as soon as        practicable after the transaction.  The surplus lines producer shall submit to the examiner        information necessary to conduct the examination within a period specified by rule.              c   i   The examination described in Subsection      a  may be conducted by the        commissioner or by an advisory organization created under Section   A        and authorized        by the commissioner to conduct these examinations.

B   A stamping fee collected by the commissioner shall be deposited in the General        Fund.              C   The commissioner shall establish a stamping fee by rule.              ii   A stamping fee collected by an advisory organization is the property of the advisory        organization to be used in paying the expenses of the advisory organization.              iii   Liability for paying a stamping fee is as required under Subsection   A                 for taxes imposed under Section   A      .              iv   The commissioner shall adopt a rule dealing with the payment of stamping fees.  If        a stamping fee is not paid when due, the commissioner or advisory organization may impose a        penalty of     of the stamping fee due, plus        per month from the time of default until        full payment of the stamping fee.              v   A stamping fee relative to a policy covering a risk located partially in this state        shall be allocated in the same manner as under Subsection   A         .              e   The commissioner, representatives of the department, advisory organizations,        representatives and members of advisory organizations, authorized insurers, and surplus lines        insurers are not liable for damages on account of statements, comments, or recommendations        made in good faith in connection with their duties under this Subsection      e  or under        Section   A       .              f   An examination conducted under this Subsection      and a document or materials        related to the examination are confidential.                   a   For a surplus lines insurance transaction in the state entered into on or after        May   ,     , if an audit is required by the surplus lines insurance policy, a surplus lines        insurer               i   shall exercise due diligence to initiate an audit of an insured, to determine whether        additional premium is owed by the insured, by no later than six months after the expiration of        the term for which premium is paid  and              ii   may not audit an insured more than three years after the surplus lines insurance        policy expires.              b   A surplus lines insurer that does not comply with this Subsection      may not        charge or collect additional premium in excess of the premium agreed to under the surplus        lines insurance policy.
