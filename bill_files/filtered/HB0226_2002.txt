The act amends the grounds for termination of parental                          rights.  Under the act, if a juvenile court orders that reunification services be provided, the                          court may later terminate all parental rights of a parent under certain grounds only if the                          parent has been unwilling or unable, within a reasonable period of time, to correct the                           circumstances, conduct, or conditions that led to placement of the parent s child outside of                           their home notwithstanding reasonable and appropriate efforts required of the Division of                           Child and Family Services.  The act makes technical changes.
