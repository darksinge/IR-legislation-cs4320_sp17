Roberts                                Senate Sponsor             David P. Hinkins                                                         LONG TITLE                          General Description                                This joint resolution of the Legislature declares and asserts the jurisdictional right of the                           state of Utah and its political subdivisions to respond to and take action when                           conditions on federally managed land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely                           affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people.                           Highlighted Provisions                                This resolution                                .    declares and asserts the jurisdictional right of the state of Utah and its political                           subdivisions to respond to and take action when conditions on federally managed                           land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely affect, the health, safety, or                           welfare of the people without the intrusion and interference of the federal                           government on its efforts to respond to the needs of its citizens  and                               .    urges other states to declare and assert their rights, and the rights of their political                           subdivisions, to respond to and take action when conditions on federally managed                           land in the state adversely affect, or may adversely affect, the health, safety, or                           welfare of the people without the intrusion and interference of the federal                           government on the states  efforts to respond to the needs of their citizens.                           Special Clauses                                None                                                       Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                WHEREAS, in its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act decision, released June                               , the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed the position of the states as  separate and                           independent sovereigns                                 WHEREAS, the court made it clear that the federal government  must show that a                           constitutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions                                 WHEREAS, in contrast, the Supreme Court further explained that  the same does not                           apply to the States, because the Constitution is not the source of their power .  .  . The States                           thus can and do perform many of the vital functions of modern government .  .  . even though                           the Constitution s text does not authorize any government to do so                                 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court added,  Our cases refer to this general power of                           governing, possessed by the States but not by the federal government, as the  police power.   . . .                           Because the police power is controlled by    different states instead of one national sovereign,                           the facets of governing that touch on citizens  daily lives are normally administered by smaller                           governments closer to the governed.  The Framers thus ensured that powers which  in the                           ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people  were held                           by governments more local and more accountable than a distant bureaucracy                                 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court also highlighted a vital role of states  authority in                           relation to the federal government, stating,  The independent power of the States also serves as                           a check on the power of the Federal Government   By denying any one government complete                           jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual                           from arbitrary power . . . In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives                           by adopting  the simple expedient of not yielding  to federal blandishments when they do not                           want to embrace the federal policies as their own                                 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court, concluding this line of logic, declared,  The States are                           separate and independent sovereigns.  Sometimes they have to act like it                                 WHEREAS, in     , the Court, in Utah Power and Light v. United States, held that                            The power of the United States to protect its property by its own legislation from private                           trespass and waste does not, and cannot, imply a general police power over the vacant public                           lands within a State.  The section in the Constitution relating to the admission of new States,                              and the concomitant disposition of the public lands, excludes, by its express terms, any                           construction by which the United States may claim any additional governmental or police                           powers within the States in which such public land is situated                                 WHEREAS, Article  , Section  , Clause   , of the United States Constitution states                           that the federal government will  exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over                           such District  not exceeding ten Miles square  as may, by Cession of Particular States, and the                           Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to                           exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State                           in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock Yards, and                           other needful Buildings                                 WHEREAS, the domain of exclusive jurisdiction by the federal government is limited                           to the District of Columbia and other Places purchased by the Consent of the State Legislatures                           for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock Yards, and other needful Buildings                           incidental to the powers expressly granted within the Constitution                                WHEREAS,  other needful Buildings  did not include vast acres of undeveloped land                                WHEREAS, although Section   of the Utah Enabling Act states, in part,  That the                           people inhabiting said proposed State do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right                           and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof,  the state of                           Utah did not disclaim its jurisdiction                                WHEREAS, during the Eisenhower Administration, the United States government                           published a report entitled  Report of the Interdepartmental Committee for the Study of                           Jurisdiction Over Federal Areas Within the States  in which four basic areas of federal                           jurisdiction were identified                                 .  Exclusive Legislative Jurisdiction  This term is applied when the federal government                           possesses, by whichever method acquired, all of the authority of the State, and in which the                           State concerned has not reserved to itself the right to exercise any of the authority concurrently                           with the United States except to serve civil or criminal process in the area for activities that                           occurred outside the area                                 .  Concurrent Legislative Jurisdiction  This term is applied in those instances wherein                           by granting to the United States authority    which would otherwise amount to exclusive                           legislative jurisdiction over an area    the State concerned has reserved to itself the right to                              exercise, concurrently with the United States, all of the same authority                                 .  Partial Legislative Jurisdiction  This term is applied in those instances wherein a                           state has granted authority to the federal government to legislate over an area of the state but                            the state has reserved to itself the right to exercise, by itself or concurrently with the United                           States, other authority constituting more than merely the right to serve civil or criminal process                           in the area, or the right to tax private property                                 .  Proprietorial Interest Only  This term is applied to those instances wherein the                           federal government has acquired some right or title to an area in a state, but has not obtained                           any measure of the State s authority over the area.  In applying this definition, recognition                           should be given to the fact that the United States, by virtue of its functions and authority under                            various provisions of the Constitution, has many powers and immunities not possessed by                            ordinary landholders with respect to areas in which it acquires an interest, and of the further                            fact that all its properties and functions are held or performed in a governmental, rather than a                            proprietary, capacity                                 WHEREAS, the report also stated,  It scarcely needs to be said that unless there has                            been a transfer of jurisdiction pursuant to clause    by a Federal acquisition of land with State                            consent, or by cession from the State to the Federal Government, or unless the Federal                            Government has reserved jurisdiction upon admission of the State, the Federal Government                            possesses no legislative jurisdiction over any area within a State, such jurisdiction being for                            exercise by the State, subject to non interference by the State with Federal functions. . .  The                            consent requirement of Article I, Section  , Clause   , was intended by the framers of the                            Constitution to preserve the State s jurisdictional integrity against federal encroachment.  The                            Federal Government cannot, by unilateral action on its part, acquire legislative jurisdiction over                            any area within the exterior boundaries of a State                                  WHEREAS, an Inventory Report On Jurisdictional Status of Federal Areas Within the                            States, compiled by the United States General Services Administration, categorizes all United                            States Forest Service  USFS  and Bureau of Land Management  BLM  land in the state of Utah                            as   , Proprietorial Interest Only                                 WHEREAS, the USFS and the BLM have caused a public nuisance and safety issue for                            the people of the state of Utah and Utah s political subdivisions by not removing the condition,                            persistently in the National Forest and BLM system lands, of imminent fire and not mitigating                               the effects of recent fires                                 WHEREAS, Utah s      Shingle Creek Fire was human caused on USFS land                                 WHEREAS, the fire was one third contained by the operation of one bulldozer                                 WHEREAS, four bulldozers were ready for use by   p.m. on the day of the fire, but                            since the fire was on USFS land, only one bulldozer was allowed to operate until    p.m. and                            was only allowed to operate one blade wide and to dig no deeper than two inches                                 WHEREAS, as a result, the fire burned more than  ,    acres, damaged and altered the                            local watershed, created future risks of debris and mudslides, and will require costly repairs                                 WHEREAS, Utah s      Seeley Fire, which was started by lightning, eventually                            destroyed over   ,    acres, or    square miles                                 WHEREAS, debris flow and sediment from the Seeley Fire will be a major issue in the                            surrounding watershed for the next two to five years, impacting local municipalities, power                            plants, local businesses, homes, roads, bridges, and farms                                 WHEREAS, in one instance, the USFS chose to bulldoze a portion of private land,                            claiming it was the best place to fight the wildfire                                 WHEREAS, these are just two examples of conditions at the community level that have                            been made worse by the federal government s mismanagement of federal lands                                 WHEREAS, the jurisdictional right of states and their political subdivisions to mitigate                            potential risks to the health, safety, or welfare of the state or a political subdivision should not                            be fettered by the federal bureaucracy  and                                WHEREAS, states should assert their rights to mitigate potential risks to the health,                            safety, or welfare of the state or a political subdivision and not allow their authority to be                            eroded by federal government claims of authority                                 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah                            declare and assert its jurisdictional right, and the right of its political subdivisions, to respond                            to and take action when conditions on federally managed land in the state adversely affect, or                            may adversely affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people without the intrusion and                            interference of the federal government on its efforts to respond to the needs of their citizens.                                BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature urges the states to declare and                            assert their jurisdictional rights, and the rights of their political subdivisions, to respond to and                            take action when conditions on federally managed land in the states adversely affect, or may                               adversely affect, the health, safety, or welfare of the people without the intrusion and                            interference of the federal government on efforts to respond to the needs of their citizens.                                BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the president of                            the United States, the majority leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United                            States House of Representatives, the United States Forest Service, the commissions of each                            county in the state of Utah, the Council of State Governments, the National Conference of State                            Legislatures, and the members of Utah s congressional delegation.
