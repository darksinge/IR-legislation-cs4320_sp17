Section         b         is amended to read                                      b    .  Restrictive drug formulary prohibited.                                       As used in this section                                 a    Generic form  means a prescription drug that is available in generic form and has                           an A rating in the United States Pharmacopeia and Drug Index.                                b    Legend drug  means any drug that requires a prescription under state or federal                           law.                                c    Restrictive drug formulary  means a list of legend drugs, other than drugs for                           cosmetic purposes, that are prohibited by the Department of Health from dispensation, but are                           approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration.                                    A practitioner may prescribe legend drugs in accordance with this chapter that, in                           his professional judgment and within the lawful scope of his practice, he considers appropriate                           for the diagnosis and treatment of his patient.                                    Except as provided in Subsection    , the Department of Health may not maintain a                           restrictive drug formulary that restricts a physician s ability to treat a patient with a legend drug                           that has been approved and designated as safe and effective by the Federal Food and Drug                           Administration, except for drugs for cosmetic purposes.                                    When a multisource legend drug is available in the generic form, the Department of                           Health may only reimburse for the generic form of the drug unless                                 a   the treating physician demonstrates to the Department of Health a medical necessity                           for dispensing the nongeneric, brand name legend drug .   or                                b   reimbursement to the state for the brand name drug makes the brand name drug less                          expensive to the state than the cost of the generic form of the drug.                                    This section does not affect the state s ability to exercise the exclusion options                           available under the Federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of     .
