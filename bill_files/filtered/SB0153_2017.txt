Hillyard      House Sponsor   Val K. Potter             LONG TITLE      General Description            This bill modifies provisions related to calculating child support.       Highlighted Provisions             This bill                   addresses the impact of incarceration                   modifies how imputed income is calculated  and                  makes technical changes.       Money Appropriated in this Bill             None       Other Special Clauses             None       Utah Code Sections Affected        AMENDS               B       , as last amended by Laws of Utah     , Chapter                  Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah             Section  .  Section   B        is amended to read               B       . Determination of gross income    Imputed income.                 As used in the guidelines,  gross income  includes prospective income from any       source, including earned and nonearned income sources which may include salaries, wages,       commissions, royalties, bonuses, rents, gifts from anyone, prizes, dividends, severance pay,       pensions, interest, trust income, alimony from previous marriages, annuities, capital gains,       Social Security benefits, workers  compensation benefits, unemployment compensation,       income replacement disability insurance benefits, and payments from  nonmeans tested        government programs.                 Income from earned income sources is limited to the equivalent of one full time          hour job.  If and only if during the time  prior to  before the original support order, the       parent normally and consistently worked more than    hours at the parent s job, the court may       consider this extra time as a pattern in calculating the parent s ability to provide child support.                 Notwithstanding Subsection    , specifically excluded from gross income are              a   cash assistance provided under Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Family Employment       Program              b   benefits received under a housing subsidy program, the Job Training Partnership       Act,  Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicaid, SNAP       benefits, or General Assistance  and             c   other similar means tested welfare benefits received by a parent.                 a   Gross income from self employment or operation of a business shall be       calculated by subtracting necessary expenses required for self employment or business       operation from gross receipts.  The income and expenses from self employment or operation of       a business shall be reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the       parent to satisfy a child support award.  Only those expenses necessary to allow the business to       operate at a reasonable level may be deducted from gross receipts.             b   Gross income determined under this  subsection  Subsection     may differ from       the amount of business income determined for tax purposes.                 a   When possible, gross income should first be computed on an annual basis and       then recalculated to determine the average gross monthly income.             b   Each parent shall provide verification of current income.  Each parent shall provide       year to date pay stubs or employer statements and complete copies of tax returns from at least       the most recent year unless the court finds the verification is not reasonably available.        Verification of income from records maintained by the Department of Workforce Services may       be substituted for pay stubs, employer statements, and income tax returns.             c   Historical and current earnings shall be used to determine whether an       underemployment or overemployment situation exists.                 Incarceration of at least six months may not be treated as voluntary unemployment       by the office in establishing or modifying a support order.                       Gross income includes income imputed to the parent under Subsection                .                       a   Income may not be imputed to a parent unless the parent stipulates to the       amount imputed, the parent defaults, or, in contested cases, a hearing is held and the judge in a       judicial proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding enters findings of       fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.             b   If income is imputed to a parent, the income shall be based upon employment       potential and probable earnings  as derived from  considering, to the extent known              i   employment opportunities ,               ii   work history ,               iii   occupation qualifications ,               iv   educational attainment              v   literacy              vi   age              vii   health              viii   criminal record              ix   other employment barriers and background factors  and             x   prevailing earnings and job availability for persons of similar backgrounds in the       community , or the median earning for persons in the same occupation in the same       geographical area as found in the statistics maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .             c   If a parent has no recent work history or a parent s occupation is unknown,  income       shall be imputed at least  that parent may be imputed an income at the federal minimum wage       for a    hour work week.  To impute a greater or lesser income, the judge in a judicial       proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding shall enter specific findings       of fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.             d   Income may not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist and the       condition is not of a temporary nature              i   the reasonable costs of child care for the parents  minor children approach or equal       the amount of income the custodial parent can earn              ii   a parent is physically or mentally unable to earn minimum wage              iii   a parent is engaged in career or occupational training to establish basic job skills        or             iv   unusual emotional or physical needs of a child require the custodial parent s       presence in the home.                       a   Gross income may not include the earnings of a minor child who is the       subject of a child support award nor benefits to a minor child in the child s own right such as       Supplemental Security Income.              b   Social security benefits received by a child due to the earnings of a parent shall be        credited as child support to the parent upon whose earning record it is based, by crediting the        amount against the potential obligation of that parent.  Other unearned income of a child may        be considered as income to a parent depending upon the circumstances of each case.
