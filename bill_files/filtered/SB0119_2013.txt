Section      A            is amended to read                                   A       .  Youth court    Authorization    Referral.                                    Youth court is a diversion program which provides an alternative disposition for                           cases involving juvenile offenders in which youth participants, under the supervision of an                           adult coordinator, may serve in various capacities within the courtroom, acting in the role of                           jurors, lawyers, bailiffs, clerks, and judges.                                a   Youth who appear before youth courts have been identified by law enforcement                           personnel, school officials, a prosecuting attorney, or the juvenile court as having committed                           acts which indicate a need for intervention to prevent further development toward juvenile                           delinquency, but which appear to be acts that can be appropriately addressed outside the                           juvenile court process.                                b   Youth courts may only hear cases as provided for in this part.                                c   Youth court is a diversion program and not a court established under the Utah                           Constitution, Article VIII.                                    A youth court may not accept referrals from law enforcement, schools, prosecuting                          attorneys, or a juvenile court unless the youth court is certified by the Utah Youth Court Board.                                          Any person may refer youth to a youth court for minor offenses.  Once a                           referral is made, the case shall be screened by an adult coordinator to determine whether it                           qualifies as a youth court case.                                          Youth courts have authority over youth                                 a   referred for a minor offense or offenses, or who are granted permission for referral                           under this part                                 b   who, along with a parent, guardian, or legal custodian, voluntarily and in writing,                           request youth court involvement                                 c   who admit having committed the referred offense                                    d   who, along with a parent, guardian, or legal custodian, waive any privilege against                           self incrimination and right to a speedy trial  and                                e   who, along with their parent, guardian, or legal custodian, agree to follow the youth                           court disposition of the case.                                          Except with permission granted under Subsection          , youth courts may                           not exercise authority over youth who are under the continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court                           for law violations, including any youth who may have a matter pending which has not yet been                           adjudicated.  Youth courts may, however, exercise authority over youth who are under the                           continuing jurisdiction of the juvenile court as set forth in this Subsection           if the                           offense before the youth court is not a law violation, and the referring agency has notified the                           juvenile court of the referral.                                          Youth courts may exercise authority over youth described in Subsection                                   , and over any other offense with the permission of the juvenile court and the prosecuting                           attorney in the county or district that would have jurisdiction if the matter were referred to                           juvenile court.                                          Permission of the juvenile court may be granted by a probation officer of the                           court in the district that would have jurisdiction over the offense being referred to youth court.                                          Youth courts may decline to accept a youth for youth court disposition for any                           reason and may terminate a youth from youth court participation at any time.                                          A youth or the youth s parent, guardian, or legal custodian may withdraw from                           the youth court process at any time.  The youth court shall immediately notify the referring                           source of the withdrawal.                                           The youth court may transfer a case back to the referring source for                           alternative handling at any time.                                            Referral of a case  of  to youth court may not prohibit the subsequent                           referral of the case to any court.                                     Proceedings and dispositions of a youth court may only be shared with the                          referring agency, juvenile court, and victim.                                        When a person does not complete the terms ordered by a youth court, and the case                          is referred to a juvenile court, the youth court shall provide the case file to the juvenile court.
