reside, or work in the service area for the network plan  and                                 ii   within the service area of the network plan, deny coverage to an employer if the                            small employer carrier has demonstrated to the commissioner that the small employer carrier                                  A   will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to enrollees of any                            additional groups because of the small employer carrier s obligations to existing group contract                            holders and enrollees  and                                 B   applies this section uniformly to all employers without regard to                                  I   the claims experience of an employer, an employer s employee, or a

employee.                                 b   i   A small employer carrier that denies a health benefit product to an employer in                            any service area in accordance with this section may not offer coverage in the small employer                            market within the service area to any employer for a period of     days after the date the                            coverage is denied.                                 ii   This Subsection     b  does not                                  A   limit the small employer carrier s ability to renew coverage that is in force  or                                 B   relieve the small employer carrier of the responsibility to renew coverage that is in                            force.                                 c   Coverage offered within a service area after the     day period specified in                            Subsection     b  is subject to the requirements of this section.
