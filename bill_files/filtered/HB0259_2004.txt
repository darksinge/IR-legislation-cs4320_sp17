The prospective adoptive parent described in                           this Subsection     c  shall, however, obtain the information described in Subsections     a                            and  b , and file that documentation with the court prior to finalization of the adoption.                                d   The requirements of Subsection     a  are satisfied by a previous preplacement                           adoptive evaluation conducted within three years prior to placement of the child, or an annual                           updated adoptive evaluation conducted after that three year period or within one year after                           finalization of a previous adoption.                                    The preplacement adoptive evaluation shall include                                 a   criminal history record information regarding each prospective adoptive parent and                           any other adult living in the prospective home, received from the Criminal Investigations and                           Technical Services Division of the Department of Public Safety, in accordance with Section                                         , no earlier than    months immediately preceding placement of the child                                 b   a report from the Department of Human Services containing all information                           regarding reports and investigation of child abuse, neglect, and dependency, with respect to                           each prospective adoptive parent and any other adult living in the prospective home, obtained                           no earlier than    months immediately preceding placement of the child, pursuant to waivers                           executed by those parties   and                                 c   an evaluation conducted by an expert in family relations approved by the court or a                           certified social worker, clinical social worker, marriage and family therapist, psychologist,                           professional counselor, or other court determined expert in family relations, who is licensed to                           practice under the laws of this state or under the laws of the state where the prospective                           adoptive parent or other person living in the prospective  adoptive home resides.  The                           evaluation shall be in a form approved by the Department of Human Services.  Neither the                              Department of Human Services nor any of its divisions may proscribe who qualifies as an                           expert in family relations or who may conduct evaluations pursuant to this Subsection     .                            and                                d   if the child to be adopted is a child with special needs as defined in Section                               A  a    .     , the preplacement evaluation must be conducted by the Division of Child and                          Family Services or a licensed child placing agency which had entered into a contract with the                          division to conduct preplacement evaluations for children with special needs.                                    A copy of the preplacement adoptive evaluation shall be filed with the court.                                    a  Except as provided in Subsections     b  and  c , a postplacement evaluation                           shall be conducted and submitted to the court prior to the final hearing in an adoption                           proceeding. The postplacement evaluation shall include                                 i   verification of the allegations of fact contained in the petition for adoption                                 ii   an evaluation of the progress of the child s placement in the adoptive home  and                                iii   a recommendation regarding whether the adoption is in the best interest of the                           child.                                b   The exemptions from and requirements for evaluations, described in Subsections                               c ,     c , and    , also apply to postplacement adoptive evaluations.                                c   Upon the request of the petitioner, the court may waive the postplacement adoptive                           evaluation, unless it determines that it is in the best interest of the child to require the                           postplacement evaluation.                                    If the person or agency conducting the evaluation disapproves the adoptive                           placement, either in the preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation, the court may                           dismiss the petition. However, upon request of a prospective adoptive parent, the court shall                           order that an additional preplacement or postplacement adoptive evaluation be conducted, and                           hold a hearing on the suitability of the adoption, including testimony of interested parties.                                    Prior to finalization of a petition for adoption the court shall review and consider                           the information and recommendations contained in the preplacement and postplacement                           adoptive studies required by this section.
