Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM     This legislation raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns        This bill could be challenged as violating the First Amendment of the United States  Constitution and the comparable provisions of Utah s constitution.  However, at least one court    the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit    upheld an Ohio statute with similar  provisions when it was challenged on First Amendment grounds.  See, Toledo Area AFL CIO  Council v. Pizza,  th Cir., No.                  .  Although that case is not binding precedent on  Utah s state or federal courts, it affirmatively demonstrates both the possibility that this legislation  might be challenged on constitutional grounds and an analytical framework that a Utah court could  use to uphold its constitutionality.
