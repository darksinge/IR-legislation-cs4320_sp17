           This chapter is known as the  Lawful Commerce in Arms Act              Section     Section     d     is enacted to read                 d      Findings    Purpose                  The Legislature finds the following              a   the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the right of       the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed              b   the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the rights of       individuals  including those who are not members of a militia or engaged in military service or       training  to keep and bear arms              c   lawsuits have been commenced against manufacturers  distributors  dealers  and       importers of firearms that operate as designed and intended  which seek money damages and       other relief for the harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third parties  including criminals              d   the manufacture  importation  possession  sale  and use of firearms and ammunition       in the United States is heavily regulated by federal  state  and local laws  including the Gun       Control Act of          U S C  Sec       et seq   the National Firearms Act     U S C  Sec              et seq   the Arms Export Control Act     U S C  Sec        et seq   Title     Chapter          Regulation of Firearms  and Title     Chapter     Part    Weapons              e   businesses in the United States that are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce       through the lawful design  manufacture  marketing  distribution  importation  or sale to the       public of firearms or ammunition products that have been shipped or transported are not  and       should not be  liable for the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm       products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended              f   the possibility of imposing liability on an entire industry for harm that is solely       caused by others is an abuse of the legal system  erodes public confidence in our nation s laws        threatens a basic constitutional right and civil liberty  invites the disassembly and       destabilization of other industries and economic sectors lawfully competing in the free       enterprise system of the United States  and constitutes an unreasonable burden on interstate and       foreign commerce of the United States              g   i   the liability actions commenced or contemplated are based on theories without       foundation in hundreds of years of the common law and jurisprudence of the United States and       do not represent a bona fide expansion of the common law              ii   the possible sustaining of these actions by a maverick judicial officer or petit jury       would expand civil liability in a manner never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution        by Congress  or by the legislatures of the several states  and             iii   an expansion of liability would constitute a deprivation of the rights  privileges        and immunities guaranteed to a citizen of the United States under the Fourteenth Amendment       to the United States Constitution  and             h   the liability actions commenced or contemplated attempt to use the judicial branch       to circumvent the legislative branch of government to regulate interstate and foreign commerce       through judgments and judicial decrees thereby threatening the separation of powers doctrine       and weakening and undermining important principles of federalism  state sovereignty  and       comity between the sister states                  It is the purpose of this chapter to              a   limit causes of action against manufacturers  distributors  dealers  and importers of       firearms or ammunition products  and their trade associations  for the harm solely caused by the       criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by others when the       product functioned as designed and intended              b   preserve a citizen s access to a supply of firearms and ammunition for all lawful       purposes  including hunting  self defense  collecting  and competitive or recreational shooting              c   guarantee a citizen s rights  privileges  and immunities  as applied to the states        under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution              d   prevent the use of lawsuits to impose unreasonable burdens on interstate and       foreign commerce              e   protect the rights  under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution  of       manufacturers  distributors  dealers  and importers of firearms or ammunition products  and       trade associations  to speak freely  to assemble peaceably  and to petition the government for a       redress of their grievances  and             f   preserve and protect the separation of powers doctrine and important principles of       federalism  state sovereignty  and comity between sister states             Section     Section     d     is enacted to read                 d      Definitions
