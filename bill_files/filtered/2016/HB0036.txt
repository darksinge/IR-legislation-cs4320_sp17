            A   shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency  and               B   may impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a         material risk that the certified reinsurer s obligations will not be paid in full when due                vi   For purposes of this Subsection      a certified reinsurer whose certification has         been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure              of its obligations                A   As used in this Subsection      the term  terminated  refers to revocation          suspension  voluntary surrender  and inactive status                B   If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other         provisions

Subsection                    b   A claim is contingent if                i   the accident  casualty  disaster  loss  event  or occurrence insured  reinsured  or         bonded against occurs on or before the date fixed under Section    A   a        A   a              and               ii   the act or event triggering the insurer s obligation to pay has not occurred as of  the          that date  fixed under Section   A   a                     c   A claim is unliquidated if the insurer s obligation to pay is established  but the         amount of the claim has not been determined                    a   Unless the receivership court directs otherwise  a contingent claim may be         allowed if                i   the claimant presents proof of the insurer s obligation to pay reasonably satisfactory         to the liquidator  or               ii   subject to Subsection     b   the claim is based on a cause of action against an         insured of the insurer  and                A   it may be reasonably inferred from proof presented upon the claim that the         claimant would be able to obtain a judgment  and               B   the person furnishes suitable proof                b   A contingent claim may not be allowed under Subsection     a  ii  B  if the         receivership court for good cause shown shall otherwise direct that no further valid claims can         be made against the insurer arising out of the cause of action other than those already         presented                    a   An unliquidated claim may be allowed if its amount has been determined                b   If the amount of an unliquidated claim filed pursuant to Section   A   a             remains undetermined  the valuation of the unliquidated claim may be made by estimate         whenever the liquidator determines that                i   liquidation of the claim would unduly delay the administration of the liquidation         proceeding  or               ii   the administrative expense of processing and adjudicating the claim or group of         claims of a similar type would be unduly excessive when compared with the property that is         estimated to be available for distribution with respect to the claim                c   Any estimate shall be based on an accepted method of valuing a claim with         reasonable certainty at the claim s net present value  such as an actuarial evaluation                    a   Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section  a claim for the value or         breach of a life insurance policy  disability income insurance policy  long term care insurance         policy  or annuity may not result in or serve as the basis of any liability of a reinsurer of the         insurer                b   A reinsurer s liability to the insurer shall be determined exclusively on the basis of         its contracts of reinsurance and Section   A   a                        a   The liquidator may petition the receivership court to set a date certain before         which all claims under this section shall be final                b   In addition to the notice requirements of Section   A   a      the liquidator shall         give notice of the filing of the petition to all claimants with claims that remain contingent or         unliquidated under this section               Section      Section   A        is amended to read
