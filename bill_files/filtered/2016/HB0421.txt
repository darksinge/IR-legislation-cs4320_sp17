in this section   operative date of the valuation manual  means the same as         that term is described in Subsection   A                              In the case of policies issued on or after July          no policy of life insurance          except as stated in Subsection      may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it         contains in substance the following provisions  or corresponding provisions which in the         opinion of the commissioner are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering         policyholder as are the minimum requirements  hereinafter  specified in this section  and are         essentially in compliance with Subsection                    a   That  in the event of default in any premium payment  after premiums have been         paid for at least one full year the company will grant  upon proper request not later than    days         after the due date of the premium in default  a paid up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated         in the policy  effective as of such due date  of such amount as is specified in this section   In         lieu of that stipulated paid up nonforfeiture benefit  the company may substitute  upon proper         request not later than    days after the due date of the premium in default  an actuarially         equivalent alternative paid up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer         period of death benefits or  if applicable  a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment         benefits                b   That  upon surrender of the policy within    days after the due date of any premium         payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of         ordinary insurance or five full years in the case of industrial insurance  the company will pay          in lieu of any paid up nonforfeiture benefit  a cash surrender value of such amount as is         specified in this section                c   That a specified paid up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in         the policy unless the person entitled to make such election

payments         or if it is continued under any paid up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after         the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in         the case of industrial insurance  the company will pay upon surrender of the policy within            days after any policy anniversary  a cash surrender value in the amount specified in this section                e   In the case of policies which cause  on a basis guaranteed in the policy  unscheduled         changes in benefits or premiums  or which provide an option for changes in benefits or         premiums other than a change to a new policy  a statement of the mortality table  interest rate          and method used in calculating cash surrender values

cash surrender values and the paid up nonforfeiture         benefit  if any  available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first            policy years or during the term of the policy  whichever is shorter  such values and benefits to         be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid up additions credited to         the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the company on the policy                f   A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid up nonforfeiture benefits         available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or         pursuant to the insurance law of the state in which the policy is delivered  an explanation of the         manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by         the existence of any paid up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the         company on the policy  if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and         benefits shown in the policy is not stated  therein  in the policy  a statement that such method         of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the         policy is delivered  and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender         value and paid up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary         beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the         policy                g   Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the         plan of insurance may  to the extent inapplicable  be omitted from the policy                h   The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender         value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy with the         consent of the commissioner  provided  however  that the policy shall remain in full force and         effect until the insurer has made the payment                    a   Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a         premium payment due on any policy anniversary  whether or not required by Subsection              shall be an amount not less than the excess  if any  of the present value  on such anniversary  of         the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy  including any         existing paid up additions  if there had been no default  over the sum of                i   the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in Subsections     and              corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary          and               ii   the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy                b   Provided  however  that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of         Subsection     d  as defined  therein  in Subsection     d   which provides supplemental life         insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional         premium by rider or supplemental policy provision  the cash surrender value referred to in         Subsection     a  shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as         defined in Subsection     a  for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such         rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in Subsection             a  for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or         supplemental policy provision                c   Provided  further  that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of         Subsection     d  as defined  therein  in Subsection     d   which defines a primary insured         and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the         spouse s age     the cash surrender value referred to in Subsection     a  shall be an amount not         less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in Subsection     a  for an otherwise         similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and         the cash surrender value as defined in Subsection     a  for a policy which provides only the         benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse                d   Any cash surrender value available within    days after any policy anniversary         under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued         under any paid up nonforfeiture benefit  whether or not required by Subsection     shall be an         amount not less than the present value  on such anniversary  of the future guaranteed benefits         provided for by the policy  including any existing paid up additions  decreased by any         indebtedness to the company on the policy                    Any paid up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default         in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of         such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the         policy or  if none is provided for  that cash surrender value which would have been required by         this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a         specified period                    a   i   This Subsection     does not apply to policies issued on or after the operative         date of Subsection     d  as defined  therein  in Subsection     d                 ii   Except as provided in Subsection     c   the adjusted premiums for any policy shall         be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective         premiums specified in the policy for each policy year  excluding any extra premiums charged         because of impairments or special hazards  that the present value  at the date of issue of the         policy  of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of                A   the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy                B      of the amount of insurance  if the insurance be uniform in amount  or of the         equivalent uniform amount if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy                C       of the adjusted premium for the first policy year  and               D       of either the adjusted premium for the first

same amount of         insurance  whichever is less                iii   Provided  however  that in applying the percentages specified in Subsections             a  ii  C  and  D   no adjusted premium shall be considered to exceed    of the amount of         insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto   The date of issue of a policy for the purpose         of this Subsection     shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined                b   In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of         the policy  the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of this Subsection     shall         be considered to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy          containing the same endowment benefit or benefits  if any  issued at the same age and for the         same term  the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have         the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy  provided  however          that in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child         under age     the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of         insurance provided by the policy  prior to  before the attainment of age    were the amount         provided by such policy at age                   c   i   The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider         or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to the sum of

uniform amount of insurance         used in calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in  B  of Subsection      c  i   a  ii          shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over         the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in  A  of  this  Subsection             c  i                 d   Except as otherwise provided

net level premium shall be equal to the present value  at the         date of issue of the policy  of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the         present value  at the date of issue of the policy  of an annuity of one per annum payable on the         date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls         due
