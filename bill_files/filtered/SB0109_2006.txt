In addition, Chapter  , General Provisions, contains general definitions andprinciples of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter.      A  a    .     This chapter is subject to any treaty or statute of the United States or regulatorystatute of this state to the extent the treaty, statute, or regulatory statute is applicable.     This chapter does not modify or repeal any law prescribing the form or content of adocument of title or the services or facilities to be afforded by a bailee, or otherwise regulatinga bailee s business in respects not specifically treated in this chapter.  However, violation ofsuch a law does not affect the status of a document of title that otherwise is within thedefinition of a document of title.     This chapter modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures inGlobal and National Commerce Act     U.S.C. Section     , et seq.  but does not modify,limit, or supersede Section     c  of that act     U.S.C.

To the extent there is a conflict between Title   , Chapter  , Uniform ElectronicTransactions Act, and this chapter, this chapter governs.      A  a    .     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , a document of title is negotiable ifby its terms the goods are to be delivered to bearer or to the order of a named person.     A document of title other than one described in Subsection     is nonnegotiable.  Abill of lading that states that the goods are consigned to a named person is not made negotiableby a provision that the goods are to be delivered only against an order in a record signed by thesame or another named person.     A document of title is nonnegotiable if, at the time it is issued, the document has aconspicuous legend, however expressed, that it is nonnegotiable.      A  a    .     Upon request of a person entitled under an electronic document of title, the issuerof the electronic document may issue a tangible document of title as a substitute for theelectronic document if  a   the person entitled under the electronic document surrenders control of thedocument to the issuer  and b   the tangible document when issued contains a statement that it is issued insubstitution for the electronic document.     Upon issuance of a tangible document of title in substitution for an electronicdocument of title in accordance with Subsection      a   the electronic document ceases to have any effect or validity  and b   the person that procured issuance of the tangible document warrants to allsubsequent persons entitled under the tangible document that the warrantor was a personentitled under the electronic document when the warrantor surrendered control of the electronicdocument to the issuer.     Upon request of a person entitled under a tangible document of title, the issuer ofthe tangible document may issue an electronic document of title as a substitute for the tangibledocument if  a   the person entitled under the tangible document surrenders possession of thedocument to the issuer  and b   the electronic document when issued contains a statement that it is issued insubstitution for the tangible document.     Upon issuance of an electronic document of title in substitution for a tangibledocument of title in accordance with Subsection      a   the tangible document ceases to have any effect or validity  and b   the person that procured issuance of the electronic document warrants to allsubsequent persons entitled under the electronic document that the warrantor was a personentitled under the tangible document when the warrantor surrendered possession of the tangibledocument to the issuer.      A  a    .     A person has control of an electronic document of title if a system employed forevidencing the transfer of interests in the electronic document reliably establishes that personas the person to which the electronic document was issued or transferred.     A system satisfies Subsection    , and a person is considered to have control of anelectronic document of title, if the document is created, stored, and assigned in such a mannerthat  a   a single authoritative copy of the document exists which is unique, identifiable,and, except as otherwise provided in Subsections     d ,  e , and  f , unalterable  b   the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as  i   the person to which the document was issued  or ii   if the authoritative copy indicates that the document has been transferred, theperson to which the document was most recently transferred  c   the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person assertingcontrol or its designated custodian  d   copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritativecopy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control  e   each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable asa copy that is not the authoritative copy  and f   any amendment of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized orunauthorized.      A  a    .     A warehouse receipt may be issued by any warehouse.     If goods, including distilled spirits and agricultural commodities, are stored under astatute requiring a bond against withdrawal or a license for the issuance of receipts in thenature of warehouse receipts, a receipt issued for the goods is considered to be a warehousereceipt even if issued by a person that is the owner of the goods and is not a warehouse.      A  a    .     A warehouse receipt need not be in any particular form.     Unless a warehouse receipt provides for each of the following, the warehouse isliable for damages caused to a person injured by its omission  a   a statement of the location of the warehouse facility where the goods are stored  b   the date of issue of the receipt  c   the unique identification code of the receipt  d   a statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a namedperson, or to a named person or that person s order  e   the rate of storage and handling charges, unless goods are stored under a fieldwarehousing arrangement, in which case a statement of that fact is sufficient on anonnegotiable receipt  f   a description of the goods or the packages containing them  g   the signature of the warehouse or its agent  h   if the receipt is issued for goods that the warehouse owns, either solely, jointly, orin common with others, a statement of the fact of that ownership  and i   a statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred for which thewarehouse claims a lien or security interest, unless the precise amount of advances made orliabilities incurred, at the time of the issue of the receipt, is unknown to the warehouse or to itsagent that issued the receipt, in which case a statement of the fact that advances have beenmade or liabilities incurred and the purpose of the advances or liabilities is sufficient.     A warehouse may insert in its receipt any terms that are not contrary to this title anddo not impair its obligation of delivery under Section       A  a         or its duty of care underSection       A  a        .  Any contrary provision is ineffective.      A  a    .A party to or purchaser for value in good faith of a document of title, other than a bill oflading, that relies upon the description of the goods in the document may recover from theissuer damages caused by the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extentthat      the document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all orpart of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in whichthe description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition, or the receipt ordescription is qualified by  contents, condition, and quality unknown,   said to contain,  orwords of similar import, if the indication is true  or     the party or purchaser otherwise has notice of the nonreceipt or misdescription.      A  a    .     A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by itsfailure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exerciseunder similar circumstances.  Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damagesthat could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.     Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreementlimiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is notliable.  Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse s liability for conversionto its own use.  On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreementor within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse s liability maybe increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehousereceipt.  In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of thegoods.     Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims andcommencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storageagreement.      A  a    .A buyer in ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by awarehouse that is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes the goods free ofany claim under a warehouse receipt even if the receipt is negotiable and has been dulynegotiated.      A  a    .     A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are heldand any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of anycharges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period ofstorage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not lessthan    days after the warehouse gives notice.  If the goods are not removed before the datespecified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to Section       A  a        .     If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or declinein value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in Subsection     andSection       A  a        , the warehouse may specify in the notice given under Subsection     anyreasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sellthem at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.     If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did nothave notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehousefacilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale withoutadvertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest inthe goods.  If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it maydispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.     A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under thischapter upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.     A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition underthis section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which thewarehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.      A  a    .     Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separatethe goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery ofthose goods.  However, different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.     If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in commonby the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for thatowner s share.  If, because of overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all thereceipts the warehouse has issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to whichoverissued receipts have been duly negotiated.      A  a    .If a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in withoutauthority, a good faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treatthe insertion as authorized.  Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronicwarehouse receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.      A  a    .     A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehousereceipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storageor transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges,present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of thegoods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  If the person on whose account thegoods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods wheneverdeposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimedfor charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against thegoods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in itspossession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been deliveredby the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt isduly negotiated, a warehouse s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified inthe warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage ofthe specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.     A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for themaximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in Subsection   , such as for money advanced and interest.  The security interest is governed by Chapter  a,Uniform Commercial Code   Secured Transactions.     A warehouse s lien for charges and expenses under Subsection     or a securityinterest under Subsection     is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailorwith possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith purchaser forvalue would have been valid.  However, the lien or security interest is not effective against aperson that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected securityinterest in the goods and that did not  a   deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to thebailor or the bailor s nominee with  i   actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell  ii   power to obtain delivery under Section       A  a          or iii   power of disposition under Section       A          , Subsection       A  a           ,Subsection       A  a           , Section       A  a        , or Subsection       A  a            or other statuteor rule of law  or b   acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.     A warehouse s lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to thegoods under Subsection     is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legalpossessor of the goods at the time of deposit.  In this Subsection    ,  household goods  meansfurniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.     A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiablyrefuses to deliver.      A  a    .     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , a warehouse s lien may be enforcedby public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on anyterms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interestin the goods.  The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of theproposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could havebeen obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by thewarehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commerciallyreasonable manner.  The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if thewarehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at theprice current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity withcommercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of moregoods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is notcommercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.     A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchantin the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied  a   All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified. b   The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description ofthe goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than tendays after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paidwithin that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified timeand place. c   The sale must conform to the terms of the notification. d   The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held orstored. e   After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of thesale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of generalcirculation where the sale is to be held.  The advertisement must include a description of thegoods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time andplace of the sale.  The sale must take place at least    days after the first publication.  If there isno newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must beposted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six conspicuous places in theneighborhood of the proposed sale.     Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goodsmay pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred incomplying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained bythe warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this chapter.     A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.     A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse s lien takes thegoods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse snoncompliance with this section.     A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to thissection but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which thewarehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.     The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by lawto a creditor against a debtor.     If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien maybe enforced in accordance with Subsection     or    .     A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with therequirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable forconversion.      A  a    .     A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith,or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description ofthe goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damagescaused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except tothe extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of thegoods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which thedescription is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt ordescription is qualified by  contents or condition of contents of packages unknown,   said tocontain,   shipper s weight, load, and count,  or words of similar import, if that indication istrue.     If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading  a   the issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain thekind and quantity if shipped in bulk  and b   words such as  shipper s weight, load, and count,  or words of similar importindicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goodsconcealed in packages.     If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill oflading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind andquantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper s request in a record to do so.  Inthat case,  shipper s weight  or words of similar import are ineffective.     The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words  shipper s weight,load, and count,  or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by theshipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by theimproper loading.  However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damagescaused by improper loading.     A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of thedescription, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by theshipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies inthose particulars.  This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer s responsibility or liabilityunder the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.      A  a    .     The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying anundertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, isliable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the otherperson or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document.  However, tothe extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or interritory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including mattersother than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carriermay be varied by agreement of the parties.     If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodyingan undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by thatperson, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in itspossession, to the obligation of the issuer.  The person s obligation is discharged by delivery ofthe goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liabilityfor breach by any other person or by the issuer.     The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described inSubsection     is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possessionof the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred  a   the amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill orother document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript ofjudgment  and b   the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending anyaction commenced by any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for thebreach.      A  a    .     Unless the bill of lading otherwise provides, a carrier may deliver the goods to aperson or destination other than that stated in the bill or may otherwise dispose of the goods,without liability for misdelivery, on instructions from  a   the holder of a negotiable bill  b   the consignor on a nonnegotiable bill, even if the consignee has given contraryinstructions  c   the consignee on a nonnegotiable bill in the absence of contrary instructions fromthe consignor, if the goods have arrived at the billed destination or if the consignee is inpossession of the tangible bill or in control of the electronic bill  or d   the consignee on a nonnegotiable bill, if the consignee is entitled as against theconsignor to dispose of the goods.     Unless instructions described in Subsection     are included in a negotiable bill oflading, a person to which the bill is duly negotiated may hold the bailee according to theoriginal terms.      A  a    .     Except as customary in international transportation, a tangible bill of lading maynot be issued in a set of parts.  The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of thisSubsection    .     If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which containsan identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been deliveredagainst any other part, the whole of the parts constitutes one bill.     If a tangible negotiable bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and differentparts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiationis made prevails as to both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder mayhave received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier s obligation bysurrendering its part.     A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issuedin a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set.     The bailee shall deliver in accordance with Chapter  , Uniform Commercial Code  Bank Deposits and Collections, against the first presented part of a tangible bill of ladinglawfully issued in a set.  Delivery in this manner discharges the bailee s obligation on the wholebill.      A  a    .     Instead of issuing a bill of lading to the consignor at the place of shipment, acarrier, at the request of the consignor, may procure the bill to be issued at destination or at anyother place designated in the request.     Upon request of any person entitled as against a carrier to control the goods whilein transit and on surrender of possession or control of any outstanding bill of lading or otherreceipt covering the goods, the issuer, subject to Section       A  a        , may procure a substitutebill to be issued at any place designated in the request.      A  a    .An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the billenforceable according to its original tenor.      A  a    .     A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceedsthereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier s receipt of the goods forstorage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expensesnecessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred intheir sale pursuant to law.  However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading,a carrier s lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no chargesare stated, a reasonable charge.     A lien for charges and expenses under Subsection     on goods that the carrier wasrequired by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any personentitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subjectthe goods to those charges and expenses.  Any other lien under Subsection     is effectiveagainst the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession ofthe goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.     A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiablyrefuses to deliver.      A  a    .     A carrier s lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, inbulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable,after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification mustinclude a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and placeof any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a differenttime or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient toestablish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sellsgoods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner inany recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale,or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in thetype of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensuresatisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by thepreceding sentence.     Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goodsmay pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred incomplying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained bythe carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this chapter.     A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.     A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier s lien takes the goodsfree of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier snoncompliance with this section.     A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this sectionbut shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrierwould have been bound to deliver the goods.     The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by lawto a creditor against a debtor.     A carrier s lien may be enforced pursuant to either Subsection     or the procedureset forth in Subsection       A  a           .     A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirementsfor sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.      A  a    .     A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shallexercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person wouldexercise under similar circumstances.  This Subsection     does not affect any statute,regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not causedby its negligence.     Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportationagreement that the carrier s liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportationagreement if the carrier s rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded anopportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity. However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier s liability for conversionto its own use.     Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims andcommencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or atransportation agreement.      A  a    .The obligations imposed by this chapter on an issuer apply to a document of title evenif      the document does not comply with the requirements of this chapter or of any otherstatute, rule, or regulation regarding its issuance, form, or content      the issuer violated laws regulating the conduct of its business      the goods covered by the document were owned by the bailee when the documentwas issued  or     the person issuing the document is not a warehouse but the document purports to bea warehouse receipt.      A  a    .A duplicate or any other document of title purporting to cover goods alreadyrepresented by an outstanding document of the same issuer does not confer any right in thegoods, except as provided in the case of tangible bills of lading in a set of parts, overissue ofdocuments for fungible goods, substitutes for lost, stolen, or destroyed documents, or substitutedocuments issued pursuant to Section       A  a        .  The issuer is liable for damages caused byits overissue or failure to identify a duplicate document by a conspicuous notation.      A  a    .     A bailee shall deliver the goods to a person entitled under a document of title if theperson complies with Subsections     and    , unless and to the extent that the baileeestablishes any of the following  a   delivery of the goods to a person whose receipt was rightful as against the claimant  b   damage to or delay, loss, or destruction of the goods for which the bailee is notliable  c   previous sale or other disposition of the goods in lawful enforcement of a lien or ona warehouse s lawful termination of storage  d   the exercise by a seller of its right to stop delivery pursuant to Section       A         or by a lessor of its right to stop delivery pursuant to Section       A  a          e   a diversion, reconsignment, or other disposition pursuant to Section       A  a          f   release, satisfaction, or any other personal defense against the claimant  or g   any other lawful excuse.     A person claiming goods covered by a document of title shall satisfy the bailee slien if the bailee so requests or if the bailee is prohibited by law from delivering the goods untilthe charges are paid.     Unless a person claiming the goods is a person against which the document of titledoes not confer a right under Subsection       A  a            a   a   the person claiming under a document shall surrender possession or control of anyoutstanding negotiable document covering the goods for cancellation or indication of partialdeliveries  and b   the bailee shall cancel the document or conspicuously indicate in the document thepartial delivery or the bailee is liable to any person to which the document is duly negotiated.      A  a    .A bailee that in good faith has received goods and delivered or otherwise disposed ofthe goods according to the terms of a document of title or pursuant to this chapter is not liablefor the goods even if      the person from which the bailee received the goods did not have authority toprocure the document or to dispose of the goods  or     the person to which the bailee delivered the goods did not have authority to receivethe goods.      A  a    .     The following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title  a   If the document s original terms run to the order of a named person, the document isnegotiated by the named person s indorsement and delivery.  After the named person sindorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone. b   If the document s original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone. c   If the document s original terms run to the order of a named person and it isdelivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated. d   Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requiresindorsement by the named person and delivery. e   A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in thisSubsection     to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense againstor claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that thenegotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving thedocument in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.     The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title  a   If the document s original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, thedocument is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person.  Indorsement by thenamed person is not required to negotiate the document. b   If the document s original terms run to the order of a named person and the namedperson has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had beennegotiated. c   A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in thissubsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against orclaim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiationis not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the documentin settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.     Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document of title neither makes it negotiable noradds to the transferee s rights.     The naming in a negotiable bill of lading of a person to be notified of the arrival ofthe goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of thebill of any interest of that person in the goods.      A  a    .     Subject to Sections       A  a         and       A  a        , a holder to which a negotiabledocument of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby  a   title to the document  b   title to the goods  c   all rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goodsdelivered to the bailee after the document was issued  and d   the direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to theterms of the document free of any defense or claim by the issuer except those arising under theterms of the document or under this chapter, but in the case of a delivery order, the bailee sobligation accrues only upon the bailee s acceptance of the delivery order and the obligationacquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the acceptance of thebailee.     Subject to Section       A  a        , title and rights acquired by due negotiation are notdefeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document of title or by surrender ofthe goods by the bailee and are not impaired even if  a   the due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty  b   any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document orcontrol of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake,duress, loss, theft, or conversion  or c   a previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a thirdperson.      A  a    .     A document of title confers no right in goods against a person that before issuanceof the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that didnot  a   deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to thebailor or the bailor s nominee with  i   actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell  ii   power to obtain delivery under Section       A  a          or iii   power of disposition under Section       A          , Subsection       A  a           ,Subsection       A  a           , Section       A  a        , or Subsection       A  a            or other statuteor rule of law  or b   acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.     Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights ofany person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods hasbeen duly negotiated.  That title may be defeated under Section       A  a         to the same extentas the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.     Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject tothe rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated. However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with Part  , Warehouse Receipts and Bills ofLading  General Obligations, pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier sobligation to deliver.      A  a    .     A transferee of a document of title, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, to whichthe document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights that itstransferor had or had actual authority to convey.     In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after thebailee receives notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated  a   by those creditors of the transferor which could treat the transfer as void underSection       A           or       A  a          b   by a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee hasdelivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of the buyer s rights  c   by a lessee from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee hasdelivered the goods to the lessee or received notification of the lessee s rights  or d   as against the bailee, by good faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.     A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in anonnegotiable bill of lading which causes the bailee not to deliver the goods to the consigneedefeats the consignee s title to the goods if the goods have been delivered to a buyer in ordinarycourse of business or a lessee in ordinary course of business and, in any event, defeats theconsignee s rights against the bailee.     Delivery of the goods pursuant to a nonnegotiable document of title may be stoppedby a seller under Section       A           or a lessor under Section       A  a        , subject to therequirements of due notification in those sections.  A bailee that honors the seller s or lessor sinstructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller or lessor against any resulting loss orexpense.      A  a    .The indorsement of a tangible document of title issued by a bailee does not make theindorser liable for any default by the bailee or previous indorsers.      A  a    .The transferee of a negotiable tangible document of title has a specifically enforceableright to have its transferor supply any necessary indorsement, but the transfer becomes anegotiation only as of the time the indorsement is supplied.      A  a    .If a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, otherwise than as a mereintermediary under Section       A  a        , unless otherwise agreed, the transferor, in addition toany warranty made in selling or leasing the goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser onlythat      the document is genuine      the transferor does not have knowledge of any fact that would impair thedocument s validity or worth  and     the negotiation or delivery is rightful and fully effective with respect to the title tothe document and the goods it represents.      A  a    .A collecting bank or other intermediary known to be entrusted with documents of titleon behalf of another or with collection of a draft or other claim against delivery of documentswarrants by the delivery of the documents only its own good faith and authority even if thecollecting bank or other intermediary has purchased or made advances against the claim ordraft to be collected.      A  a    .Whether a document of title is adequate to fulfill the obligations of a contract for sale, acontract for lease, or the conditions of a letter of credit is determined by Chapter  , UniformCommercial Code   Sales,  a, Uniform Commercial Code   Leases, or  , Uniform CommercialCode   Letters of Credit.      A  a    .     If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order delivery of thegoods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any personcomply with the order.  If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of thegoods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant s posting security unless itfinds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control ofthe document is adequately protected against the loss.  If the document was nonnegotiable, thecourt may require security.  The court may also order payment of the bailee s reasonable costsand attorney s fees in any action under this Subsection    .     A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under amissing negotiable document of title is liable to any person injured thereby.  If the delivery isnot in good faith, the bailee is liable for conversion.  Delivery in good faith is not conversion ifthe claimant posts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goodsat the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery which files a notice ofclaim within one year after the delivery.      A  a    .Unless a document of title was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a personthat did not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicialprocess to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title isoutstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee orthe document s negotiation is enjoined.  The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the goodspursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the bailee orto the court.  A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process or injunctiontakes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.      A  a    .If more than one person claims title to or possession of the goods, the bailee is excusedfrom delivery until the bailee has a reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverseclaims or to commence an action for interpleader.  The bailee may assert an interpleader eitherin defending an action for nondelivery of the goods or by original action.

Each provision of this chapter with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the                            seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods                            except where the provision refers to such title.  In so far as situations are not covered by the                            other provisions of this chapter and matters concerning title become material the following                            rules apply                                         Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to                            the contract  Section       A           , and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by                            their identification a special property as limited by this act.  Any retention or reservation by the                            seller of the title  property  in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a                            reservation of a security interest.  Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the                            chapter on Secured Transactions  Chapter      a , title to goods passes from the seller to the                            buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.                                     Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at                            which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the                            goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be                            delivered at a different time or place  and in particular and despite any reservation of a security                            interest by the bill of lading                                  a   if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but                            does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and                            place of shipment  but                                 b   if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.                                     Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the                            goods ,                                   a   if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when                            and the place where he delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic                           document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document  or                                 b   if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of                           title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.                                     A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or                            not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller.  Such                            revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a  sale.                                 Section  .    Section      A           is amended to read                                    A      .  Power to transfer    Good faith purchase of goods    Definition of                               entrusting.                                     A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to                            transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the                            interest purchased.  A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good                            faith purchaser for value.  When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the                            purchaser has such power even though                                  a   the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser                                  b   the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored                                  c   it was agreed that the transaction was to be a  cash sale   or                                 d   the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal                            law.                                     Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that                            kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of                            business.                                      Entrusting  includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession                            regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and                            regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor s disposition of the                            goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.                                     The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by                            Chapter  a, Uniform Commercial Code   Secured Transactions and Chapter   , Uniform                           Commercial Code     a, Uniform Commercial Code   Documents of Title.                                Section   .    Section      A           is amended to read                                    A      .  Manner of seller s tender of delivery.                                     Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the                            buyer s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to                            take delivery.  The manner, time, and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this                            chapter, and in particular                                  a   tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods, they must be kept                               available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession  but                                 b   unless otherwise agreed, the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the                            receipt of the goods.                                     Where the case is within the next section, respecting shipment tender requires that                            the seller comply with its provisions.                                     Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination, tender requires                            that he comply with Subsection     and also in any appropriate case tender documents as                            described in Subsections     and     of this section.

His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing                            agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller s expectation of transferring that                            interest to the person named .   and                                 b   a nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the                            goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery   Subsection     of Section                                A             as provided in Subsection       A             , a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming                            the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or                           control of the bill of lading.                                     When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of                            the contract for sale, it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding                            section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the                            goods to the contract nor the seller s powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.

A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying                            documents or the proceeds of either                                  a   in case of an item deposited in an account, to the extent to which credit given for                            the item has been withdrawn or applied                                  b   in case of an item for which it has given credit available for withdrawal as of right,                            to the extent of the credit given, whether or not the credit is drawn upon or there is a right of                            charge back  or                                 c   if it makes an advance on or against the item.                                     If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single                            agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any                            accompanying documents or the proceeds of either.

Unless a warehouse receipt provides for each of the following, the warehouse is                            liable for damages caused to a person injured by its omission                                   a   a statement of the location of the warehouse facility where the goods are stored                                   b   the date of issue of the receipt                                   c   the unique identification code of the receipt                                   d   a statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a named                            person, or to a named person or that person s order                                   e   the rate of storage and handling charges, unless goods are stored under a field                            warehousing arrangement, in which case a statement of that fact is sufficient on a                            nonnegotiable receipt                                   f   a description of the goods or the packages containing them                                   g   the signature of the warehouse or its agent                                   h   if the receipt is issued for goods that the warehouse owns, either solely, jointly, or                            in common with others, a statement of the fact of that ownership  and                                  i   a statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred for which the                            warehouse claims a lien or security interest, unless the precise amount of advances made or                            liabilities incurred, at the time of the issue of the receipt, is unknown to the warehouse or to its                            agent that issued the receipt, in which case a statement of the fact that advances have been                            made or liabilities incurred and the purpose of the advances or liabilities is sufficient.                                         A warehouse may insert in its receipt any terms that are not contrary to this title and                            do not impair its obligation of delivery under Section       A  a         or its duty of care under                            Section       A  a        .  Any contrary provision is ineffective.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Liability for nonreceipt or misdescription.                                 A party to or purchaser for value in good faith of a document of title, other than a bill of                            lading, that relies upon the description of the goods in the document may recover from the                            issuer damages caused by the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent                            that                                       the document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all or                            part of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in which                            the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition, or the receipt or                            description is qualified by  contents, condition, and quality unknown,   said to contain,  or                            words of similar import, if the indication is true  or                                      the party or purchaser otherwise has notice of the nonreceipt or misdescription.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Duty of care    Contractual limitation of warehouse s liability.                                      A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its                            failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise                            under similar circumstances.  Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages                            that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.                                      Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement                            limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not                            liable.  Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse s liability for conversion                            to its own use.  On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement                            or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse s liability may                            be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse                            receipt.  In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the                               goods.                                      Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and                            commencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage                            agreement.

A buyer in ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by a                            warehouse that is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes the goods free of                            any claim under a warehouse receipt even if the receipt is negotiable and has been duly                            negotiated.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Termination of storage at warehouse s option.                                      A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held                            and any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any                            charges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of                            storage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not less                            than    days after the warehouse gives notice.  If the goods are not removed before the date                            specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to Section       A  a        .                                      If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline                            in value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in Subsection     and                            Section       A  a        , the warehouse may specify in the notice given under Subsection     any                            reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell                            them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.                                      If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not                            have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse                            facilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without                            advertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in                            the goods.  If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may                               dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.                                      A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this                            chapter upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.                                      A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under                            this section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which the                            warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Goods must be kept separate    Fungible goods.                                      Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separate                            the goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of                            those goods.  However, different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.                                      If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common                            by the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that                            owner s share.  If, because of overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the                            receipts the warehouse has issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to which                            overissued receipts have been duly negotiated.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Altered warehouse receipts.                                 If a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in without                            authority, a good faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treat                            the insertion as authorized.  Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronic                            warehouse receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Lien of warehouse.                                      A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse                            receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage                            or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges,                            present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the                               goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  If the person on whose account the                            goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever                            deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed                            for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the                            goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its                            possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered                            by the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is                            duly negotiated, a warehouse s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in                            the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of                            the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.                                      A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the                            maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in Subsection                               , such as for money advanced and interest.  The security interest is governed by Chapter  a,                            Uniform Commercial Code   Secured Transactions.                                      A warehouse s lien for charges and expenses under Subsection     or a security                            interest under Subsection     is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor                            with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith purchaser for                            value would have been valid.  However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a                            person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security                            interest in the goods and that did not                                   a   deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the                            bailor or the bailor s nominee with                                   i   actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell                                   ii   power to obtain delivery under Section       A  a          or                                  iii   power of disposition under Section       A          , Subsection       A  a           ,                            Subsection       A  a           , Section       A  a        , or Subsection       A  a            or other statute                            or rule of law  or                                  b   acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.                                         A warehouse s lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the                            goods under Subsection     is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal                            possessor of the goods at the time of deposit.  In this Subsection    ,  household goods  means                            furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.                                      A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably                            refuses to deliver.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Enforcement of warehouse s lien.                                      Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , a warehouse s lien may be enforced                            by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any                            terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest                            in the goods.  The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the                            proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have                            been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the                            warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially                            reasonable manner.  The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the                            warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the                            price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with                            commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more                            goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not                            commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.                                      A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant                            in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied                                   a   All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.                                  b   The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of                            the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten                            days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid                            within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time                               and place.                                  c   The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.                                  d   The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or                            stored.                                  e   After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the                            sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general                            circulation where the sale is to be held.  The advertisement must include a description of the                            goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and                            place of the sale.  The sale must take place at least    days after the first publication.  If there is                            no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be                            posted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six conspicuous places in the                            neighborhood of the proposed sale.                                      Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods                            may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in                            complying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by                            the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this chapter.                                      A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.                                      A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse s lien takes the                            goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse s                            noncompliance with this section.                                      A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this                            section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the                            warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.                                      The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law                            to a creditor against a debtor.                                      If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may                            be enforced in accordance with Subsection     or    .                                      A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the                               requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for                            conversion.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                              Part  .  Bills of Lading   Special Provisions                                    A  a    .  Liability for nonreceipt or misdescription     Said to contain                                  Shipper s weight, load, and count     Improper handling.                                      A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith,                            or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of                            the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages                            caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to                            the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the                            goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the                            description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or                            description is qualified by  contents or condition of contents of packages unknown,   said to                            contain,   shipper s weight, load, and count,  or words of similar import, if that indication is                            true.                                      If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading                                   a   the issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the                            kind and quantity if shipped in bulk  and                                  b   words such as  shipper s weight, load, and count,  or words of similar import                            indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods                            concealed in packages.                                      If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of                            lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and                            quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper s request in a record to do so.  In                            that case,  shipper s weight  or words of similar import are ineffective.                                      The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words  shipper s weight,                            load, and count,  or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the                               shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the                            improper loading.  However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages                            caused by improper loading.                                      A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the                            description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the                            shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in                            those particulars.  This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer s responsibility or liability                            under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying an                            undertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, is                            liable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the other                            person or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document.  However, to                            the extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in                            territory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters                            other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier                            may be varied by agreement of the parties.                                      If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying                            an undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that                            person, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its                            possession, to the obligation of the issuer.  The person s obligation is discharged by delivery of                            the goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liability                            for breach by any other person or by the issuer.                                      The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in                            Subsection     is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possession                            of the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred                                   a   the amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill or                               other document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript of                            judgment  and                                  b   the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending any                            action commenced by any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the                            breach.

Unless instructions described in Subsection     are included in a negotiable bill of                            lading, a person to which the bill is duly negotiated may hold the bailee according to the                            original terms.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Tangible bills of lading in a set.                                      Except as customary in international transportation, a tangible bill of lading may                            not be issued in a set of parts.  The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this                            Subsection    .                                      If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which contains                            an identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered                               against any other part, the whole of the parts constitutes one bill.                                      If a tangible negotiable bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and different                            parts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiation                            is made prevails as to both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder may                            have received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier s obligation by                            surrendering its part.                                      A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issued                            in a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set.                                      The bailee shall deliver in accordance with Chapter  , Uniform Commercial Code                              Bank Deposits and Collections, against the first presented part of a tangible bill of lading                            lawfully issued in a set.  Delivery in this manner discharges the bailee s obligation on the whole                            bill.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Destination bills.                                      Instead of issuing a bill of lading to the consignor at the place of shipment, a                            carrier, at the request of the consignor, may procure the bill to be issued at destination or at any                            other place designated in the request.                                      Upon request of any person entitled as against a carrier to control the goods while                            in transit and on surrender of possession or control of any outstanding bill of lading or other                            receipt covering the goods, the issuer, subject to Section       A  a        , may procure a substitute                            bill to be issued at any place designated in the request.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Altered bills of lading.                                 An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the bill                            enforceable according to its original tenor.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Lien of carrier.                                      A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds                               thereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier s receipt of the goods for                            storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses                            necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in                            their sale pursuant to law.  However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading,                            a carrier s lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges                            are stated, a reasonable charge.                                      A lien for charges and expenses under Subsection     on goods that the carrier was                            required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person                            entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject                            the goods to those charges and expenses.  Any other lien under Subsection     is effective                            against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession of                            the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.                                      A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably                            refuses to deliver.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Enforcement of carrier s lien.                                      A carrier s lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in                            bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable,                            after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification must                            include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place                            of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different                            time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to                            establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sells                            goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in                            any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale,                            or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the                            type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure                            satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the                               preceding sentence.                                      Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods                            may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in                            complying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by                            the carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this chapter.                                      A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.                                      A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier s lien takes the goods                            free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier s                            noncompliance with this section.                                      A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section                            but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier                            would have been bound to deliver the goods.                                      The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law                            to a creditor against a debtor.

A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements                            for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.                                 Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                    A  a    .  Duty of care    Contractual limitation of carrier s liability.                                      A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall                            exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would                            exercise under similar circumstances.  This Subsection     does not affect any statute,                            regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused                            by its negligence.                                      Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation                            agreement that the carrier s liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation                            agreement if the carrier s rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an                               opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity.                             However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier s liability for conversion                            to its own use.                                      Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and                            commencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a                            transportation agreement.

Rules for determining whether certain obligations and interests are                             securities or financial assets.                                      A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock                             company, or similar entity is a security.                                      An  investment company security  is a security.   Investment company security                                 means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment                             company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that                             is so registered, or a face amount certificate issued by a face amount certificate company that is                             so registered.  Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or                             endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company.                                      An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is                             dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide                             that it is a security governed by this chapter, or it is an investment company security.  However,                             an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a                             securities account.                                      A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this chapter and not by                             Chapter  , Uniform Commercial Code   Negotiable Instruments, even though it also meets the                             requirements of that chapter.  However, a negotiable instrument governed by Chapter   is a                             financial asset if it is held in a securities account.                                      An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is                             not a security, but is a financial asset.                                      A commodity contract, as defined in Subsection       A  a            , is not a security                             or a financial asset.                                      A document of title is not a financial asset unless Subsection       A              i  i  C                             applies.                                 Section   .

A secured party may perfect a security                             interest in certificated securities by taking delivery of the certificated securities under Section                                A          .                                      With respect to goods covered by a certificate of title issued by this state, a secured                             party may perfect a security interest in the goods by taking possession of the goods only in the                             circumstances described in Subsection       A  a           .                                      With respect to collateral other than certificated securities and goods covered by a                             document, a secured party takes possession of collateral in the possession of a person other                             than the debtor, the secured party, or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary                             course of the debtor s business, when                                   a   the person in possession authenticates a record acknowledging that it holds                             possession of the collateral for the secured party s benefit  or                                  b   the person takes possession of the collateral after having authenticated a record                             acknowledging that it will hold possession of collateral for the secured party s benefit.                                      If perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by a                             secured party, perfection occurs no earlier than the time the secured party takes possession and                                continues only while the secured party retains possession.

A person in possession of collateral is not required to acknowledge that it holds                             possession for a secured party s benefit.

A secured party having possession of collateral does not relinquish possession by                             delivering the collateral to a person other than the debtor or a lessee of the collateral from the                             debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor s business if the person was instructed before the                             delivery or is instructed contemporaneously with the delivery                                   a   to hold possession of the collateral for the secured party s benefit  or                                  b   to redeliver the collateral to the secured party.                                      A secured party does not relinquish possession, even if a delivery under Subsection                                 violates the rights of a debtor.  A person to which collateral is delivered under Subsection                                 does not owe any duty to the secured party and is not required to confirm the delivery to                             another person unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this chapter otherwise                             provides.
