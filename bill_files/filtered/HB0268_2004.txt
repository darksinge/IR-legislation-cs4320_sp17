Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody                           consideration.                                    If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is                           declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the                           minor children as it considers appropriate.                                a   In determining any form of custody, the court shall consider the best interests of the                           child and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the following                                 i   the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties                                 ii   which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including                           allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent  and                                iii   those factors outlined in Section            .     .                                b   The court shall, in every case, consider joint custody but may award any form of                           custody which is determined to be in the best interest of the child.                                c   The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact                           determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the                           children be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.                                d   The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s                           desires regarding future custody or parent time schedules, but the expressed desires are not                           controlling and the court may determine the children s custody or parent time otherwise.  The                           desires of a child    years of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single                           controlling factor.                                e   If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection                               d , they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be                           obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only                           method to ascertain the child s desires regarding custody.                                    In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds                              relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing                           the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds                           appropriate.                                    If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has                           attempted to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into                           consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other parent.                                    a    A  Except as provided in Subsection     b , a court may not discriminate                           against a parent due to a disability, as defined in Section                , in awarding custody or                           determining whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award                           of custody.                                 b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining                            whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody,                            the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising                             therefrom  from the disability by showing that                                  i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to                            provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or                                 ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources                            available to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of                            the child at issue.                                 c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to    i   abuse, neglect, or                           dependency proceedings under Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services, or Title   ,                           Chapter  a, Juvenile Court Act of       or  ii   adoption proceedings under Title   , Chapter                              , Adoption.                                     This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint                            legal custody, joint physical custody, or sole custody, but allows the court and the family the                            widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.

The court shall also provide for reasonable parent time with the parent from whose                            custody the child was removed, unless parent time is not in the best interest of the child.  The                            court s order shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether                                  a   placement with the parent continues to be in the child s best interest                                  b   the child should be returned to the original custodial parent                                  c   the child should be placed with a relative, pursuant to Subsection      or                                 d   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                                     The time limitations described in Section         a         with regard to reunification                            efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with                            Subsection    .                                     Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection                                or    .  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition                            that court for modification of the order.                                     a   i   If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of                            his parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at that time,                            determine whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child.                                 ii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a                            reasonable search to determine whether there are relatives of the child who are willing and                            appropriate, in accordance with the requirements of this part and Title   A, Chapter  a, Part  ,                            Child Welfare Services, for placement of the child.  The court shall order the parents to                            cooperate with the division, within five working days, to provide information regarding                            relatives who may be able and willing to care for the child.                                 iii   The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the division pending  that                            the determination under Subsection     a  ii .                                 iv   This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an identified relative will                               receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration  may  shall be given to a                            relative s request for placement of the child, if it is in the best interest of the child, and the                            provisions of this section are satisfied.                                 b   i   If a willing relative is identified pursuant to Subsection     a , the court shall                            make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative to assume custody, and the safety                            and appropriateness of placement with that relative.  In order to be considered a  willing                            relative  under this section, the relative shall be willing to cooperate if the child s permanency                            goal is reunification with his parent or parents, and be willing to adopt or take permanent                            custody of the child if that is determined to be in the best interest of the child.                                 ii   The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to conduct criminal background                            checks described in Sections         a    .      and       A  a    .     , visit the relative s home, check                            the division s management information system for any previous reports of abuse or neglect                            regarding the relative at issue, report its findings in writing to the court, and provide sufficient                            information so that the court may determine whether                                  A   the relative has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other children                            that may indicate or present a danger to this child                                  B   the child is comfortable with the relative                                  C   the relative recognizes the parent s history of abuse and is determined to protect the                            child                                  D   the relative is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent for                            access to the child, in accordance with court orders                                  E   the relative is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary  and                                 F   the relative can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.                                 iii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any                            further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.                                 iv   The division shall complete and file its assessment regarding placement with a                            relative as soon as practicable, in an effort to facilitate placement of the child with a relative.                                 c   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the                            division s investigation pursuant to Subsection     b , and the court s determination regarding                            that placement.  The court shall ultimately base its determination regarding placement with a                            relative on the best interest of the child.                                    d   For purposes of this section,  relative  means an adult who is a grandparent, great                            grandparent, aunt, great aunt, uncle, great uncle, brother in law, sister in law, stepparent, first                            cousin, stepsibling, or sibling of the child.  In the case of a child defined as an  Indian  under                            the Indian Child Welfare Act,    U.S.C. Section     ,  relative  also means an  extended                            family member  as defined by that statute.                                     a   When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative pursuant to                            Subsection    , it shall order that the relative assume custody subject to the continuing                            supervision of the court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided to the minor                            and the relative.  That child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the Division of                            Child and Family Services.  The child and any relative with whom the child is placed are under                            the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may enter any order that it considers                            necessary for the protection and best interest of the child.  The court shall provide for                            reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the child was removed                            unless parent time is not in the best interest of the child.                                 b   i   Placement with a relative pursuant to Subsection     shall be periodically                            reviewed by the court, no less often than every six months, to determine whether                                  A   placement with the relative continues to be in the child s best interest                                  B   the child should be returned home  or                                 C   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                                 ii   No later than    months after placement with a relative the court shall schedule a                            hearing for the purpose of entering a permanent order in accordance with the best interest of the                            child.                                 iii   The time limitations described in Section         a        , with regard to reunification                            efforts, apply to children placed with a relative pursuant to Subsection    .                                     When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of his parent and                            does not vest custody in another parent or relative under this section, the court shall order that                            the child be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, to                            proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services in                            accordance with this chapter and Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.                                     a   Any preferential consideration that a relative  may be  is initially granted                            pursuant to Subsection     expires     days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that                               time period has expired, a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a                            child, may not be granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.                                 b   When the time period described in Subsection     a  has expired, the preferential                            consideration which  may  is initially  be  granted to a natural parent in accordance with                            Subsection    , is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best                            interest of the child.                                Section   .    Section        a         is amended to read                                      a    .  Dispositional hearing    Reunification services    Exceptions.                                     The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section         a        , place                            the child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency,                            order protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or other                            services.                                     a   i  Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing,                            and that the minor remain in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, it shall                            first establish a primary permanency goal for the minor and determine whether, in view of the                            primary permanency goal, reunification services are appropriate for the child and the child s                            family, pursuant to Subsection    .                                 ii   When the court determines that reunification services are appropriate for the child                            and the child s family, the court shall provide for reasonable parent time with the parent or                            parents from whose custody the child was removed, unless parent time is not in the best                            interest of the child.                                 iii   In cases where obvious sexual abuse, abandonment, or serious physical abuse or                            neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                            efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to attempt to                            rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  In all cases, the child s health, safety, and welfare                            shall be the court s paramount concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify                            should be made.                                 b   i   In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a                            concurrent permanency goal.  The concurrent permanency goal shall include a representative                            list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal will be abandoned in favor of                            the concurrent permanency goal and an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying                               the primary permanency goal.                                 ii   A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection                                 a            b  within    days if something other than reunification is initially established as a                            child s primary permanency goal.                                 iii   The court may amend a child s primary permanency goal before the establishment                            of a final permanency plan under Section         a        .  The court is not limited to the terms of                            the concurrent permanency goal in the event that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.                             If, at anytime, the court determines that reunification is no longer a child s primary permanency                            goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section         a                                   within the earlier of    days of the court s determination or    months from the original                            removal of the child.                                 c   i   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order                            that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and the child s parent                            for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time. In                            providing those services, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the division s                            paramount concern, and the court shall so order.                                 ii   The court shall determine whether the services offered or provided by the division                            under the treatment plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division.  The court                            shall also determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the treatment plan in                           accordance with Section       A  a       .  Those duties and responsibilities shall be identified on                            the record, for the purpose of assisting in any future determination regarding the provision of                            reasonable efforts, in accordance with state and federal law.                                 iii   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the date                            that the child was initially removed from the child s home.  Nothing in this section may be                            construed to entitle any parent to an entire    months of reunification services.                                 iv   If reunification services have been ordered, the court may terminate those services                            at any time.                                 v   If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to                            be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection                                 a        , then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance                            with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the                               permanent placement of the child.                                 d   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period                            described in Subsection     c  does not interrupt the running of the period.                                 e   i   If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be                            conducted by the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time                            period for reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than                               months after the original removal of the child.                                 ii   If reunification services have not been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be                            conducted within    days, in accordance with Section         a        .                                 f   With regard to a child who is    months of age or younger at the time the child is                            initially removed from the home, the court shall                                  i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,                            pursuant to Section         a          and                                 ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                            removal of the child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to                            comply with the treatment plan.                                 g   With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have                            been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period                            of six months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate                            reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental                            rights.                                     a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                            permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a                            parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may determine that                            efforts to reunify a child with the child s family are not reasonable or appropriate, based on the                            individual circumstances, and that reunification services should not be provided.  In                            determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a child, and in making  reasonable                            efforts,  the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern.                                 b   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                            parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following                            circumstances exist                                     i   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit                            indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                  ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders him                            incapable of utilizing reunification services  that finding shall be based on competent evidence                            from mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision of services, the                            parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within    months                                  iii   the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or                            sexual abuse, that following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of his                            parent, was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the minor is being removed                            due to additional physical or sexual abuse                                  iv   the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has                            committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder or                            manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide                                  v   the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the                            parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the                            minor                                  vi   the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the                            parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services                            with the offending parent                                  vii   the parent s rights have been terminated with regard to any other child                                  viii   the child has been removed from his home on at least two previous occasions and                            reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times  or                                 ix   the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer  or                                 x   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification                            efforts or services.                                     a   Failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with any                            previous treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the                            influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, whether a parent continues to                            live with an individual who abused the child, any patterns of the parent s behavior that have                            exposed the child to repeated abuse, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent s                            behavior is unlikely to be successful, shall be considered in determining whether reunification                               services are appropriate.                                 b   The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in                            reunification with the child, in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.                                     If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a , and the                            whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the                            minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits                            described in Subsection    , however, are not tolled by the parent s absence.                                     If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable                            services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.  In                            determining detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent child                            bonding, the length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or                            illness, the degree of detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for minors ten years                            of age or older, the minor s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services,                            and any other appropriate factors.  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject                            to the    month limitation imposed in Subsection    .  Reunification services for an                            institutionalized parent are subject to the    month limitation imposed in Subsection    ,                            unless the court determines that continued reunification services would be in the child s best                            interest.                                     If, pursuant to Subsection     b  ii ,  iii ,  iv ,  v ,  vi ,  vii ,  viii ,  ix , or  x , the                            court does not order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within                               days, in accordance with Section         a        .

If a person claims to                             be impecunious, the court shall require of that person an affidavit of impecuniosity as provided                             in Section                 and the court shall follow the procedures and make the determinations as                             provided in Section                .

A difference between the                             minor s wishes and the attorney s determination of best interest may not be considered a                             conflict of interest for the attorney.                                  b   The court may appoint one attorney guardian ad litem to represent the best interests                             of more than one minor child of a marriage.
