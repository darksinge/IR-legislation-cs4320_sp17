If a prospective donor has a declaration or advance health care directive, measuresnecessary to ensure the medical suitability of an organ for transplantation or therapy may not bewithheld or withdrawn from the prospective donor, unless the declaration expressly provides tothe contrary.             .     A medical examiner shall cooperate with procurement organizations to maximizethe opportunity to recover anatomical gifts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research,or education.     If a medical examiner receives notice from a procurement organization that ananatomical gift might be available or was made with respect to a decedent whose body is underthe jurisdiction of the medical examiner and a postmortem examination is going to beperformed, unless the medical examiner denies recovery in accordance with Section                  ,the medical examiner or designee shall conduct a postmortem examination of the body or thepart in a manner and within a period compatible with its preservation for the purposes of thegift.     A part may not be removed from the body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of amedical examiner for transplantation, therapy, research, or education unless the part is thesubject of an anatomical gift.  The body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of the medicalexaminer may not be delivered to a person for research or education unless the body is thesubject of an anatomical gift.  This Subsection     does not preclude a medical examiner fromperforming the medicolegal investigation upon the body or parts of a decedent under thejurisdiction of the medical examiner.             .     Upon request of a procurement organization, a medical examiner shall release tothe procurement organization the name, contact information, and available medical and socialhistory of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner.  If thedecedent s body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education,the medical examiner shall release postmortem examination results to the procurementorganization.  The procurement organization may make a subsequent disclosure of thepostmortem examination results or other information received from the medical examiner onlyif relevant to transplantation or therapy.     The medical examiner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing allmedical records, laboratory test results, x rays, other diagnostic results, and other informationthat any person possesses about a donor or prospective donor whose body is under thejurisdiction of the medical examiner which the medical examiner determines may be relevantto the investigation.     A person that has any information requested by a medical examiner pursuant toSubsection     shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the medicalexaminer to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with thepreservation of parts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.     If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent whose bodyis under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner and a postmortem examination is notrequired, or the medical examiner determines that a postmortem examination is required butthat the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift will not interfere with theexamination, the medical examiner and procurement organization shall cooperate in the timelyremoval of the part from the decedent for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, oreducation.     If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of themedical examiner has been or might be made, but the medical examiner initially believes thatthe recovery of the part could interfere with the postmortem investigation into the decedent scause or manner of death, the medical examiner shall consult with the procurementorganization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about theproposed recovery.  After consultation, the medical examiner may allow the recovery.     Following the consultation under Subsection    , in the absence of mutually agreedupon protocols to resolve conflict between the medical examiner and the procurementorganization, if the medical examiner intends to deny recovery, the medical examiner ordesignee, at the request of the procurement organization, may attend the removal procedure forthe part before making a final determination not to allow the procurement organization torecover the part.  During the removal procedure, the medical examiner or designee may allowrecovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the medical examiner or designeereasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent s cause ormanner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.     If the medical examiner or designee denies recovery under Subsection    , themedical examiner or designee shall  a   explain in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the part  b   include the specific reasons in the records of the medical examiner  and c   provide a record with the specific reasons to the procurement organization.     If the medical examiner or designee allows recovery of a part under Subsection    ,   , or    , the procurement organization, upon request, shall cause the physician or technicianwho removes the part to provide the medical examiner with a record describing the conditionof the part, a biopsy, a photograph, and any other information and observations that wouldassist in the postmortem examination.     If a medical examiner or designee is required to be present at a removal procedureunder Subsection    , upon request the procurement organization requesting the recovery of thepart shall reimburse the medical examiner or designee for the additional costs incurred incomplying with Subsection    .             .In applying and construing this uniform act, consideration must be given to the need topromote uniformity of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it.             .This act modifies, limits, and supersedes the Electronic Signatures in Global andNational Commerce Act,    U.S.C.

A part may not be removed from the body of a decedent under the jurisdiction of a                           medical examiner for transplantation, therapy, research, or education unless the part is the                           subject of an anatomical gift.

Upon request of a procurement organization, a medical examiner shall release to                           the procurement organization the name, contact information, and available medical and social                           history of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner.  If the                           decedent s body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education,                           the medical examiner shall release postmortem examination results to the procurement                           organization.

During the removal procedure, the medical examiner or designee may allow                           recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the medical examiner or designee                           reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent s cause or                           manner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.                                     If the medical examiner or designee denies recovery under Subsection    , the                           medical examiner or designee shall                                  a   explain in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the part                                     b   include the specific reasons in the records of the medical examiner  and                                 c   provide a record with the specific reasons to the procurement organization.

If a medical examiner or designee is required to be present at a removal procedure                           under Subsection    , upon request the procurement organization requesting the recovery of the                           part shall reimburse the medical examiner or designee for the additional costs incurred in                           complying with Subsection    .
