Section   .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Declaration of necessity.              It is declared, as a matter of legislative determination, that it is necessary to grant subpoena          powers in aid of criminal investigations and to provide a method of keeping information gained          from investigations secret both to protect the innocent and to prevent criminal suspects from          having access to information prior to prosecution  and to clarify the power of the attorney general          and county attorneys to grant immunity from prosecution to witnesses whose testimony is essential          to the proper conduct of a criminal investigation or prosecution .              Section   .  Section       b   is enacted to read            CHAPTER   b.  GRANTS OF IMMUNITY                     b  .   Immunity granted to witness of false testimony.                   a   A witness who refuses, or is likely to refuse, on the basis of his privilege against          self incrimination to testify or provide evidence or information in a criminal investigation,                  including a grand jury investigation or prosecution of a criminal case, or in aid of an investigation         or inquiry being conducted by a government agency or commission, or by either house of the         Legislature, a joint committee of the two houses, or a committee or subcommittee of either house         may be compelled to testify or provide evidence or information by any of the following, after         being granted use immunity with regards to the compelled testimony or production of evidence         or information               i   the attorney general or any assistant attorney general authorized by the attorney general               ii   a district attorney or any deputy district attorney authorized by a district attorney               iii   in a county not within a prosecution district, a county attorney or any deputy county          attorney authorized by a county attorney                iv   a special counsel for the grand jury  or               v   a prosecutor pro tempore appointed under the Utah Constitution, Article VIII, Sec.    .               b   If any prosecutor authorized under Subsection     a  intends to compel a witness to          testify or provide evidence or information under a grant of use immunity, the prosecutor shall          notify the witness by written notice.  The notice shall include the information contained in          Subsection     and advise the witness that he may not refuse to testify or provide evidence or          information on the basis of his privilege against self incrimination.  The notice need not be in          writing when the grant of use immunity occurs on the record in the course of a preliminary          hearing, grand jury proceeding, or trial.                   Testimony, evidence, or information compelled under Subsection     may not be used          against the witness in any criminal case, nor any information directly or indirectly derived from          this testimony, evidence, or information, unless the testimony, evidence, or information is          volunteered by the witness or is otherwise not responsive to a question.  Immunity does not extend          to prosecution or punishment for perjury or to giving a false statement in connection with any          testimony.                   If a witness is granted immunity under Subsection    , and is later prosecuted for an          offense that was part of the transaction or events about which the witness was compelled to testify          or produce evidence or information under a grant of immunity, the burden is on the prosecution          to show by a preponderance of the evidence that no use or derivative use was made of the          compelled testimony, evidence, or information in the subsequent case against the witness, and to          show that any proffered evidence was derived from sources totally independent of the compelled                  testimony, evidence, or information.  The remedy for not establishing that any proffered evidence         was derived from sources totally independent of the compelled testimony, evidence, or information         is suppression of that evidence only.                  Nothing in this section prohibits or limits prosecutorial authority granted in Section                . .                  A county attorney within a prosecution district shall have the authority to grant         immunity only as provided in Section        . .             Section   .  Section       b   is enacted to read                    b  .   Refusal of witness to testify or produce evidence or information.                   A witness who has been served with notice under Section      b   and refuses to          comply with the notice may be required to show cause before the district court why the witness          should not be compelled to testify or otherwise produce evidence or information.                   If, after notice and hearing, the court finds that the witness should be compelled to          testify or otherwise produce evidence or information, it shall order the witness to comply.  If the          witness then refuses to comply, the witness may be held in contempt of court.              Section   .  Repealer.              This act repeals               Section    A      , Offenders as witnesses    Privilege.
