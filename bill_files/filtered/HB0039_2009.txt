                    ii   the employer or its insurance carrier submits to the administrative law judge                                  A   a reemployment plan as prepared by a qualified rehabilitation provider reasonably                            designed to return the employee to gainful employment  or                                 B   notice that the employer or its insurance carrier will not submit a plan  and                                    iii   the administrative law judge, after notice to the parties, holds a hearing, unless                            otherwise stipulated, to                                  A   consider evidence regarding rehabilitation  and                                 B   review any reemployment plan submitted by the employer or its

                  law judge shall order                                  i   the initiation of permanent total disability compensation payments to provide for the                            employee s subsistence  and                                 ii   the payment of any undisputed disability or medical benefits due the employee.                                 c   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , an order for payment of benefits described in                            Subsection     b  is considered a final order for purposes of Section       A          .                                 d   The employer or its insurance carrier shall be given credit for any disability                            payments made under Subsection     b  against its ultimate disability compensation liability                            under this chapter or Chapter  , Utah Occupational Disease Act.                                 e   An employer or its insurance carrier may not be ordered to submit a reemployment                            plan.  If the employer or its insurance carrier voluntarily submits a plan, the plan is subject to                            Subsections     e  i  through  iii .                                 i   The plan may include, but not require an employee to pay for                                  A   retraining                                  B   education                                  C   medical and disability compensation benefits                                  D   job placement services  or                                 E   incentives calculated to facilitate reemployment.                                 ii   The plan shall include payment of reasonable disability compensation to provide                            for the employee s subsistence during the rehabilitation process.                                 iii   The employer or its insurance carrier shall diligently pursue the reemployment                            plan.  The employer s or insurance carrier s failure to diligently pursue the reemployment plan                            is cause for the administrative law judge on the administrative law judge s own motion to make                            a final decision of permanent total disability.                                 f   If a preponderance of the evidence shows that successful rehabilitation is not                               possible, the administrative law judge shall order that the employee be paid weekly permanent                            total disability compensation benefits.                                 g   If a preponderance of the evidence shows that pursuant to a reemployment plan, as                            prepared by a qualified rehabilitation provider and presented under Subsection     e , an                            employee could immediately or without unreasonable delay return to work but for the                            following, an administrative law judge shall order that the employee be denied the payment of                            weekly permanent total disability compensation benefits                                  i   incarceration in a facility operated by or contracting with a federal, state, county, or                            municipal government to house a criminal offender in either a secure or nonsecure setting  or                                 ii   not being legally eligible to be employed because of a reason unrelated to the                            impairment or combination of impairments.                                     a   The period of benefits commences on the date the employee became                            permanently totally disabled, as determined by a final order of the commission based on the                            facts and evidence, and ends                                  i   with the death of the employee  or                                 ii   when the employee is capable of returning to regular, steady work.                                 b   An employer or its insurance carrier may provide or locate for a permanently totally                            disabled employee reasonable, medically appropriate, part time work in a job earning at least                            minimum wage, except that the employee may not be required to accept the work to the extent                            that it would disqualify the employee from Social Security disability benefits.                                 c   An employee shall                                  i   fully cooperate in the placement and employment process  and                                 ii   accept the reasonable, medically appropriate, part time work.                                 d   In a consecutive four week period when an employee s gross income from the work                            provided under Subsection     b  exceeds     , the employer or insurance carrier may reduce                            the employee s permanent total disability compensation by     of the employee s income in                            excess of     .                                 e   If a work opportunity is not provided by the employer or its insurance carrier, a                            permanently totally disabled employee may obtain medically appropriate, part time work                            subject to the offset provisions of Subsection     d .                                 f   i   The commission shall establish rules regarding the part time work and offset.                                    ii   The adjudication of disputes arising under this Subsection     is governed by Part                             , Adjudication.                                 g   The employer or its insurance carrier has the burden of proof to show that                            medically appropriate part time work is available.                                 h   The administrative law judge may                                  i   excuse an employee from participation in any work                                  A   that would require the employee to undertake work exceeding the employee s                                  I   medical capacity  or                                 II   residual functional capacity  or                                 B   for good cause  or                                 ii   allow the employer or its insurance carrier to reduce permanent total disability                            benefits as provided in Subsection     d  when reasonable, medically appropriate, part time                            work is offered, but the employee fails to fully cooperate.                                     When an employee is rehabilitated or the employee s rehabilitation is possible but                            the employee has some loss of bodily function, the award shall be for permanent partial                            disability.
