The provisions of this section are subject to the prohibition under Section                . .

If the board finds that approval of additional radioactive waste license applications,        renewals, or amendments will result in inadequate oversight, monitoring, or licensure        compliance and enforcement of existing and any additional radioactive waste facilities, the board        shall suspend acceptance of further applications for radioactive waste licenses.  The board shall        report the suspension to the Legislative Management Committee.
