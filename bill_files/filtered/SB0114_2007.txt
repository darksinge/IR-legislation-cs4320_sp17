Except                              as provided in Subsection             .        , in all proceedings before a jury, under this section, it                           shall be instructed as to the punishment to be imposed upon a unanimous decision for death                           and that the penalty of either an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which                           may be for life or life in prison without parole, shall be imposed if a unanimous decision for                           death is not found.                                b   The death penalty shall only be imposed if, after considering the totality of the                           aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the jury is persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that                           total aggravation outweighs total mitigation, and is further persuaded, beyond a reasonable                           doubt, that the imposition of the death penalty is justified and appropriate in the circumstances.                            If the jury reports unanimous agreement to impose the sentence of death, the court shall                           discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of death.                                c   If the jury is unable to reach a unanimous decision imposing the sentence of death                            or the state is not seeking the death penalty , the jury shall then determine whether the penalty                           of life in prison without parole shall be imposed, except as provided in Subsection                                     .        .  The penalty of life in prison without parole shall only be imposed if the jury                            determines that the sentence of life in prison without parole is appropriate.  If the jury reports                            agreement by ten jurors or more to impose the sentence of life in prison without parole, the                            court shall discharge the jury and shall impose the sentence of life in prison without parole.  If                            ten jurors or more do not agree upon a sentence of life in prison without parole, the court shall                            discharge the jury and impose an indeterminate prison term of not less than    years and which                            may be for life.                                 d   If the defendant waives hearing before the jury as to sentencing, with the approval                            of the court and the consent of the prosecution, the court shall determine the appropriate                            penalty according to the standards of Subsections     b  and  c .                                 e   If the defendant is sentenced to more than one term of life in prison with or without                            the possibility of parole, or in addition to a sentence of life in prison with or without the                            possibility of parole the defendant is sentenced for other offenses which result in terms of                            imprisonment, the judge shall determine whether the terms of imprisonment shall be imposed                               as concurrent or consecutive sentences in accordance with Section                 .                                     Upon any appeal by the defendant where the sentence is of death, the appellate                            court, if it finds prejudicial error in the sentencing proceeding only, may set aside the sentence                            of death and remand the case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings to the extent                            necessary to correct the error or errors.  An error in the sentencing proceedings may not result                            in the reversal of the conviction of a capital felony.  In cases of remand for new sentencing                            proceedings, all exhibits and a transcript of all testimony and other evidence properly admitted                            in the prior trial and sentencing proceedings are admissible in the new sentencing proceedings,                            and if the sentencing proceeding was before a                                  a   jury, a new jury shall be impaneled for the new sentencing proceeding unless the                            defendant waives the hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of                            the prosecution, in which case the proceeding shall be held according to Subsection     b  or                             c , as applicable                                  b   judge, the original trial judge shall conduct the new sentencing proceeding  or                                 c   judge, and the original trial judge is unable or unavailable to conduct a new                            sentencing proceeding, then another judge shall be designated to conduct the new sentencing                            proceeding, and the new proceeding will be before a jury unless the defendant waives the                            hearing before the jury with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecution.
