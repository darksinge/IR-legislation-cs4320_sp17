A health care facility licensed under this chapter which reports disciplinary information on          a licensed nurse to the Division of Occupations and Professions within the Department of          Commerce as required by Section      b     is entitled to the immunity from liability provided          by that section.              Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Emergency care rendered by licensee.

Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Qualified immunity    Health professionals    Charity care.                     a   The Legislature finds many residents of this state do not receive medical care and                 preventive health care because they lack health insurance or because of financial difficulties or         cost.  The Legislature also finds that many physicians, charity health care facilities, and other         health care  professionals in this state would be willing to volunteer medical and allied services         without compensation if they were not subject to the high exposure of liability connected with         providing these services.              b   The Legislature therefore declares that its intention in enacting this section is to         encourage the provision of uncompensated volunteer health care in charity care settings in         exchange for a limitation on liability for the health care facilities and health care professionals who         provide those volunteer services.                   As used in this section                a    Health care facility  means any clinic or hospital, church, or organization whose          primary purpose is to sponsor, promote, or organize uncompensated health care services for people          unable to pay for health care services.               b    Health care professional  means individuals licensed under Title   , Occupations and          Professions, as physicians and surgeons, osteopaths, podiatrists, chiropractors, dentists, dental          hygienists, registered nurses, certified nurse midwives, and other  nurses  in license classifications           licensed under  Subsection             Section      b    .               c    Remuneration or compensation                 i   A   means direct or indirect receipt of any payment by the physician and surgeon,          health care facility, other health care professional, or organization, on behalf of the patient,          including payment or reimbursement under medicare or medicaid, or under the state program for          the medically indigent on behalf of the patient  and               B   compensation, salary, or reimbursement to the health care professional from any          source for the health care professional s services or time in volunteering to provide uncompensated          health care  and               ii   does not mean any grant or donation to the health care facility used to offset direct          costs associated with providing the uncompensated health care such as medical supplies or drugs.                   A health care professional who provides health care treatment at a health care facility          is not liable in a medical malpractice action if                a   the treatment was within the scope of the health care professional s license under this          title                       b   neither the health care professional nor the health care facility received compensation         or remuneration for the treatment               c   the acts or omissions of the health care professional were not grossly negligent or         willful and wanton  and              d   prior to rendering services, the health care professional disclosed in writing to the         patient, or if a minor, to the patient s parent or legal guardian, that the health care professional is         providing the services without receiving remuneration or compensation and that in exchange for         receiving uncompensated health care, the patient consents to waive any right to sue for         professional negligence except for acts or omissions which are grossly negligent or are willful and          wanton.                   A health care facility which sponsors, promotes, or organizes the uncompensated care           is not liable in a medical malpractice action for acts and omissions if                a   the health care facility meets the requirements in Subsection     b                 b   the acts and omissions of the health care facility were not grossly negligent or willful          and wanton  and               c   the health care facility has posted, in a conspicuous place, a notice that in accordance          with this section the health care facility is not liable for any civil damages for acts or omissions          except for those acts or omissions that are grossly negligent or are willful and wanton.                   Immunity from liability under this section does not extend to the use of general          anesthesia or care that requires an overnight stay in a general acute or specialty hospital licensed          under Title   , Chapter   , Health Care Facility  Licensure  Licensing and Inspection Act.
