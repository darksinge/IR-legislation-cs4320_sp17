If a prepayment does not pay the full amount owed on the high cost mortgage when                           the prepayment is made, the penalty shall be reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of                           the balance owed before the prepayment that remains unpaid.

Section  .    Section        d         is enacted to read                                     d    .  Balloon payments    Prohibited.                                     A high cost mortgage having a term of less than five years may not include terms                           under which the aggregate amount of the regular periodic payments would not fully amortize                           the outstanding principal.                                     A high cost mortgage may not require a scheduled payment that is more than twice                           as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments.                                     This section does not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to account for                           the seasonal or irregular income of the obligor as provided in the high cost mortgage trust deed                           or if the purpose of the loan is a bridge loan made in connection with the acquisition or                              construction of a dwelling intended to become the obligor s principal dwelling.

A high cost mortgage may not include terms under which the outstanding principal                           balance will increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regular periodic                           payments do not cover the full amount of the interest due.                                Section  .    Section        d         is enacted to read                                     d    .  Financing points and fees    Restrictions.                                     A lender may not, in connection with the formation or consummation of a high cost                           mortgage, finance, directly or indirectly, any portion of the points, fees, or other charges                           payable to the lender or any third party in an amount in excess of    of the total loan amount,                           unless the following additional disclosures are made to the borrower in conspicuous type size                                  a    You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received                           these disclosures or have signed the loan application.                                  b    If you obtain this loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your home.  You could                           lose your home or property, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet your                           obligations under this loan.                                  c    The timing and amount of payments on debts you already are carrying contribute                           to the credit rating that is used to determine whether you may get a new loan and how much                           you will pay for that new loan.  You should not accept any advice to ignore or delay making                           any payment on loans you already have, even if those loans will be paid off with the new loan.                                  d    You may get into serious financial difficulties if you use this loan to pay off old                           debts and then run up other new debts.
