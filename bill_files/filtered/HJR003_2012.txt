Resolution of Congress, October   ,                                       WHEREAS, the territorial and public lands of the United States are dealt with in                           Article IV, section  , clause   of the United States Constitution, referred to as the Property                           Clause, which states,  The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules                           and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.                                 WHEREAS, with this clause, the Constitutional Convention agreed that the                           Constitution would maintain the  statu quo  that had been established with respect to the                           federal territorial lands being disposed of only to create new states with the same rights of                           sovereignty, freedom, and independence as the original states                                WHEREAS, under these express terms of trust, the land claiming states, over time,                              ceded their western land to their confederated Union and retained their claims that the                           confederated government dispose of such lands only to create new states  and for no other use                           or purpose whatsoever  and apply the net proceeds of any sales of such lands only for the                           purpose of paying down the public debt                                WHEREAS, with respect to the disposition of the federal territorial lands, the                           Northwest Ordinance of July   ,     , provides,  The legislatures of those districts or new                           States, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in                           Congress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary for securing the                           title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers                                 WHEREAS, by resolution in     , the United States Congress declared  That the                           proceeds of sales which shall be made of lands in the Western territory, now belonging or that                           may hereafter belong to the United States, shall be, and are hereby appropriated towards                           sinking or discharging the debts for the payment whereof the United States now are, or by                           virtue of this act may be holden, and shall be applied solely to that use, until the said debt shall                           be fully satisfied                                 WHEREAS, the intent of the founding fathers to eventually extinguish title to all public                           lands was reaffirmed by President Andrew Jackson in a message to the United States Senate on                           December  ,     , where he explained the reasons he vetoed a bill entitled  An act to                           appropriate for a limited time the proceeds of the sales of the public lands of the United States                           and for granting lands to certain States    I do not doubt that it is the real interest of each and                           all the States in the Union, and particularly of the new States, that the price of these lands shall                           be reduced and graduated, and that after they have been offered for a certain number of years                           the refuse remaining unsold shall be abandoned to the States and the machinery of our land                           system entirely withdrawn.  It can not be supposed the compacts intended that the United States                           should retain forever a title to lands within the States which are of no value, and no doubt is                           entertained that the general interest would be best promoted by surrendering such lands to the                           States                                 WHEREAS, in     , United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, in                           American Ins. Co. v.     Bales of Cotton,    U.S.           , confirmed that no provision in                           the Constitution authorized the federal government to indefinitely exercise control over western                           public lands beyond the duty to manage these lands pending the disposal of the lands to create                              new states when he said,  At the time the Constitution was formed, the limits of the territory                           over which it was to operate were generally defined and recognised  sic .  These limits                           consisted in part, of organized states, and in part of territories, the absolute property and                           dependencies of the United States.  These states, this territory, and future states to be admitted                           into the Union, are the sole objects of the Constitution  there is no express provision whatever                           made in the Constitution for the acquisition or government of territories beyond those Limits.                                 WHEREAS, in     , referring to these land cession compacts which arose from the                           original      congressional resolution, President Andrew Jackson stated,  These solemn                           compacts, invited by Congress in a resolution declaring the purposes to which the proceeds of                           these lands should be applied, originating before the constitution, and forming the basis on                            which it was made, bound the United States to a particular course of policy in relation to them                            by ties as strong as can be invented to secure the faith of nations   Land bill veto, December  ,                                                                  WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court, in State of Texas v. White,    U.S.                                      , clarified that a state, by definition, includes a defined sovereign territory, stating that                             State , in the constitutional context, is  a political community of free citizens, occupying a                            territory of defined boundaries, and organized under a government sanctioned and limited by a                            written constitution, and established by the consent of the governed , and added,  This is                            undoubtedly the fundamental idea upon which the republican institutions of our own country                            are established                                  WHEREAS, in Shively v. Bowlby,     U.S.         , the United States Supreme Court                            confirmed that all federal territories, regardless of how acquired, are held in trust to create new                            states on an equal footing with the original states when it stated,  Upon the acquisition of a                            Territory by the United States, whether by cession from one of the States, or by treaty with a                            foreign country, or by discovery and settlement, the same title and dominion passed to the                            United States, for the benefit of the whole people, and in trust for the several States to be                            ultimately created out of the Territory.                                  WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that the federal government                            must honor its trust obligation to extinguish title to the public lands for the sovereignty of the                            new state to be complete, stating once  the United States shall have fully executed these trusts,                            the municipal sovereignty of the new states will be complete, throughout their respective                               borders, and they, and the original states, will be upon an equal footing, in all respects. . .

such states were admitted into the union, and contained the same                            promise to all new states that the federal government would extinguish title to all public lands                            lying within their respective borders                                 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court looks upon the enabling acts which                            create new states as  solemn compacts  and  bilateral  two way  agreements  to be performed                             in a timely fashion                                  WHEREAS, under Section   of Utah s Enabling Act, Utah agreed to the same solemn                            compacts as states preceding in statehood, that until the title to unappropriated public lands                            lying within the state s boundaries  shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same                            shall be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and said Indian lands shall                            remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States  .  .  .                             that no taxes shall be imposed by the State on lands or property therein belonging to or which                            may hereafter be purchased by the United States or reserved for its use                                  WHEREAS, the trust obligation of the federal government to timely extinguish title of                            all public lands lying within the boundaries of the state of Utah is made even more clear in                            Section   of Utah s Enabling Act as follows   That five per centum of the proceeds of the sales                            of public lands lying within said State, which shall be sold by the United States subsequent to                            the admission of said State into the Union, after deducting all the expenses incident to the                            same, shall be paid to the said State, to be used as a Permanent Fund, the interest of which only                            shall be expended for the support of the common schools within said State

the state of Utah by and through the                                 Taylor Grazing Act which declared that the act was established  In order to promote the                            highest use of the public lands pending its final disposal                                  WHEREAS, in     , after nearly     years of trust history regarding the obligation of                            Congress to extinguish title of western lands to create new states and use the proceeds to                            discharge its public debts, the United States Congress purported to unilaterally change this                            solemn promise by and through the Federal Land Policy Management Act  FLPMA , which                               provides, in part,  The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that the                            public lands be retained in Federal ownership, unless . . .  it is determined that disposal of a                            particular parcel will serve the federal interest                                  WHEREAS, at the time of Utah s Enabling Act the course and practice of the United                            States

title to all                            lands within its defined boundaries within a reasonable time such that the state of Utah and its                            Permanent Fund for its Common Schools could never realize the bargained for benefit of the                            deployment, taxation, or economic benefit of all the lands within its defined boundaries                                 WHEREAS, from      forward the federal government only held bare legal title to the                            western public lands in the nature of a trustee in trust with the solemn

      eastern edge of the state of Colorado and also with the state of Hawaii                                 WHEREAS, by the terms of Utah s Enabling Act, Utah suspended its sovereign right to

persistently failed to honor its                            promises and has refused to abide by the terms of its preexisting solemn obligations to                            imminently extinguish title to all public lands                                 WHEREAS, had Congress honored its promise to Utah to timely extinguish title to all                            public lands within Utah s

its duty in      to                            extinguish title to all public lands within Utah s borders by committing to a policy of retention                            and a process of comprehensive land management and planning coordinated between the                            federal government, the states, and local governing bodies for access, multiple use, and                               sustained yield of the public lands                                 WHEREAS, despite the fact that the federal government had not divested all public                            lands within Utah s borders by     , this did not alleviate the federal government from its duty                            to extinguish title and divest itself of federal ownership of remaining public land in Utah by                            ceding such land directly to the state as it did with other states                                 WHEREAS, since the passage of FLPMA, the federal government has engaged in a                            persistent pattern and course of conduct in direct violation of the letter and spirit of FLPMA                            through an abject disregard of local resource management plans, failure and refusal to                            coordinate and cooperate with the state and local governments, unilateral and oppressive land                            control edicts to the severe and extreme detriment of the state and its ability to adequately fund                            education, provide essential government services, secure economic opportunities for wage                            earners and Utah business, and ensure a stable prosperous future                                 WHEREAS, under the United State Constitution, the American states reorganized to                            form a more perfect union, yielding up certain portions of their sovereign powers to the elected                            officers of the government of their union, yet retaining the residuum of sovereignty for the                            purpose of independent internal self governance                                 WHEREAS, by compact between the original states, territorial lands were divided into                             suitable extents of territory  and upon attaining a certain population, were to be admitted into                            the union upon  an equal footing  as members possessing  the same rights of sovereignty,                            freedom and independence  as the original states                                 WHEREAS, the federal trust respecting public lands obligates the United States,                            through their agent, Congress, to extinguish both their government jurisdiction and their title                            on the public lands that are held in trust by the United States for the states in which they are                            located                                 WHEREAS, the state and federal partnership of public lands management has been                            eroded by an oppressive and over reaching federal management agenda that has adversely                            impacted the sovereignty and the economies of the state of Utah and local governments                                 WHEREAS, federal land management actions, even when applied exclusively to                            federal lands, directly impact the ability of the state of Utah to manage its school trust lands in                            accordance with the mandate of the Utah Enabling Act and to meet its obligation to the                            beneficiaries of the trust                                    WHEREAS, Utah has been substantially damaged in its ability to provide funding for                            education and the common good of the state and to serve a sustainable, vibrant economy into                            the future because the federal government has unduly retained control of nearly two thirds of                            the lands lying within Utah s borders                                 WHEREAS, Utah consistently ranks highest among all the states in class size and                            lowest in the nation in per pupil spending for education                                 WHEREAS, had the federal government disposed of the land in or about     , Utah                            would have, from that point forward, generated substantial tax revenues and revenues from the                            sustainable managed use of its natural resources to the benefit of its public schools and to the                            common good of the state and nation                                 WHEREAS, the federal government gives Utah less than half of the net proceeds of                            mineral lease revenues and severance taxes generated from the lands within Utah s borders                                 WHEREAS, Utah has been substantially damaged in mineral lease revenues and                            severance taxes in that, had the federal government extinguished title to all public lands, Utah                            would realize      of the mineral lease revenues and severance taxes from the lands                                 WHEREAS, the Bureau of Land Management s  BLM  failure to act affirmatively on                            definitive allocation decisions of multiple use activities in resource management plans has                            created uncertainty in the future of public land use in Utah and has caused capital to flee the                            state                                 WHEREAS, during the process of finalizing the most recent six Resource Management                            Plans, the BLM refused to consider state and local government acknowledgments of R.S.                                 rights of way or other evidence of the existence of R.S.      rights of way in the Grand                            Staircase Escalante National Monument                                 WHEREAS, the BLM has demonstrated a chronic inability to handle the proliferation                            of wild horses and burros on the public lands, to the detriment of the rangeland resource                                 WHEREAS, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to extend its                            jurisdiction to regulate the waters of the United States to areas traditionally dry, except during                            severe weather events, in violation of the common definition of jurisdictional waters                                 WHEREAS, in      the president of the United States abused the intent of the                            Antiquities Act by the creation of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument without                            any consultation with the state and local authorities or citizens                                    WHEREAS, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is making decisions                            concerning various species on BLM lands under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act                            without serious consideration of state wildlife management activities and protection designed                            to prevent the need for a listing, or recognizing the ability to delist a species, thereby affecting                            the economic vitality of the state and local region                                 WHEREAS, the BLM has not authorized all necessary rangeland improvement projects                            involving the removal of pinyon juniper and other climax vegetation, thereby reducing the                            biological diversity of the range, reducing riparian viability and water quality, and reducing the                            availability of forage for both livestock and wildlife                                 WHEREAS, Utah initially supported placing into reserve the six National Forests in                            Utah    Ashley, Fishlake, Manti La Sal, Dixie, Uinta, and Wasatch Cache, because Utah was                            promised this action would preserve the forest lands as watersheds and for agricultural use                               namely timber and other wood products, and grazing                                 WHEREAS, this vision and promise of agricultural production on the forest lands is the                            reason that the United States Forest Service was made part of the United States Department of                            Agriculture as opposed to the Department of the Interior                                 WHEREAS, the promise of preservation for agricultural use has been broken by the                            current and recent administrations                                 WHEREAS, logging, timber, and wood products operations on Utah s National Forests                            have come to a virtual standstill, resulting in forests that are choked with old growth                            monocultures, loss of aspen diversity, loss of habitat, and a threat to community watersheds                            due to insect infestation and catastrophic fire                                 WHEREAS, these conditions are the result of a failure to properly manage the forest                            lands for their intended use, which is responsible and sustained timber production, watersheds                            and grazing                                 WHEREAS, the only remedy for federal government breaches of Utah s Enabling Act                            Compact and breaches to the spirit and letter of the promises of FLPMA is for the state of Utah                            to take back title and management responsibility of federally managed public lands, which                            would restore the promises in the solemn compact made at statehood                                 WHEREAS, under Article I, Section  , Clause    of the United States Constitution, the                            federal government is only constitutionally authorized to exercise jurisdiction over and above                               bare right and title over lands that are  purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State                            in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock Yards, and                            other needful Buildings                                  WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court affirmed that the federal government                            only holds lands as a mere  ordinary proprietor  and cannot exert jurisdictional dominion and                            control over public lands without the consent of the state Legislature, stating  Where lands are                            acquired without such consent, the possession of the United States, unless political jurisdiction                            be ceded to them in some other way, is simply that of an ordinary proprietor  emphasis added .                             The property in that case, unless used as a means to carry out the purposes of the government,                            is subject to the legislative authority and control of the states equally with the property of                            private individuals.

Office of Hawaiian Affairs,     U.S.           , affirmed that Congress has no right                            to change the promises it made to a state s Enabling Act, stating,  .  .  .   a subsequent act of                            Congress  would raise grave constitutional concerns if it purported to  cloud  Hawaii s title to                            its sovereign lands more than three decades after the State s admission to the Union .  .  .                               T he consequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ignores the uniquely sovereign                           character of that event . . . to suggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish what has                           already been bestowed .  And that proposition applies a fortiori  with even greater force                            where virtually all of the State s public lands .  .  . are at stake   emphasis added, citation                            omitted                                  WHEREAS, citizens of the state of Utah have a love of the land and have demonstrated                            responsible stewardship of lands within state jurisdiction                                 WHEREAS, the state of Utah is willing to sponsor, evaluate, and advance the locally                            driven efforts in a more efficient manner than the federal government, to the benefit of all                            users, including recreation, conservation, and the responsible and sustainable management of                            Utah s natural resources                                 WHEREAS, the state of Utah has a proven regulatory structure to manage public lands                            for multiple use and sustainable yield                                 WHEREAS, the United States Congress disposed of lands within the boundaries of the                            states of Tennessee and Hawaii directly to those states                                    WHEREAS, because of the entanglements and rights arising over the     years that the                            federal government has failed to honor its promise to timely extinguish title to public lands and                            because of the federal government s breach of Utah s Enabling Act and breach of FLPMA,                            among other promises made, and the damages resulting from such breaches, the United States                            Congress should imminently transfer title to all public lands lying within the State of Utah                            directly to the State of Utah, as it did with Hawaii and Tennessee                                 WHEREAS, the Legislature of the state of Utah, upon transfer of title by the federal                            government of the public lands directly to the state, intends to cede the national park land to the                            federal government on condition that the lands permanently remain national park lands, that                            they not be sold, transferred, left in disrepair, or conveyed to any party other than the state of                            Utah                                 WHEREAS, the Legislature of the state of Utah, upon transfer of title by the federal                            government of the public lands directly to the state, intends to cede to the federal government                            all lands currently designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System pursuant                            to the Wilderness Act of                                      WHEREAS, in order to effectively address the accumulated entanglements and                            expectations over Utah s public lands, including open space, access, multiple use, and the                            management of sustainable yields of Utah s natural resources, a Utah Public Lands                            Commission should be formed to review and manage multiple use of the public lands and to                            determine, through a public process, the extent to which public land may be sold, if any  and                                WHEREAS, to the extent that the Public Lands Commission determines through a                            public process that any such land should be sold to private owners, that    of the net proceeds                            should be paid to the Permanent Fund for Utah s public schools, and     of the net proceeds                            should be paid to the federal government to pay down the federal debt                                 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah                            demands that the federal government imminently transfer title to all of the public lands within                            Utah s borders directly to the state of Utah.
