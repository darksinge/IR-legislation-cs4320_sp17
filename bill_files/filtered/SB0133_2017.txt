Criteria not described in the request for proposals may not be used to evaluate a       proposal.                 a   For a procurement of administrative law judge service, an evaluation committee       shall consist of              i   the head of the conducting procurement unit, or the head s designee              ii   the head of an executive branch procurement unit other than the conducting       procurement unit, appointed by the executive director of the Department of Human Resource       Management, or the head s designee  and             iii   the executive director of the Department of Human Resource Management, or the       executive director s designee.             b   For every other procurement requiring an evaluation by an evaluation committee,       the conducting procurement unit shall              i   appoint an evaluation committee consisting of at least three individuals with at least       a general familiarity with or basic understanding of              A   the technical requirements relating to the type of procurement item that is the       subject of the procurement  or              B   the need that the procurement item is intended to address  and              ii   ensure that the evaluation committee and each individual participating in the        evaluation committee process               A   does not have a conflict of interest with any of the offerors               B   can fairly evaluate each proposal               C   does not contact or communicate with an offeror concerning the procurement        outside the official evaluation committee process  and              D   conducts or participates in the evaluation in a manner that ensures a fair and        competitive process and avoids the appearance of impropriety.                  A conducting procurement unit may authorize an evaluation committee to receive        assistance               a   from an expert or consultant who               i   is not a member of the evaluation committee  and              ii   does not participate in the evaluation scoring  and              b   to better understand a technical issue involved in the procurement.                  a   An

original proposal               B   correct a deficiency, inaccuracy, or mistake in a proposal that is not an immaterial        error               C   correct an incomplete submission of documents that the solicitation required to be        submitted with the proposal               D   correct a failure to submit a timely proposal               E   substitute or alter a required form or other document specified in the solicitation               F   remedy a cause for an offeror being considered to be not responsible or a proposal        not responsive  or              G   correct a defect or inadequacy resulting in a determination that an offeror does not        meet the mandatory minimum requirements, evaluation criteria, or applicable score thresholds        established in the solicitation.                  a   Except as provided in Subsection     b  relating to access to management fee        information, and except as provided in Subsection    , each member of the

submits its        final recommended scores on all other criteria to the issuing procurement unit.              b   The issuing procurement unit shall               i   if applicable, assign an individual who is not a member of the evaluation committee        to calculate scores for cost based on the applicable scoring formula, weighting, and other        scoring procedures contained in the request for proposals               ii   review the evaluation committee s scores and correct any errors, scoring        inconsistencies, and reported noncompliance with this chapter               iii   add the scores calculated for cost, if applicable, to the evaluation committee s final        recommended scores on criteria other than cost to derive the total combined score for each        responsive and responsible proposal  and              iv   provide to the evaluation committee the total combined score calculated for each        responsive and responsible proposal, including any applicable cost formula, weighting, and        scoring procedures used to calculate the total combined scores.              c   The evaluation committee may not               i   change its final recommended scores described in Subsection     a  after the        evaluation committee has submitted those scores to the issuing procurement unit  or              ii   change cost scores calculated by the issuing procurement unit.                  a   As used in this Subsection    ,  management fee  includes only the following        fees of the construction manager general contractor

When selecting a construction manager general contractor for a construction        project, the evaluation committee               i   may score a construction manager general contractor based upon criteria contained        in the solicitation, including qualifications, performance ratings, references, management plan,        certifications, and other project specific criteria described in the solicitation               ii   may, as described in the solicitation, weight and score the management fee as a        fixed rate or as a fixed percentage of the estimated contract value               iii   may, at any time after the opening of the responses to the request for proposals,        have access to, and consider, the management fee proposed by the offerors  and              iv   except as provided in Subsection    , may not know or have access to any other        information relating to the cost of construction submitted by the offerors, until after the        evaluation committee submits its final recommended scores on all other criteria to the issuing        procurement unit.                  a   The deliberations of an evaluation committee may be held in private.              b   If the evaluation committee is a public body, as defined in Section         , the        evaluation committee shall comply with Section          in closing a meeting for its        deliberations.                  An issuing procurement unit is not required to comply with Subsection     or            b  iv , as applicable, if the head of the issuing procurement unit or a person designated by        rule made by the applicable rulemaking authority               a   signs a written statement               i   indicating that, due to the nature of the proposal or other circumstances, it is in the        best interest of the procurement unit to waive compliance with Subsection     or     b  iv , as        the case may be  and              ii   describing the nature of the proposal and the other circumstances relied upon to        waive compliance with Subsection     or     b  iv   and              b   makes the written statement available to the public, upon request.
