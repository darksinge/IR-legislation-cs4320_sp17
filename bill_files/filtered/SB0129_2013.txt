A garnishee may deduct from the property any liquidated claim against the                           defendant.                                      a   If a debt to the garnishee is secured by property, the office                                  i   is not required to apply the property to the debt when the office issues the                              administrative garnishment order  and                                 ii   may obtain a court order authorizing the office to buy the debt and requiring the                           garnishee to deliver the property.                                 b   Notwithstanding Subsection      a  i                                   i   the administrative garnishment order remains in effect  and                                 ii   the office may apply the property to the debt.                                 c   The office or a third party may perform an obligation of the defendant and require                           the garnishee to deliver the property upon completion of performance or, if performance is                           refused, upon tender of performance if                                  i   the obligation is secured by property  and                                 ii   A   the obligation does not require the personal performance of the defendant  and                                 B   a third party may perform the obligation.                                      a   The office may issue a continuing garnishment order against a nonexempt                           periodic payment.                                 b   This section is subject to the Utah Exemptions Act.                                 c   A continuing garnishment order issued in accordance with this section applies to                           payments to the defendant from the date of service upon the garnishee until the earlier of the                           following                                  i   the last periodic payment                                  ii   the judgment upon which the administrative garnishment order is issued is stayed,                           vacated, or satisfied in full  or                                 iii   the office releases the order.                                 d   No later than seven days after the last day of each payment period, the garnishee                           shall with respect to that period                                  i   answer each interrogatory                                  ii   serve an answer to each interrogatory on the office, the defendant, and any other                           person who has a recorded interest in the property  and                                 iii   deliver the property to the office.                                    e   If the office issues a continuing garnishment order during the term of a writ of                           continuing garnishment issued by the district court, the order issued by the office                                  i   is tolled when a writ of garnishment or other income withholding is already in effect                           and is withholding greater than or equal to the maximum portion of disposable earnings                           described in Subsection                                       ii   is collected in the amount of the difference between the maximum portion of                           disposable earnings described in Subsection      and the amount being garnished by an                           existing writ of continuing garnishment if the maximum portion of disposable earnings exceed                           the existing writ of garnishment or other income withholding  and                                 iii   shall take priority upon the termination of the current term of existing writs.                                      The maximum portion of disposable earnings of an individual subject to seizure in                           accordance with this section is the lesser of                                  a       of the defendant s disposable earnings for any other judgment  or                                 b   the amount by which the defendant s disposable earnings for a pay period exceeds                           the number of weeks in that pay period multiplied by    times the federal minimum wage as                           provided in    U.S.C.
