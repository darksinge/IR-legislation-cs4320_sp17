A  a    .     Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest isdetermined by the facts of each case.     A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the considerationthat the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is anobligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and  a   the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic lifeof the goods  b   the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goodsor is bound to become the owner of the goods  c   the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of thegoods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliancewith the lease agreement  or d   the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additionalconsideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the leaseagreement.     A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merelybecause  a   the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for theright to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fairmarket value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into  b   the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods  c   the lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing,recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs  d   the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods  e   the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greaterthan the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of therenewal at the time the option is to be performed  or f   the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that isequal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time theoption is to be performed.     Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee s reasonablypredictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if  a   when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to bethe fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the timethe option is to be performed  or b   when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the priceis stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to beperformed.     The  remaining economic life of the goods  and  reasonably predictable  fairmarket rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must bedetermined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is enteredinto.      A  a    .Except as otherwise provided in Chapters  , Uniform Commercial Code   NegotiableInstruments,  , Uniform Commercial Code   Bank Deposits and Collections, and  , UniformCommercial Code   Letters of Credit, a person gives value for rights if the person acquiresthem      in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension ofimmediately available credit, whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge back isprovided for in the event of difficulties in collection      as security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim      by accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase  or     in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.      A  a    .     Whether a time for taking an action required by this title is reasonable depends onthe nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action.     An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no timeis agreed, at or within a reasonable time.      A  a    .Whenever this title creates a  presumption  with respect to a fact, or provides that a factis  presumed,  the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact unless and until evidence isintroduced that supports a finding of its nonexistence.      A  a    .     Except as provided in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation tothis state and also to another state or nation, the parties may agree that the law either of thisstate or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties.  Failing suchagreement, this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state.     Where one of the following provisions of this title specifies the applicable law, thatprovision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law,including the conflict of laws rules, so specified  a   rights of creditors against sold goods under Section       A            b   applicability of the chapter on leases under Sections       A  a         and       A  a          c   applicability of the chapter on bank deposits and collections under Section     A            d   applicability of the chapter on funds transfers under Section       A  a          e   applicability of the chapter on letters of credit under Section       A            f   applicability of the chapter on investment securities under Section       A            or g   law governing perfection, the effect of perfection or nonperfection, and the priorityof security interests and agricultural liens under Sections       A  a         through       A  a        .      A  a    .     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection     or elsewhere in this title, the effectof provisions of this title may be varied by agreement.     The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care prescribed by thistitle may not be disclaimed by agreement.  The parties, by agreement, may determine thestandards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standardsare not manifestly unreasonable.  Whenever this title requires an action to be taken within areasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.     The presence in certain provisions of this title of the phrase  unless otherwiseagreed,  or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may notbe varied by agreement under this section.      A  a    .     A  course of performance  is a sequence of conduct between the parties to aparticular transaction that exists if  a   the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeatedoccasions for performance by a party  and b   the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunityfor objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.     A  course of dealing  is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactionsbetween the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing acommon basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.     A  usage of trade  is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity ofobservance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observedwith respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage must beproved as facts.  If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similarrecord, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.     A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of tradein the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware isrelevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties  agreement, may give particular meaning tospecific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  Ausage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement isto occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , the express terms of an agreementand any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must beconstrued whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction isunreasonable  a   express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage oftrade  b   course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade  and c   course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.     Subject to Section       A          , a course of performance is relevant to show a waiveror modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.     Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unlessthat party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfairsurprise to the other party.      A  a    .Every contract or duty within this title imposes an obligation of good faith in itsperformance and enforcement.      A  a    .     The remedies provided by this title must be liberally administered to the end thatthe aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performedbut neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except asspecifically provided in this title or by other rule of law.     Any right or obligation declared by this title is enforceable by action unless theprovision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.      A  a    .A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in partwithout consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record.      A  a    .A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate ofinsurance, official weigher s or inspector s certificate, consular invoice, or any other documentauthorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of itsown authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.      A  a    .     A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance orassents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not therebyprejudice the rights reserved.  Such words as  without prejudice,   under protest,  or the likeare sufficient.     Subsection     does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.      A  a    .A term providing that one party or that party s successor in interest may acceleratepayment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral  at will  or when the party considers itself insecure,  or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do soonly if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance isimpaired.  The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the powerhas been exercised.      A  a    .An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation ofthe person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation byagreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated. Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or asubordinated creditor., a, Uniform Commercial Code   General Provisions,    course of performance,,     A  a          .............    ..    .    ..... aSubsection       A  a           Sections       A  a         andSections       A  a         andSections       A  a         andSections       A  a         and     A  a            h ............................................ a, Uniform Commercial Code   General Provisions, a........................ a, Uniform Commercial Code       A  a            h ................., Uniform Commercial Code   BankDeposits and Collections,.. aSection       A  a            A  a           Section       A  a       Subsection a, Uniform Commercial Code  ....... a, Uniform Commercial Code   a, Uniform Commercial Code       A  a            A  a            t Full text     Utah State Legislature             Legislators  By Session       Current  Alphabetical  Historical  Find by Address Map More   Bills  Bills Bill Requests Passed Bills      Bills  Keyword Search Reading Calendars Tracking Service More   Committees  All Committees Appropriations Commissions  Independent Legislative Ethics Commission Interim Standing Subcommittees Task Forces Bills In Committees   Utah Code   Constitution   Title Chapter Section Keyword Search   Utah Constitution Laws of Utah      ongoing Utah Territorial Laws  More   Senate  Main Page  About The Senate  Leadership  Roster  Seating Chart  District Maps  Extraordinary Sessions  Reading Calendars  Past Floor Debates  Senate Journals    House  Main Page About the House  Leadership  Roster  Seating Chart  District Maps  Reading Calendars  Past Floor Debates  Journals  Conflict of Interest Forms    Legislative Guide   Legislative Guide Civic Programs GRAMA  Records Requests    Publications  Search Publications Appropriations Audits Bagels   Briefings Briefing Papers Digest of Legislation Legislative Drafting Manual  Journals  Interim Highlights  Legislative Rules GRAMA  Records Requests  Public Email State Organization Charts YouTube Channel Requests for Proposals and Legal Notices More   Legislative Histories  Legislative History Resources How to Research Bill Drafting Research Files       Ongoing   Working Bills             Interim Committee Histories       Ongoing   Journals Past House Floor Debates Past Senate Floor Debates More   Staff Offices  All Legislative Offices Auditor General Fiscal Analyst Printing Research and General Counsel Staff Awards Job Opportunities More   Links of Interest  Utah Administrative Rules Courts Utah State Capitol State of Utah Federal Legislation More           Download Zipped Enrolled WordPerfect SB    .ZIP  Introduced  Amended  Status  Bill Documents  Fiscal Note  Bills Directory    S.B.

Subject to Subsection    , a person  receives  a notice or notification when                                  a   it comes to that person s attention  or                                 b   it is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of                           business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as                           the place for receipt of such communications.                                        Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is                           effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual                           conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the                           individual s attention if the organization had exercised due diligence.  An organization                           exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant                           information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with                           the routines.  Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to                           communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual s regular duties or                           the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be                           materially affected by the information.

Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is                           determined by the facts of each case.                                     A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration                           that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an                           obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and                                  a   the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life                           of the goods                                  b   the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods                           or is bound to become the owner of the goods                                  c   the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the                           goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance                           with the lease agreement  or                                 d   the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional                           consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease                           agreement.                                     A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely                              because                                  a   the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the                           right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair                           market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into                                  b   the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods                                  c   the lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing,                           recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs                                  d   the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods                                  e   the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater                           than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the                           renewal at the time the option is to be performed  or                                 f   the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is                           equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the                           option is to be performed.

An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no time                           is agreed, at or within a reasonable time.

Course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade.                                     A  course of performance  is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a                              particular transaction that exists if                                  a   the agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated                           occasions for performance by a party  and                                 b   the other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity                           for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.                                     A  course of dealing  is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions                           between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a                           common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.                                     A  usage of trade  is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of                           observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed                           with respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage must be                           proved as facts.  If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar                           record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.                                     A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade                           in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is                           relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties  agreement, may give particular meaning to                           specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  A                           usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is                           to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.                                     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , the express terms of an agreement                           and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be                           construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction is                           unreasonable                                  a   express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of                           trade                                  b   course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade  and                                 c   course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.                                     Subject to Section       A          , a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver                              or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.                                     Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless                           that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair                           surprise to the other party.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Obligation of good faith.                                Every contract or duty within this title imposes an obligation of good faith in its                           performance and enforcement.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Remedies to be liberally administered.                                     The remedies provided by this title must be liberally administered to the end that                           the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed                           but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as                           specifically provided in this title or by other rule of law.                                     Any right or obligation declared by this title is enforceable by action unless the                           provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Waiver or renunciation of claim or right after breach.                                A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in part                           without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Prima facie evidence by third party documents.                                A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of                           insurance, official weigher s or inspector s certificate, consular invoice, or any other document                           authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its                           own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Performance or acceptance under reservation of rights.                                        A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or                           assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby                           prejudice the rights reserved.  Such words as  without prejudice,   under protest,  or the like                           are sufficient.                                     Subsection     does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Option to accelerate at will.                                A term providing that one party or that party s successor in interest may accelerate                           payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral  at will  or when the party                            considers itself insecure,  or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so                           only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is                           impaired.  The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power                           has been exercised.                                Section   .    Section      A  a         is enacted to read                                   A  a    .  Subordinated obligations.                                An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of                           the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by                           agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated.                            Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a                           subordinated creditor.                                Section   .

The time of receipt of a payment order or communication canceling or amending a                             payment order is determined by the rules applicable to receipt of a notice stated in  Subsection                                 A                 Section       A  a       .

The statement of a rule in this chapter does not by itself require, imply, or negate                             application of the same or a different rule to a situation not provided for, or to a person not                             specified, in this chapter.
