Nothing in this section may                            be construed to affect the responsibility of the county attorney or district attorney to represent                            the state in those matters, in accordance with Section         a        .                                Section  .    Section      A  a         is amended to read                                    A  a    .  Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of                            state.                                     a   Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a                            parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the                            parent s children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves                            to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions                            or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s                            children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened                            protection against government interference with the parent s fundamental rights and liberty                            interests.                                 b   The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and                            management of the parent s children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist                            simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent s child is placed in                            the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing                            the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government                               action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or                            alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental                            unfitness, the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous                            termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s                            parents are adversaries.                                 c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and                            supervision of the child s natural parents.  A child s need for a normal family life in a                            permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships will usually best be met by                            the child s natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit, and the right of parents                            to conceive and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the                            Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The right of a fit, competent parent                            to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty                            interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United                            States.                                 d   The state recognizes that                                  i   a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,                            train, educate, provide for, and reasonably discipline the parent s children  and                                 ii   the state s role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.                                 e   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty                            to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their                            children.                                 f   Subsections     through     shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this                            Subsection    .                                     It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection                            from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,                            prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title   ,                            Chapter  a, Juvenile Court Act of     .  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest                            in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide                            for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a                            substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and                            proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take action for                               the welfare and protection of the parent s children.                                     When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,                            it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm.  Throughout its                            involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to                            protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families,                            rather than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.                                     When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s immediate safety                            or welfare, the division may obtain custody of the child for a planned period and place the child                            in a safe environment, in accordance with the requirements of Title   , Chapter  a, Part  ,                            Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.                                     In determining and making  reasonable efforts  with regard to a child, pursuant to                            the provisions of Section       A  a        , both the division s and the court s paramount concern                            shall be the child s health, safety, and welfare.  The desires of a parent for the parent s child                            shall be given full and serious consideration by the division and the court.                                     In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment,  or serious                           physical  severe abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make                             reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home,                            provide reunification services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                             This Subsection     does not exempt the division from providing court ordered services.                                     a   It is the division s obligation, under federal law, to achieve permanency for                            children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  If the use or continuation of  reasonable                            efforts,  as described in Subsections     and    , is determined to be inconsistent with the                            permanency plan for a child, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the                            child in accordance with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to                            finalize the permanent placement of the child.                                 b   If, because of  his  a parent s conduct or condition,  a  the parent is determined to                            be unfit or incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in                            Title   , Chapter  a, Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act, the welfare and best interest of                            the child is of paramount importance, and shall govern in determining whether that parent s                            rights should be terminated.                                     The state s right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health                               care for a child is subject to Subsection         a            n .

substantially endangered.                                  b   i   Prima facie evidence of the finding described in Subsection     a  i  is                             established if                                   A   a court previously adjudicated that the child suffered abuse, neglect, or dependency                             involving the parent  and                                  B   a subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency involving the parent occurs.                                  ii   For purposes of Subsection     a  iv , if the court finds that the parent knowingly                             allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice                             that the person physically  or  abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited the child, that fact                             constitutes prima facie evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically                              or  abused, sexually abused, or sexually exploited.                                       a   i   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether                             reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the                             child s home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued                             removal.                                     ii   If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child s                             parent or guardian through the provision of those services, the court shall place the child with                             the child s parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.                                  b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a , and in ordering and                             providing services, the child s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in                             accordance with federal law.                                       Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency                             situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that                             any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                                       In cases where actual sexual abuse  or , sexual exploitation, abandonment,  or                            serious physical  severe abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court                             has any duty to make  reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in                             the child s home, return a child to the child s home, provide reunification services, or attempt to                             rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                                       The court may not order continued removal of a child solely on the basis of                             educational neglect as described in Subsection         a             u   y  ii .                                       a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a child under this section, the                             court shall state the facts on which that decision is based.                                  b   If no continued removal is ordered and the child is returned home, the court shall                             state the facts on which that decision is based.                                       If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for                             the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if the child were returned home,                             the court shall order continued removal regardless of                                   a   any error in the initial removal of the child                                   b   the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions  or                                  c   any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child                             and Family Services.

B   In providing the services described in Subsection     d  i  A , the minor s health,                             safety, and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern, and the court shall so order.                                  ii   The court shall                                   A   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child                             and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division                                   B   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family                             plan in accordance with Subsection       A  a            e   and                                  C   identify on the record the responsibilities described in Subsection     d  ii  B , for                             the purpose of assisting in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable                             efforts, in accordance with state and federal law.                                  iii   A   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the                             date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home.

reunify a minor is determined                             to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section                                  a        , then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to                                   A   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and                                  B   complete

relative during the period                             described in Subsection     d  does not interrupt the running of the period.                                  f   i   If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted by                             the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time period for                             reunification services.                                  ii   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original                                removal of the minor.                                  iii   If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted                             within    days, in accordance with Section         a        .                                  g   With regard to a minor who is    months of age or younger at the time the minor is                             initially removed from the home, the court shall                                   i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,                             pursuant to Section         a          and                                  ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                             removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                             to comply with the child and family plan.                                  h   With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are                             ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six                             months from the date that reunification services were ordered                                   i   the court shall terminate reunification services  and                                  ii   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                                      a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                             permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a                             parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.                                  b   The court may determine that                                   i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate,                             based on the individual circumstances  and                                  ii   reunification services should not be provided.                                  c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor, and in                             making  reasonable efforts,  the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount                             concern.                                  d   i   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                             parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following                             circumstances exist                                   A   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified

suffering from a mental illness of such                                magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                   C   the

In determining whether a parent or parents have abandoned a child, it is prima facie                             evidence of abandonment that the parent or parents                                   a   although having legal custody of the child, have surrendered physical custody of the                             child, and for a period of six months following the surrender have not manifested to the child                             or to the person having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical                             custody or to make arrangements for the care of the child                                   b   have failed to communicate with the child by mail, telephone, or otherwise for six                             months                                   c   failed to have shown the normal interest of a natural parent, without just cause  or                                  d   have abandoned an infant, as described in Subsection         a    .        .                                      In determining whether a parent or parents are unfit or have neglected a child the                             court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances, conduct, or conditions                                   a   emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent that renders the                             parent unable to care for the immediate and continuing physical or emotional needs of the child                             for extended periods of time                                   b   conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or abusive                             nature                                   c   habitual or excessive use of intoxicating liquors, controlled substances, or                             dangerous drugs that render the parent unable to care for the child                                   d   repeated or continuous failure to provide the child with adequate food, clothing,                             shelter, education, or other care necessary for the child s physical, mental, and emotional health                             and development by a parent or parents who are capable of providing that care                                   e   with regard to a child who is in the custody of the division, if the parent is                             incarcerated as a result of conviction of a felony, and the sentence is of such length that the                                child will be deprived of a normal home for more than one year  or                                  f   a history of violent behavior.                                      A parent who, legitimately practicing the parent s religious beliefs, does not provide                             specified medical treatment for a child is not, for that reason alone, a negligent or unfit parent.                                      a   Notwithstanding Subsection    , a parent may not be considered neglectful or                             unfit because of a health care decision made for a child by the child s parent unless the state or                             other party to the proceeding shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that the health care                             decision is not reasonable and informed.                                  b   Nothing in Subsection     a  may prohibit a parent from exercising the right to                             obtain a second health care opinion.                                      If a child has been placed in the custody of the division and the parent or parents                             fail to comply substantially with the terms and conditions of a plan within six months after the                             date on which the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that                             failure to comply is evidence of failure of parental adjustment.                                      The following circumstances constitute prima facie evidence of unfitness                                   a   sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, injury, or death of a sibling of the child, or of any                             child, due to known or substantiated abuse or neglect by the parent or parents                                   b   conviction of a crime, if the facts surrounding the crime are of such a nature as to                             indicate the unfitness of the parent to provide adequate care to the extent necessary for the                             child s physical, mental, or emotional health and development                                   c   a single incident of life threatening or gravely disabling injury to or disfigurement                             of the child  or                                  d   the parent has committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to                             commit murder or manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide.                                 Section   .    Section        a         is amended to read                                       a    .
