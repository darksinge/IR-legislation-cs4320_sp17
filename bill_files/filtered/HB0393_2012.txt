After the granting of a motion, and prior to a full competency hearing, the court                           may order the Department of Human Services to evaluate the minor and to report to the court                           concerning the minor s mental condition.                                     The minor shall be evaluated by a mental health examiner with experience in                              juvenile forensic evaluations and juvenile brain development, who is not involved in the                           current treatment of the minor.                                 a   If it becomes apparent that the minor may be incompetent due to an intellectual                           disability, the mental health examiner shall be experienced in intellectual disability evaluations                           of minors.                                 b   If it becomes apparent that the minor may be incompetent due to a developmental                           disability, the mental health examiner shall be experienced in developmental disability                           evaluations of minors.                                 c   If it becomes apparent that the minor may be incompetent due to an intellectual                           disability or related condition, the examiner shall be experienced in intellectual disability or                           related condition evaluations of minors.                                     The petitioner or other party, as directed by the court, shall provide all information                           and materials to the examiners relevant to a determination of the minor s competency                           including                                  a   the motion                                  b   the arrest or incident reports pertaining to the charged offense                                  c   the minor s known delinquency history information                                  d   known prior mental health evaluations and treatments  and                                 e   consistent with    U.S.C. Sec.     G  b     E  ii  I , records pertaining to the                           minor s education.                                     The minor s parents or guardian, the prosecutor, defense attorney, and guardian ad                           litem, shall cooperate in providing the relevant information and materials to the examiners.                                     In conducting the evaluation and in the report determining if a minor is competent                           to proceed as defined in Subsection       A              , the examiner shall consider the impact of a                           mental disorder, intellectual disability, or related condition on a minor s present capacity to                                  a   comprehend and appreciate the charges or allegations                                  b   disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, or states of mind                                  c   comprehend and appreciate the range and nature of possible penalties, if applicable,                           that may be imposed in the proceedings against the minor                                  d   engage in reasoned choice of legal strategies and options                                  e   understand the adversarial nature of the proceedings                                     f   manifest appropriate courtroom behavior  and                                 g   testify relevantly, if applicable.                                     In addition to the requirements of Subsection    , the examiner s written report                           shall                                  a   identify the specific matters referred for evaluation                                  b   describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the evaluation and the                           purpose or purposes for each                                  c   state the examiner s clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue                           referred for evaluation by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the                           examiner could not give an opinion                                  d   state the likelihood that the minor will attain competency and the amount of time                           estimated to achieve it  and                                 e   identify the sources of information used by the examiner and present the basis for                           the examiner s clinical findings and opinions.                                     The examiner shall provide an initial report to the court, the prosecuting and                           defense attorneys, and the guardian ad litem, if applicable, within    days of the receipt of the                           court s order.  The report shall inform the court of the examiner s opinion concerning the                           competency and the likelihood of the minor to proceed.  In the alternative, the examiner may                           inform the court in writing that additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the                           examiner informs the court that additional time is needed, the court may grant, taking into                           consideration the custody status of the minor, up to an additional    days to provide the report                           to the court and counsel.  The examiner must provide the report within    days from the receipt                           of the court s order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional period of                           time to complete the evaluation and provide the report.                                      Any statement made by the minor in the course of any competency evaluation,                           whether the evaluation is with or without the consent of the minor, any testimony by the                           examiner based upon any statement, and any other fruits of the statement may not be admitted                           in evidence against the minor in any delinquency or criminal proceeding except on an issue                           respecting the mental condition on which the minor has introduced evidence.  The evidence                           may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the minor s competency.                                      Prior to evaluating the minor, examiners shall specifically advise the minor and                              the parents or guardian of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection     .                                      When the report is received the court shall set a date for a competency hearing                           which shall be held in not less than five and not more than    days, unless the court enlarges                           the time for good cause.                                      A minor shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of the                           evidence, finds the minor incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the proponent                           of incompetency to proceed.                                      If the court finds the minor incompetent to proceed, its order shall contain findings                           addressing each of the factors in Subsection    .                                Section  .    Section      A            is enacted to read                                   A       .  Disposition on finding of incompetency to proceed    Subsequent                            hearings    Notice to prosecuting attorneys.                                     If the court determines that the minor is not competent to proceed, the court shall                           notify the Department of Human Services of the finding, and allow the department    days to                           develop a six month attainment plan for the minor.                                     The attainment plan shall include                                  a   any services or treatment the minor has been or is currently receiving                                  b   any additional services or treatment the minor may require to attain competency                           within the six month time period                                  c   an assessment of the parent, custodian, or guardian s ability to access or provide any                           recommended treatment or services                                  d   any special conditions or supervision that may be necessary for the safety of the                           minor or others during the attainment period  and                                 e   the likelihood that the minor will attain competency in a six month period.                                     The department shall provide the attainment plan to the court, prosecutor, defense                           attorney, and guardian ad litem at least three days prior to the competency disposition hearing.                                     During the attainment period, the minor shall remain in the least restrictive                           custodial setting.  If the court orders the minor to be held in detention or placed outside of the                           home of the parent or guardian during the attainment period, the court shall make the following                           findings on the record                                  a   the placement is the least restrictive setting                                     b   the placement is in the best interest of the minor                                  c   the minor will have access to the services and treatment required by the attainment                           plan in the placement  and                                 d   the placement is necessary for the safety of the minor or others.                                     If the minor is held in detention pending placement in a less restrictive setting, the                           department shall locate and transfer the minor to the alternative placement within    days.                                     The court shall review the case at least once every three months to determine                           whether the placement is still the least restrictive appropriate placement.                                     At any time that the minor becomes competent to proceed, during the attainment                           period, the executive director of the Department of Human Services, or its designee, shall                           notify the court, prosecutor, defense attorney, and guardian ad litem.  The court shall hold a                           hearing with    business days of notice from the executive director.                                     If at any time, during the attainment period, the court finds that there is not a                           substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future, the court                           shall terminate the competency proceeding, dismiss the delinquency charges without prejudice,                           and release the minor from any custody order related to the pending delinquency proceeding,                           unless the prosecutor informs the court that commitment proceedings pursuant to Title   A,                           Chapter  , Services for People with Disabilities, or Title   A, Chapter   , Substance Abuse                           and Mental Health Act, will be initiated.  These commitment proceedings shall be initiated                           within seven days after the court s order, unless the court enlarges the time for good cause                           shown.  The minor may be ordered to remain in custody until the commitment proceedings                           have been concluded.                                     During the attainment period, the court may order a hearing or rehearing at anytime                           on its own motion or upon recommendations of any interested party or the executive director of                           the Department of Human Services.                                      At the conclusion of the attainment period, the department shall provide a report                           on the minor s progress towards competence.  The report shall address the minor s                                  a   compliance with the attainment plan                                  b   progress towards competency based on the issues identified in the original                           competency evaluation                                  c   current mental illness, intellectual disability, or related condition and need for                              treatment, if any  and                                 d   whether the minor has attained competency, or the likelihood of the minor attaining                           competency and the amount of time necessary to attain it.                                      The court on its own motion, or upon motion by either party or by the executive                           director, may order an updated juvenile competency evaluation to examine the minor and                           advise the court on the minor s current competency status and progress toward competency                           restoration.                                      Within    days of receipt of the report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine                           the minor s current status.  At the hearing, the burden of proving the minor is competent is on                           the proponent of competency.  The court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence                           whether the minor is competent to proceed.                                      If the minor has not attained competency after the initial six month attainment                           period but is showing reasonable progress towards attainment of competency, the court may                           extend the attainment period up to an additional six months.                                      If the minor does not attain competency within one year after the court initially                           finds the minor not competent to proceed, the court shall terminate the competency                           proceedings and dismiss the delinquency charges without prejudice.
