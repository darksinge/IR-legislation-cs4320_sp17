A governmental entity may charge a reasonable fee to cover the governmental       entity s actual cost of providing a record.  This fee shall be approved by the governmental       entity s executive officer.                 a   When a governmental entity compiles a record in a form other than that       normally maintained by the governmental entity, the actual costs under this section may include       the following              i   the cost of staff time for compiling, formatting, manipulating, packaging,       summarizing, or tailoring the record either into an organization or media to meet the person s       request              ii   the cost of staff time for search, retrieval, and other direct administrative costs for       complying with a request  and             iii   in the case of fees for a record that is the result of computer output other than word       processing, the actual incremental cost of providing the electronic services and products       together with a reasonable portion of the costs associated with formatting or interfacing the       information for particular users, and the administrative costs as set forth in Subsections           a  i  and  ii .             b   An hourly charge under Subsection     a  may not exceed the salary of the lowest       paid employee who, in the discretion of the custodian of records, has the necessary skill and       training to perform the request.             c   Notwithstanding Subsections     a  and  b , no charge may be made for the first       quarter hour of staff time.                 a   Fees shall be established as provided in this Subsection    .             b   A governmental entity with fees established by the Legislature              i   shall establish the fees defined in Subsection    , or other actual costs associated       with this section through the budget process  and             ii   may use the procedures of Section   J       to set fees until the Legislature       establishes fees through the budget process.             c   Political subdivisions shall establish fees by ordinance or written formal policy       adopted by the governing body.             d   The judiciary shall establish fees by rules of the judicial council.                 A governmental entity may fulfill a record request without charge and is       encouraged to do so  when  if it determines that              a   releasing the record primarily benefits the public rather than a person              b   the individual requesting the record is the subject of the record, or an individual       specified in Subsection   G          or      or             c   the requester s legal rights are directly implicated by the information in the record,       and the requester is impecunious.                 A governmental entity may not charge a fee for              a   reviewing a record to determine whether it is subject to disclosure, except as       permitted by Subsection     a  ii   or             b   inspecting a record.                 a   A person who believes that there has been an unreasonable denial of a fee       waiver under Subsection     may appeal the denial in the same manner as a person appeals       when inspection of a public record is denied under Section   G      .             b   The adjudicative body hearing the appeal              i   shall review the fee waiver de novo  and             ii   has the same authority when a fee waiver or reduction is denied as it has when the       inspection of a public record is denied.                 a   All fees received under this section by a governmental entity subject to       Subsection     b  shall be retained by the governmental entity as a dedicated credit.             b   Those funds shall be used to recover the actual cost and expenses incurred by the       governmental entity in providing the requested record or record series.                 a   A governmental entity may require payment of past fees and future estimated       fees before beginning to process a request if              i   fees are expected to exceed      or             ii   the requester has not paid fees from previous requests.             b   Any prepaid amount in excess of fees due shall be returned to the requester.                 This section does not alter, repeal, or reduce fees established by other statutes or       legislative acts.                  a   Notwithstanding Subsection     c , fees for voter registration records shall be       set as provided in this Subsection     .             b   The lieutenant governor shall              i   after consultation with county clerks, establish uniform fees for voter registration       and voter history records that meet the requirements of this section  and             ii   obtain legislative approval of those fees by following the procedures and       requirements of Section   J      .Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
