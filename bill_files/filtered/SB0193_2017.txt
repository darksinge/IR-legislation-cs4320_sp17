Section  .  Section   A        is amended to read                A       . Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission    Creation           Membership.                  There is created an independent commission called the Judicial Performance        Evaluation Commission consisting of    members, as follows               a   two members appointed by the president of the Senate, only one of whom may be a        member of the Utah State Bar               b   two members appointed by the speaker of the House of Representatives, only one        of whom may be a member of the Utah State Bar               c   four members appointed by the members of the Supreme Court, at least one of        whom, but not more than two of whom, may be a member of the Utah State Bar               d   four members appointed by the governor, at least one of whom, but not more than        two of whom, may be a member of the Utah State Bar  and              e   the executive director of the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice.                  a   The president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives        shall confer when appointing members under Subsections     a  and  b  to ensure that there is        at least one member from among their four appointees who is a member of the Utah State Bar.              b   Each of the appointing authorities may appoint no more than half of the appointing        authority s members from the same political party.              c   A sitting legislator or a sitting judge may not serve as a commission member.                  a   A member appointed under Subsection     shall be appointed for a four year        term.              b   A member may serve no more than three consecutive terms.                  At the time of appointment, the terms of commission members shall be staggered        so that approximately half of commission members  terms expire every two years.                  When a vacancy occurs in the membership for any reason, the replacement shall be        appointed for the unexpired term by the same appointing authority that appointed the member        creating the vacancy.                  a   Eight members of the commission constitute a quorum.              b   The action of a majority of the quorum constitutes the action of the commission,        except that a decision of the commission to recommend that a judge be retained or not be        retained may not be made except by a vote of at least six members. If because of absences the        commission is unable to have at least six votes recommending that a judge be retained or not        retained, the commission may meet a second time to consider whether to recommend that the        judge be retained or not retained.              c   If a vote on the question of whether to recommend a judge be retained or not be        retained ends in a tie or if a decision does not have six votes required by Subsection     b , the        commission may make no recommendation concerning the judge s retention.             Section  .  Section   A        is amended to read                A       . Judicial performance evaluations.                  Beginning with the      judicial retention elections, the commission shall prepare        a performance evaluation for               a   each judge in the third and fifth year of the judge s term if the judge is not a justice        of the Supreme Court  and              b   each justice of the Supreme Court in the third, seventh, and ninth year of the        justice s term.                  Except as provided in Subsection    , the performance evaluation for a judge under        Subsection     shall consider only the following information but shall give primary emphasis to        the information that is gathered and relates to the performance of the judge during the period        subsequent to the last judicial retention election of that judge or if the judge has not had a        judicial retention election, during the period applicable to the first judicial retention election               a   the results of the judge s most recent judicial performance survey that is conducted        by a third party in accordance with Section   A                      b   information concerning the judge s compliance with minimum performance        standards established in accordance with Section   A                      c   courtroom observation               d   the judge s judicial disciplinary record, if any               e   public comment solicited by the commission               f   information from an earlier judicial performance evaluation concerning the judge        except that the commission shall give primary emphasis to information gathered subsequent to        the last judicial retention election  and              g   any other factor that the commission               i   considers relevant to evaluating the judge s performance for the purpose of a        retention election  and              ii   establishes by rule.                  The commission shall make rules concerning the conduct of courtroom observation        under Subsection    , which shall include the following               a   an indication of who may perform the courtroom observation               b   a determination of whether the courtroom observation shall be made in person or        may be made by electronic means  and              c   a list of principles and standards used to evaluate the behavior observed.                  a   As part of the evaluation conducted under this section, the commission shall        determine whether to recommend that the voters retain the judge.              b   i   If a judge meets the minimum performance standards established in accordance        with Section   A       , there is a rebuttable presumption that the commission will        recommend the voters retain the judge.              ii   If a judge fails to meet the minimum performance standards established in        accordance with Section   A       , there is a rebuttable presumption that the commission        will recommend the voters not retain the judge.              c   The commission may elect to make no recommendation on whether the voters        should retain a judge if the commission determines that the information concerning the judge is        insufficient to make a recommendation.              d   i   If the commission deviates from a presumption for or against recommending the        voters retain a judge or elects to make no recommendation on whether the voters should retain        a judge, the commission shall provide a detailed explanation of the reason for that deviation or        election in the commission s report under Section   A       .              ii   If the commission makes no recommendation because of a tie vote, the commission        shall note that fact in the commission s report.                  a   The commission shall allow a judge who is the subject of a judicial performance        retention evaluation and who has not passed one or more of the minimum performance        standards on the midterm evaluation or on the retention evaluation to appear and speak at any        commission meeting, except a closed meeting, during which the judge s judicial performance        evaluation is considered.              b   The commission may invite any judge to appear before the commission to discuss        concerns about the judge s judicial performance.              c   i   The commission may meet in a closed meeting to discuss a judge s judicial        performance evaluation by complying with Title   , Chapter  , Open and Public Meetings Act.              ii   The commission may meet in an electronic meeting by complying with Title   ,        Chapter  , Open and Public Meetings Act.              d   Any record of an individual commissioner s vote on whether or not to recommend        that the voters retain a judge is a protected record under Title   G, Chapter  , Government        Records Access and Management Act.              e   i   A member of the commission, including a member of the Utah State Bar, may        not be disqualified from voting on whether to recommend that the voters retain a judge solely        because the member appears before the judge as an attorney, a fact witness, or an expert, so        long as the member is not a litigant in a case pending before the judge.              ii   Notwithstanding Subsection     e  i , a member of the commission shall disclose        any conflicts of interest with the judge being reviewed to the other members of the commission        before the deliberation and vote of whether to recommend that a judge be retained or not be        retained.              iii   Information disclosed under this Subsection     e  is a protected record under Title          G, Chapter  , Government Records Access and Management Act.               e    f   The commission may only disclose the final commission vote on whether or        not to recommend that the voters retain a judge.                  a   The commission shall compile a midterm report of its judicial performance        evaluation of a judge.              b   The midterm report of a judicial performance evaluation shall include information        that the commission considers appropriate for purposes of judicial self improvement.              c   The report shall be provided to the evaluated judge  and , the presiding judge of the        district in which the evaluated judge serves, and the Judicial Council.  If the evaluated judge is        the presiding judge, the midterm report shall be provided to the chair of the board of judges for        the court level on which the evaluated judge serves.              d   i   The commission may provide a partial midterm evaluation to a judge whose        appointment date precludes the collection of complete midterm evaluation data.              ii   For a newly appointed judge, a midterm evaluation is considered partial when the        midterm evaluation is missing a respondent group, including attorneys, court staff, court room        observers, or intercept survey respondents.              iii   A judge who receives partial midterm evaluation data may receive a statement in        acknowledgment of that fact on the judge s voter information pamphlet page.              iv   On or before the beginning of the retention evaluation cycle, the commission shall        inform the Judicial Council of the name of any judge who receives a partial midterm        evaluation.                  The commission shall identify a judge whose midterm evaluation               a   fails to meet minimum performance standards in accordance with Section          A        or as established by rule  or              b   otherwise demonstrates to the commission that the judge s performance would be of        such concern if the performance occurred in a retention evaluation that the judge would be        invited to appear before the commission in accordance with Subsection     b .                        The commission may make rules in accordance with Title   G, Chapter  ,        Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act, as necessary to administer the evaluation required by        this section.             Section  .  Section   A        is amended to read                A       . Judicial performance survey.

The commission may include an additional classification of respondents if the        commission               a   considers a survey of that classification of respondents helpful to voters in        determining whether to vote to retain a judge  and              b   establishes the additional classification of respondents by rule.                  All survey responses are anonymous, including comments included with a survey        response.                  If the commission provides any information to a judge or the Judicial Council, the        information shall be provided in such a way as to protect the confidentiality of a survey        respondent.
