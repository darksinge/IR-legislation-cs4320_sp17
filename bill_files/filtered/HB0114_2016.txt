In any prosecution for a violation of this chapter, evidence or proof which shows a        person or persons produced, manufactured, possessed, distributed, or dispensed a controlled        substance or substances, is prima facie evidence that the person or persons did so with        knowledge of the character of the substance or substances.

If the defense is established, it is a complete defense to the        charges.                   a   It is an affirmative defense that the person produced, possessed, or        administered a controlled substance listed in Section        .  if the person               i   was engaged in medical research  and              ii   was a holder of a valid license to possess controlled substances under Section               .              b   It is not a defense under Subsection      a  that the person prescribed or dispensed        a controlled substance listed in Section        . .                   It is an affirmative defense that the person possessed, in the person s body, a        controlled substance listed in Section        .  if               a   the person was the subject of medical research conducted by a holder of a valid        license to possess controlled substances under Section          and              b   the substance was administered to the person by the medical researcher.                   The application of any increase in penalty under this section to a violation of        Subsection     a  i  may not result in any greater penalty than a second degree felony.
