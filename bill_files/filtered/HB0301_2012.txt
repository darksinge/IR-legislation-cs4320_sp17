Section                is repealed and reenacted to read                                       .  Nonjudicial punishment.                                    The governor and the adjutant general of Utah may prescribe regulations governing                          the administration of nonjudicial punishment.                                    A service member subject to this chapter may request trial by military court in lieu                          of nonjudicial punishment at any time prior to imposition of nonjudicial punishment.                                a   Upon receipt of a timely request for trial by military court in lieu of nonjudicial                          punishment, the commanding officer may grant the request, or deny the request and continue                          with nonjudicial punishment proceedings.  If the commander denies the member s request for                          trial by military court, the commander may not impose limitations on personal liberty as a                          punishment under nonjudicial punishment proceedings.                                b   Denial of a request for trial by military court in lieu of nonjudicial punishment does                          not create a private right of action and is not subject to judicial review.                                    Any commanding officer in the Utah National Guard may, in addition to a                          reprimand, impose one or more of the punishments under this section without the intervention                          of a military court.                                    Punishment imposed by the governor, a general officer, or a full colonel upon                          officers within the general officer s or full colonel s command may include                                 a   forfeiture of not more than one half of one month s pay per month for three months                           and                                b   restriction to specific limited areas, with or without suspension from duty, for not                          more than    consecutive days.                                    Punishment imposed by the governor, a general officer, or a full colonel upon                          enlisted personnel within the general officer s or full colonel s command may include                                 a   forfeiture of not more than one half of one month s pay per month for two months                                 b   reduction of one or more pay grades if the imposing commander holds promotion                          authority over the grade from which the enlisted person was demoted                                 c   extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than    consecutive                          days  and                                d   restriction to specific limited areas, with or without suspension from duty, for not                          more than    consecutive days.                                       Punishment imposed by a commander of the grade of lieutenant colonel or major                          upon enlisted personnel within the lieutenant colonel s or major s command may include                                 a   forfeiture of not more than one half of one month s pay per month for two months                                 b   reduction of no more than two pay grades if the imposing commander holds                          promotion authority over the grade from which the enlisted person was demoted                                 c   extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than    consecutive                          days  and                                d   restriction to specific limited areas, with or without suspension of duty, for not                          more than    consecutive days.                                    Punishment imposed by a commander of the grade of captain or lieutenant upon                          enlisted personnel within the captain s or lieutenant s command may include                                 a   forfeiture of not more than one half of one month s pay for one month                                 b   extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than    consecutive                          days                                 c   restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not                          more than    consecutive days  and                                d   reduction of one pay grade if the imposing commander holds promotion authority                          over the grade from which the enlisted person was demoted.                                    If the imposed punishment includes both extra duties and restriction to specific                          areas, the commander may not impose the maximum amount of time designated for each of                          these punishments but shall apportion these punishments as if they were imposed                          consecutively.                                    a   The imposing commander or a successor in command may, at any time, suspend                          by probation                                 i   all or any part of the amount of the unexecuted punishment  and                                ii   a reduction in grade or a forfeiture imposed, whether or not executed.                                b   The imposing commander or a successor in command shall set the terms of                          probation for any suspended punishment.                                c   The imposing commander may, at any time, remit or mitigate any part or amount of                          the unexecuted punishment.  The imposing commander may also set aside in whole or in part                          the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges, and affected                             property.                                d   The imposing commander may mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay.                                e   The imposing commander may not mitigate punishment for a greater period of time                          than the original punishment.                                f   When mitigating a reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay, the amount of the                          forfeiture may not exceed the maximum allowable forfeiture the imposing commander could                          have originally imposed.                                     a   A service member punished under this section may appeal to the next superior                          commander in the service member s chain of command.  The next superior commander shall                          conduct a de novo review of both the findings and punishment under procedures provided by                           regulation.  The next superior commander may modify or set aside the findings or punishment,                           having the same options afforded the imposing commander as described in this section.  In no                           case may the next superior commander increase the severity of the findings or the amount of                           punishment originally imposed.                                 b   If two levels of command exist above the imposing commander, the service                           member, having exhausted the service member s first level of appeal, may appeal to the next                           superior commander.  If the matter originates with the governor, the adjutant general, or one                           level of command below the adjutant general, no right to a second appeal exists.  The decision                           of the adjutant general on an appeal of nonjudicial punishment is final and is not subject to                           further appeal or judicial review.                                 c   The decision of the governor or the adjutant general to impose nonjudicial                           punishment upon a service member is final and is not subject to further appeal or judicial                           review.                                 d   The imposing commander shall promptly forward any appeal to the next superior                           commander.  During the course of the appeal, the imposing commander may require the                           appellant to submit to the imposed punishment.                                      A superior commander shall first obtain a legal review from a judge advocate of                           the Utah National Guard before acting on an appeal from any of the following imposed                           punishments                                  a   fine or forfeiture of more than seven day s pay                                  b   reduction of one or more pay grades                                     c   extra duties for more than    days  or                                 d   restriction for more than    days.                                      Punishments imposed under this section, except forfeiture of pay, may not extend                           beyond the termination of the duty status of the punished individual.
