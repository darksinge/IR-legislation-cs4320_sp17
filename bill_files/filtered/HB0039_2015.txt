When the court awards custody and guardianship of a child with a relative or        friend               a   the court shall order that               i   the relative or friend assume custody, subject to the continuing supervision of the        court  and              ii   any necessary services be provided to the child and the relative or friend               b   the child and any relative or friend with whom the child is placed are under the        continuing jurisdiction of the court               c   the court may enter any order that it considers necessary for the protection and best        interest of the child               d   the court shall provide for reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from        whose custody the child was removed, unless parent time is not in the best interest of the child         and              e   the court shall conduct a periodic review no less often than every six months, to        determine whether               i   placement with the relative or friend continues to be in the child s best interest               ii   the child should be returned home  or              iii   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.

When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of the child s        parent and does not award custody and guardianship to another parent, relative, or friend under        this section, the court shall order that the child be placed in the temporary custody of the        Division of Child and Family Services, to proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be        provided with care and services in accordance with this chapter and Title   A, Chapter  a,        Child and Family Services.                   a   Any preferential consideration that a relative or friend is initially granted        pursuant to Subsection     expires     days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that        time period has expired, a relative or friend who has not obtained custody or asserted an        interest in a child, may not be granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.              b   When the time period described in Subsection      a  has expired, the preferential        consideration, which is initially granted to a natural parent in accordance with Subsection    ,        is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best interest of the        child.              c   Prior to the expiration of the     day period described in Subsection      a , the        following order of preference shall be applied when determining the person with whom a child        will be placed, provided that the person is willing, and has the ability, to care for the child               i   a noncustodial parent of the child               ii   a relative of the child               iii   subject to Subsection      d , a friend of a parent of the child , if the friend is a        licensed foster parent   and              iv   other placements that are consistent with the requirements of law.              d   In determining whether a friend is a willing and appropriate placement for a child,        neither the court, nor the division, is required to consider more than one friend designated by        each parent of the child.               e   If a parent of the child is not able to designate a friend who is a licensed foster        parent for placement of the child, but is able to identify a friend who is willing to become        licensed as a foster parent                 i   the department shall fully cooperate to expedite the licensing process for the friend         and                ii   if the friend becomes licensed as a foster parent within the time frame described in        Subsection      a , the court shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to        place the child with the friend.                    If, following the shelter hearing, the child is placed with a person who is not a        parent of the child, a relative of the child, a friend of a parent of the child, or a former foster        parent of the child, priority shall be given to a foster placement with a man and a woman who        are married to each other, unless it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with a        single foster parent.                   In determining the placement of a child, neither the court, nor the division, may        take into account, or discriminate against, the religion of a person with whom the child may be        placed, unless the purpose of taking religion into account is to place the child with a person or        family of the same religion as the child.Legislative Review Note     as of                 AMOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
