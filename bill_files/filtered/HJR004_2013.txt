Harper                                                         LONG TITLE                          Committee Note                               The Revenue and Taxation Interim Committee recommended this bill.                           General Description                                This joint resolution of the Legislature urges the United States Congress to require all                           retailers whose sales to consumers in the state exceed a minimum threshold to collect                           applicable sales taxes on the sales in the state.                           Highlighted Provisions                                This resolution                                .    urges the United States Congress to act to authorize states, subject to the enactment                           of any necessary state laws, to require all retailers whose sales to consumers in the                           state exceed a minimum threshold to collect applicable sales taxes on the sales in                           the state.                           Special Clauses                                None                                                    Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Quill v. North Dakota,                               U.S.            that the  dormant  or  negative  Commerce Clause of the Constitution of the                           United States prohibits a state from requiring a retailer to collect and remit sales tax on sales to                           consumers in the state unless the retailer has physical presence in the state                                   WHEREAS, the Supreme Court further held  that the underlying issue is not only one                           that Congress may be better qualified to resolve, but also one that Congress has the ultimate                           power to resolve                                  WHEREAS, the sales tax, as applied to consumer purchases, can be a transparent tax                           levied by state and local governments                                 WHEREAS, the sales tax is, from the individual consumer s perspective, one of the                           simplest taxes imposed by state and local governments                                 WHEREAS, a complex aspect of sales taxation, from the individual consumer s                           perspective, is the requirement to pay  use  tax directly to the state or locality when sales tax is                           not collected by the retailer                                 WHEREAS, the electronic commerce industry needs to be left free from government                           interference, and any argument in favor of taxing sales on the Internet is problematic in light of                           constitutional provisions regarding interstate commerce and interstate compacts                                 WHEREAS, because there are over  ,    state and local taxing jurisdictions in the                           United States, each with unique and changing definitions, rules, and holidays, the sales tax is,                           from a remote seller s perspective, one of the most complex and costly taxes imposed by state                           and local governments                                WHEREAS, less than half of the states have worked to make it simpler or less costly                           for retailers that collect and remit sales taxes in multiple states, and the largest states have not                           participated in simplification or cost reduction                                 WHEREAS, the sales tax is frequently both a state and local tax                                 WHEREAS, remote collection of the sales tax may help to strengthen state and local                           tax systems                                 WHEREAS, consumption taxes can be used to achieve competitiveness                                 WHEREAS, the sales tax has been a stable source of state and local revenue and                           provides some level of certainty for states and localities                                 WHEREAS, some proposed federal legislation authorizing states to require all retailers                           whose sales to consumers in those states exceed a minimum threshold to collect sales taxes has                           garnered support from some businesses and organizations                                WHEREAS, some of this federal legislation would allow states to improve the                           collection of legally owed taxes and thus provide flexibility to lower tax rates for all taxpayers                                    WHEREAS, despite the progress states have made in simplifying state sales tax                           collection for remote sellers, there remain some inequities between the burden of tax collection                           obligations imposed upon sellers with physical presence and the burdens those same                           obligations would impose on remote sellers serving consumers in multiple states without                           physical presence                                WHEREAS, any federal legislation should be fair to both in state and remote sellers,                           whether such legislation requires sales and use taxes to be collected on a point of sale or                           point of delivery basis  and                                WHEREAS, Congress, in considering federal legislation, should at least consider the                           following principles in the enactment of such federal legislation that would permit states to                           impose sales tax obligations on remote sellers                                  .  State provided or state certified tax collection and remittance software that is simple                           to implement and maintain                                 .  Immunity from civil lawsuits for retailers utilizing state provided or state certified                           software in tax collection and remittance                                 .  Tax audit accountability to a single state tax audit authority                                 .  Elimination of interstate tax complexity by streamlining taxable good categories                                 .  Adoption of a meaningful small business exception so that small, remote seller                           businesses are not adversely affected  and                                .  Fair compensation to the tax collecting retailer, taking into account such elements as                           the exchange fees retailers are charged for consumer credit card transactions, which fees apply                           equally to any state taxes collected on the purchase of goods sold as well as the actual purchase                           amount                                NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah                           urges Congress to enact legislation to authorize states, consistent with this resolution and                           principles of taxation espoused by national associations of legislators and governors, and                           subject to the enactment of any necessary state laws, to establish true fairness in state tax                           collection for both retailers having physical presence in a state and retailers who are remote                           sellers.                               BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah, having                           addressed the principles of fairness outlined in this resolution, urges Congress to require all                              retailers whose sales to consumers exceed a minimum threshold to collect and remit applicable                           sales taxes on sales in the state.                               BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the members of                           the United States House of Representatives and to the members of the United States Senate.
