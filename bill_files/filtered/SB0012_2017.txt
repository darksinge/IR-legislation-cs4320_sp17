Section          is amended to read                     . Conviction of lower degree of offense    Procedure and limitations.                 If at the time of sentencing the court, having regard to the nature and circumstances       of the offense of which the defendant was found guilty and to the history and character of the       defendant, and after having given any victims present at the sentencing and the prosecuting       attorney an opportunity to be heard, concludes it would be unduly harsh to record the       conviction as being for that degree of offense established by statute, the court may enter a       judgment of conviction for the next lower degree of offense and impose sentence accordingly.                 a   If the court suspends the execution of the sentence and places the defendant on       probation, whether or not the defendant is committed to jail as a condition of probation, the       court may enter a judgment of conviction for the next lower degree of offense               a    i   after the defendant has been successfully discharged from probation               b    ii   upon motion and notice to the prosecuting attorney               c    iii   after reasonable effort has been made by the prosecuting attorney to provide       notice to any victims               d    iv   after a hearing if requested by either party  under  described in Subsection            c   a  iii   and              e    v   if the court finds entering a judgment of conviction for the next lower degree       of offense is in the interest of justice.             b   In making the finding in Subsection     a  v , the court shall consider as a factor in       favor of granting the reduction that, subsequent to the defendant s conviction, the level of the       offense has been reduced by law.                 a   An offense may be reduced only one degree under this section, whether the       reduction is entered under Subsection     or    , unless the prosecutor specifically agrees in       writing or on the court record that the offense may be reduced two degrees.             b   In no case may an offense be reduced under this section by more than two degrees.                 This section does not preclude any person from obtaining or being granted an       expungement of his record as provided by law.                 The court may not enter judgment for a conviction for a lower degree of offense if              a   the reduction is specifically precluded by law  or             b   if any unpaid balance remains on court ordered restitution for the offense for which       the reduction is sought.                 When the court enters judgment for a lower degree of offense under this section,       the actual title of the offense for which the reduction is made may not be altered.                 a   A person may not obtain a reduction under this section of a conviction that       requires the person to register as a sex offender until the registration requirements under Title         , Chapter   , Sex and Kidnap Offender Registry, have expired.             b   A person required to register as a sex offender for the person s lifetime under       Subsection              c  may not be granted a reduction of the conviction for the offense or       offenses that require the person to register as a sex offender.                 As used in this section,  next lower degree of offense  includes an offense       regarding which              a   a statutory enhancement is charged in the information or indictment that would       increase either the maximum or the minimum sentence  and             b   the court removes the statutory enhancement pursuant to this section.            Section  .  Section        .  is amended to read                    . . Board authority to order expungement.                 Upon granting a pardon, the board shall issue an expungement order, directing any       criminal justice agency to remove the recipient s identifying information relating to the       expunged convictions from its records.             a   When a pardon has been granted, employees of the Board of Pardons and Parole       may not divulge any identifying information regarding the pardoned person to any person or       agency, except for the pardoned person.             b   The Bureau of Criminal Identification may not count pardoned convictions against       any future expungement eligibility.                 An expungement order, issued by the board, has at least the same legal effect and       authority as an order of expungement issued by a court, pursuant to Title   , Chapter   , Utah       Expungement Act.
