recognized that local exchange facilities are essential facilities and required incumbent                           telephone corporations to open their networks to competition by interconnecting with and                           providing network services to new entrants in a process to be overseen by federal regulators and                           the commission                                     b   competitive carriers continue to experience great difficulty in gaining access to the                           network of incumbent telephone corporations and, seven years after enactment of the                           Telecommunications Reform Act of     , the dominant local exchange carrier in the state                           continues to maintain dominant control over local access lines in its service territory                                  c   the incumbent telephone corporations do not have adequate incentives to open the local                           exchange markets to competition, and the commission does not have adequate enforcement powers                           to assure compliance with existing law, resulting in a situation where competition in the local                           exchange markets of the state has not developed as rapidly as contemplated by the Legislature or                           Congress                                  d   it is

prices for essential facilities and services must be regulated and based                           on forward looking costs that provide an expectation to investors that the competitive carriers will                           not be competitively disadvantaged relative to the incumbent telephone corporation                                  g   retail pricing for telecommunications services should

sufficient specificity to ensure that the standards, procedures, and                           requirements identified in Subsection     g  ii  are quantifiable and sufficient to determine ongoing                           compliance by the incumbent telephone corporation or its wholesale affiliate with the requirements                           of their interconnection agreements, including the
