section may seek judicial review.               ii   Judicial review of an informal adjudicative proceeding is a trial. Venue is in the district          court in the county in which the person resides.                   Any person who is dead, unconscious, or in any other condition rendering him          incapable of refusal to submit to any chemical test or tests is considered to not have withdrawn the          consent provided for in Subsection    , and the test or tests may be administered whether the                 person has been arrested or not.                  Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the test or tests shall be         made available to him.                  a   Only a physician, registered nurse, practical nurse, or person authorized under         Section        , acting at the request of a peace officer, may withdraw blood to determine the         alcoholic or drug content. This limitation does not apply to taking a urine or breath specimen.              b   Any physician, registered nurse, practical nurse, or person authorized under Section                 who, at the direction of a peace officer, draws a sample of blood from any person whom         a peace officer has reason to believe is driving in violation of this chapter, or hospital or medical          facility at which the sample is drawn, is immune from any civil or criminal liability arising from          drawing the sample, if the test is administered according to standard medical practice.                   a   The person to be tested may, at his own expense, have a physician of his own          choice administer a chemical test in addition to the test or tests administered at the direction of a          peace officer.               b   The failure or inability to obtain the additional test does not affect admissibility of the          results of the test or tests taken at the direction of a peace officer, or preclude or delay the test or          tests to be taken at the direction of a peace officer.               c   The additional test shall be subsequent to the test or tests administered at the direction          of a peace officer.                   For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the person          to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician, or other          person present as a condition for the taking of any test.                   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test or tests or any additional          test under this section, evidence of any refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or          proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was operating or          in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, any drug,          combination of alcohol and any drug, or while having any measurable controlled substance or          metabolite of a controlled substance in the person s body.

assessment of no points on minimum speeding          violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.               d   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations          occurring before a time limit set by the division.               ii   The time limit may not exceed three years.               iii   The division may also delete points to reward violation free driving for periods of          time set by the division.               e   i   By publication in two newspapers having general circulation throughout the state,          the division shall give notice of the number of points it has assigned to each type of traffic          violation, the time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level at which          the division will generally take action to deny or suspend under this section.               ii   The division may not change any of the information provided above regarding points                  without first giving new notice in the same manner.                  a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the         division shall immediately notify the licensee in writing and afford him an opportunity for a         hearing in the county where the licensee resides.              ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may         administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of         relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.              iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision made         after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made after a          hearing before the full membership of the division.               iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,          extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.               b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications          determined by the division regarding a person                i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination                ii   who is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle                iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities  that might make him dangerous          on the highways  or               iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to  drive a motor vehicle safely.                   a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state upon          receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed there          that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a license.               b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a          nonresident driver of a motor vehicle of any offense under the motor vehicle laws of this state,          forward a certified copy of the record to the motor vehicle administrator in the state where the          person convicted is a resident.                   a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a motor          vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be suspended or          revoked.               b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when his license has been          suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                           a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of         more than one year except               i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                   ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges         under Section                        iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports under         Subsection               and              iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section              a    .               b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until he shows          satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                c   Upon denying, suspending, or revoking a license, the division shall require that all          license certificates held by the person be surrendered to the division.                 d   At the end of the period of denial or suspension, the certificate surrendered shall be          returned to the licensee.                    a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative          Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any person without hearing          and without receiving a record of his conviction for a crime when the division has reason to          believe that the person s license was granted by the division through error or fraud or that the          necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is terminated.               b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that after          the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                    a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is incompetent          or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon written notice of at least five days to the          licensee require him to submit to an examination.               b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the          person s license, permit him to retain the license, or  grant a license subject to a restriction imposed          in accordance with Section         .               c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for          suspension or revocation of his license.                    A report authorized by Section          may not contain any evidence of a                  conviction for speeding on an interstate system in this state if the conviction was for a speed of less         than    miles per hour and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in writing by the         individual whose report is being requested.                   a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative         Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person if it has reason to         believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is required under Title           , Chapter   a, Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility, and has driven the motor vehicle or         permitted it to be driven within this state without the security being in effect.              b   Sections      a     and      a     regarding the surrender of license plates and          registration of motor vehicles and the requirement of proof of financial responsibility apply to          persons whose driving privileges are suspended under this Subsection     .               c   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this          subsection, the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.               d   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been          revoked by the division under this subsection may file a request for agency action requesting a          hearing.                    Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also disqualifies          any license issued to that person under Part   of this chapter.              Section   .
