This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                            AMENDS                                  A      , as renumbered and amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .    Section      A           is amended to read                                   A      .  Ineligibility for benefits.                               An individual is ineligible for benefits or credit for  purposes of establishing  a waiting                           period                                     a   For the week in which the claimant left work voluntarily without good cause, if so                           found by the division, and for each week thereafter until the claimant has performed services in                           bona fide, covered employment and earned wages for those services equal to at least six times the                           claimant s weekly benefit amount.                                b   A claimant shall not be denied eligibility for benefits if the claimant leaves work under                           circumstances of such a nature that it would be contrary to equity and good conscience to impose                           a disqualification.                                   c   The division shall, in cooperation with the employer, consider for the purposes of this                           chapter the reasonableness of the claimant s actions, and the extent to which the actions evidence                           a genuine continuing attachment to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the                           ineligibility of a claimant is contrary to equity and good conscience.                                 d   Notwithstanding any other subsection of this section, a claimant who has left work                          voluntarily to accompany, follow, or join the claimant s spouse to or in a new locality does so                          without good cause for purposes of Subsection    .                                     a   For the week in which the claimant was discharged for just cause or for an act or                           omission in connection with employment, not constituting a crime, which is deliberate, willful, or                           wanton and adverse to the employer s rightful interest, if so found by the division, and thereafter                           until the claimant has earned an amount equal to at least six times the claimant s weekly benefit                           amount in bona fide covered employment.                                b   For the week in which he was discharged for dishonesty constituting a crime or any                           felony or class A misdemeanor in connection with his work as shown by the facts, together with                           his admission, or as shown by his conviction of that crime in a court of competent jurisdiction and                           for the    next following weeks.  Wage credits shall be deleted from the claimant s base period,                           and are not available for this or any subsequent claim for benefits.                                    a   If the division finds that the claimant has failed without good cause to properly                           apply for available suitable work, to accept a referral to suitable work offered by the employment                           office, or to accept suitable work offered by an employer or the employment office.  The                           ineligibility continues until the claimant has performed services in bona fide covered employment                           and earned wages for the services in an amount equal to at least six times the claimant s weekly                           benefit amount.                                b   i   A claimant shall not be denied eligibility for benefits for failure to apply, accept                           referral, or accept available suitable work under circumstances of such a nature that it would be                           contrary to equity and good conscience to impose a disqualification.                                ii   The division shall consider the purposes of this chapter, the reasonableness of the                           claimant s actions, and the extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing attachment                           to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a claimant is contrary                           to equity and good conscience.                                c   In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual, the division shall                              consider the                                 i   degree of risk involved to his health, safety, and morals                                 ii   individual s physical fitness and prior training                                 iii   individual s prior earnings and experience                                 iv   individual s length of unemployment                                 v   prospects for securing local work in his customary occupation                                 vi   wages for similar work in the locality  and                                vii   distance of the available work from his residence.                                d   Prior earnings shall be considered on the basis of all four quarters used in establishing                           eligibility and not just the earnings from the most recent employer.  The division shall be more                           prone to find work as suitable the longer the claimant has been unemployed and the less likely the                           prospects are to secure local work in his customary occupation.                                e   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work is suitable, and benefits                           shall not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept                           new work under any of the following conditions                                 i   if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute                                 ii   if the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less                           favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality  or                                iii   if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a                           company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.                                    For any week in which the division finds that his unemployment is due to a stoppage                           of work that exists because of a strike involving his grade, class, or group of workers at the factory                           or establishment at which he is or was last employed.                                a   If the division finds that a strike has been fomented by a worker of any employer, none                           of the workers of the grade, class, or group of workers of the individual who is found to be a party                           to the plan, or agreement to foment a strike, shall be eligible for benefits.  However, if the division                           finds that the strike is caused by the failure or refusal of any employer to conform to the provisions                           of any law of the state or of the United States pertaining to hours, wages, or other conditions of                           work, the strike shall not render the workers ineligible for benefits.                                b   If the division finds that the employer, his agent or representative has conspired,                           planned, or agreed with any of his workers, their agents or representatives to foment a strike, that                              strike shall not render the workers ineligible for benefits.                                c   A worker may receive benefits if, subsequent to his unemployment because of a strike                           as defined in Subsection    , he has obtained employment and has been paid wages of not less than                           the amount specified in Subsection       A              and has worked as specified in Subsection                               A              f .  During the existence of the stoppage of work due to this strike the wages of the                           worker used for the determination of his benefit rights shall not include any wages he earned from                           the employer involved in the strike.                                     a   For each week with respect to which the claimant willfully made a false statement                          or representation or knowingly failed to report a material fact to obtain any benefit under the                          provisions of this chapter, and an additional    weeks for the first week the statement or                           representation was made or fact withheld and six weeks for each week thereafter  the additional                           weeks not to exceed    weeks.                                   b   The additional period shall commence on the Sunday following the issuance of a                           determination finding the claimant in violation of  Subsection    .                                      a   For that portion of benefits or credit for which the individual was not eligible, but                           received as a result of wilfully making a false statement or representation of, or knowingly failing                           to report, a material fact in seeking benefits or credit under this chapter.                                  c   Each   b   An individual found in violation of Subsection     a  shall repay to the                            division  the amount of benefits the claimant actually received and, as                                   i   that portion of benefits that the individual received under Subsection     a  as a result                           of a false statement, representation, or omission  and                                 ii   a civil penalty ,  that is the lesser of                                  A   an amount equal to  the benefits the claimant received by direct reason of his fraud.                            that imposed by Subsection     b  i   or                                 B       of the individual s weekly benefit amount for each week in which some portion                           of the benefit was received as a result of a false statement, representation, or omission.                                 c   The division may not provide benefits or waiting week credit, or otherwise take into                           account any earned wage credits for the purpose of paying benefits to an individual to whom                           Subsection     a  applies, until that individual has repaid to the division the amount required under                           Subsection     b .                                 d   The  penalty  amount  shall be regarded as any other penalty under this chapter.  These                              amounts shall  imposed by Subsection     b  may be  collectible  collected by civil action or                            warrant in the manner provided in  Subsections  Section     A               and     .                                  d   A claimant is ineligible for future benefits or waiting week credit, and any wage                           credits earned by the claimant shall be unavailable for purposes of paying benefits, if any amount                           owed under Subsection     remains unpaid.                                  e   Determinations under this Subsection     shall be  made only upon a sworn written                           admission of the claimant or after due notice and recorded hearing.  If a claimant waives the                           recorded hearing, a determination shall be made based upon all the facts that the division,                           exercising due diligence, has obtained.  Determinations by the division are  appealable in the same                            manner provided by this chapter for appeals from other benefit determinations.                                     For any week with respect to which or a part of which he has received or is seeking                            unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or the United                            States.  If the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally determines that                            he is not entitled to those unemployment benefits, this disqualification does not apply.                                     a   For any week with respect to which he is receiving, has received, or is entitled to                            receive remuneration in the form of                                  i   wages in lieu of notice, or a dismissal or separation payment  or                                 ii   accrued vacation or terminal leave payment.                                 b   If the remuneration is less than the benefits that would otherwise be due, he is entitled                            to receive for that week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced as provided in Subsection                               A             .                                     a   For any week in which the individual s benefits are based on service for an                            educational institution in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity and that                            begins during the period between two successive academic years, or during a similar period                            between two regular terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid sabbatical leave                            provided for in the individual s contract if the individual performs services in the first of those                            academic years or terms and if there is a contract or reasonable assurance that the individual will                            perform services in that capacity for an educational institution in the second of the academic years                            or terms.                                 b   For any week in which the individual s benefits are based on service in any other                            capacity for an educational institution, and  that week begins during a period between two                               successive academic years or terms if the individual performs those services in the first of the                            academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the                            services in the second of the academic years or terms.
