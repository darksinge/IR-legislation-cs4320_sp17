The aggregate        annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the        Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.              .  The Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds        adequate to meet the same  nor shall the Commission pledge the credit of any of the member        states, except by and with the authority of the member state.              .  The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.

The Commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee or        representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of        any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission        employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had        a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties,        or responsibilities  provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from        retaining his or her own counsel  and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or        omission did not result from that person s intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.              .

SECTION   .  COORDINATED DATABASE             A.  The Commission shall provide for the development and maintenance of a        coordinated database and reporting system containing licensure, adverse action, and significant        investigatory information on all licensed individuals in member states.             B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a member state        shall submit a uniform data set to the coordinated database on all individuals to whom this        compact is applicable as required by the rules of the Commission, including               .  Identifying information               .  Licensure data               .  Significant investigatory information               .  Adverse actions against an individual s license               .

D.  Member states contributing information to the coordinated database may designate        information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the        contributing state.             E.  Any information submitted to the coordinated database that is subsequently required        to be expunged by the laws of the member state contributing the information shall be removed        from the coordinated database.        SECTION   .  RULEMAKING             A.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set        forth in this Section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules and amendments shall become        binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.             B.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a        statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such rule shall have        no further force and effect in any member state.             C.  Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of        the Commission.             D.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and        at least sixty      days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted        upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking               .  On the website of the Commission  and              .  On the website of each member state EMS authority or the publication in which each        state would otherwise publish proposed rules.             E.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include               .  The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be        considered and voted upon               .  The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule               .  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person  and              .  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of        their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.             F.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit        written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.             G.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a        rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by               .  At least twenty five      persons               .  A governmental subdivision or agency  or              .  An association having at least twenty five      members.             H.  If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the Commission shall        publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.              .  All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of        the Commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at        the hearing not less than five     business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.              .  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to        comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.              .  No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is        made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the        transcript.  A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and        conditions as a transcript.  This subsection shall not preclude the Commission from making a        transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.              .  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each        rule.  Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by        this section.             I.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled        hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral        comments received.             J.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the        proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking        record and the full text of the rule.             K.  If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is        received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a        public hearing.             L.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and        adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided        that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be        retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety             days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this provision, an emergency        rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to               .  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare               .  Prevent a loss of Commission or member state funds               .  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by        federal law or rule  or              .  Protect public health and safety.             M.  The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct        revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical        errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any        revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission.  The revision shall be subject to        challenge by any person for a period of thirty      days after posting.  The revision may be        challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge        shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the        notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.  If        the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the        Commission.        SECTION   .  OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT             A.  Oversight              .  The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each        member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to        effectuate the compact s purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact and the rules        promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.              .  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or        administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact        which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.              .  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such        proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure        to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the        Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.             B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination              .  If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance        of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the        Commission shall              a.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature        of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and or any other action to be taken by        the Commission  and             b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.              .  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated        from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,        privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of        termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or        liabilities incurred during the period of default.              .  Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other        means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate        shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the        defaulting state s legislature, and each of the member states.              .  A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and        liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend        beyond the effective date of termination.              .  The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in        default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between        the Commission and the defaulting state.              .  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the        U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission        has its principal offices.  The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,        including reasonable attorney s fees.             C.  Dispute Resolution              .  Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes        related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non member        states.              .  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding        dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.             D.  Enforcement              .  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the        provisions and rules of this compact.              .  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States        District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its        principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of        the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both        injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing        member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney s fees.              .  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission.  The        Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.        SECTION   .  DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE        COMMISSION FOR EMS PERSONNEL PRACTICE AND        ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT             A.  The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is        enacted into law in the tenth member state.  The provisions, which become effective at that        time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the        promulgation of rules.  Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers        necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.             B.  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the Commission s initial adoption of        the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes        law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the        full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.             C.  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing        the same.              .  A member state s withdrawal shall not take effect until six     months after        enactment of the repealing statute.              .  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state s        EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of        this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.             D.  Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any        EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state        and a non member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.             E.  This Compact may be amended by the member states.  No amendment to this        Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the        laws of all member states.        SECTION   .  CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY             This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  If        this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact        shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states.  Nothing in this        compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
