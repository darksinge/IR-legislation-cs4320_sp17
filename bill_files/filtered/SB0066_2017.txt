special adjudicative proceeding, the administrative law judge may        take judicial notice of matters not in the administrative record, in accordance with Utah Rules        of Evidence, Rule    .              f   An administrative law judge may take any action in a special adjudicative        proceeding that is not a dispositive action.                   a   A person who files a petition for review has the burden of demonstrating that        an issue or argument raised in the petition for review has been preserved in accordance with        Subsection    .              b   The administrative law judge shall dismiss, with prejudice, any issue or argument        raised in a petition for review that has not been preserved in accordance with Subsection    .                   In response to a dispositive motion, within    days after the day on which oral        argument takes place, or, if there is no oral argument, within    days after the day on which the        reply brief on the dispositive motion is due, the administrative law judge shall               a   submit a proposed dispositive action to the executive director recommending full or        partial resolution of the special adjudicative proceeding, that includes               i   written findings of fact               ii   written conclusions of law  and              iii   a recommended order  or              b   if the administrative law judge determines that a full or partial resolution of the        special adjudicative proceeding is not appropriate, issue an order that explains the basis for the        administrative law judge s determination.                   For each issue or argument that is not dismissed or otherwise resolved under        Subsection      b  or     , the administrative law judge shall               a   provide the parties an opportunity for briefing and oral argument in accordance with        this section               b   conduct a review of the director s order or determination, based on the record        described in Subsections     b ,     c , and      e   and              c   within    days after the day on which the reply brief on the dispositive motion is        due, submit to the executive director a proposed dispositive action, that includes               i   written findings of fact               ii   written conclusions of law  and              iii   a recommended order.                   a   When the administrative law judge submits a proposed dispositive action to        the executive director, the executive director may               i   adopt, adopt with modifications, or reject the proposed dispositive action  or              ii   return the proposed dispositive action to the administrative law judge for further        action as directed.              b   On review of a proposed dispositive action, the executive director shall uphold all        factual, technical, and scientific agency determinations that are not clearly erroneous based on        the petitioner s marshaling of the evidence.              c   In reviewing a proposed dispositive action during a special adjudicative proceeding,        the executive director may take judicial notice of matters not in the record, in accordance with        Utah Rules of Evidence, Rule    .              d   The executive director may use the executive director s technical expertise in        making a determination.                   a   Except as provided in Subsection      b , the executive director may not        participate in an ex parte communication with a party to a special adjudicative proceeding        regarding the merits of the special adjudicative proceeding, unless notice and opportunity to be        heard are afforded to all parties involved in the proceeding.              b   The executive director may discuss ongoing operational matters that require the        involvement of a division director without violating Subsection      a .              c   Upon receiving an ex parte communication with a party to a proceeding, the        executive director shall place the communication in the public record of the proceeding and        afford all parties to the proceeding with an opportunity to comment on the communication.                          a   A party may seek judicial review in the Utah Court of Appeals of a        dispositive action in a special adjudicative proceeding, in accordance with Sections   G      ,          G      , and   G      .              b   An appellate court shall limit its review of a dispositive action of a special        adjudicative proceeding under this section to               i   the record described in Subsections     b ,     c ,      e , and      c   and              ii   the record made by the administrative law judge and the executive director during        the special adjudicative proceeding.              c   During judicial review of a dispositive action, the appellate court shall               i   review all agency determinations in accordance with Subsection   G         ,        recognizing that the agency has been granted substantial discretion to interpret its governing        statutes and rules  and              ii   uphold all factual, technical, and scientific agency determinations that are not        clearly erroneous based upon the petitioner s marshaling of the evidence.                          a   The filing of a petition for review does not               i   stay a permit order or a financial assurance determination  or              ii   delay the effective date of a permit order or a portion of a financial assurance        determination.              b   A permit order or a financial assurance determination may not be stayed or delayed        unless a stay is granted under this Subsection            .              c   The administrative law judge shall               i   consider a party s motion to stay a permit order or a financial assurance        determination during a special adjudicative proceeding  and              ii   within    days after the day on which the reply brief on the motion to stay is due,        submit a proposed determination on the stay to the executive director.              d   The administrative law judge may not recommend to the executive director a stay        of a permit order or a financial assurance determination, or a portion of a permit order or a        portion of a financial assurance determination, unless               i   all parties agree to the stay  or              ii   the party seeking the stay demonstrates that               A   the party seeking the stay will suffer irreparable harm unless the stay is issued               B   the threatened injury to the party seeking the stay outweighs whatever damage the        proposed stay is likely to cause the party restrained or enjoined               C   the stay, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest  and              D   there is a substantial likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the        merits of the underlying claim, or the case presents serious issues on the merits, which should        be the subject of further adjudication.              e   A party may appeal the executive director s decision regarding a stay of a permit        order or a financial assurance determination to the Utah Court of Appeals, in accordance with        Section   A      .                          a   Subject to Subsection             c , the administrative law judge shall        issue a written response to a non dispositive motion within    days after the day on which the        reply brief on the non dispositive motion is due or, if the administrative law judge grants oral        argument on the non dispositive motion, within    days after the day on which oral argument        takes place.              b   If the administrative law judge determines that the administrative law judge needs        more time to issue a response to a non dispositive motion, the administrative law judge may        issue a response after the deadline described in Subsection             a  if, before the deadline        expires, the administrative law judge gives notice to the parties that includes               i   the amount of additional time that the administrative law judge requires  and              ii   the reason the administrative law judge needs the additional time.              c   If the administrative law judge grants oral argument on a non dispositive motion,        the administrative law judge shall hold the oral argument within    days after the day on which        the reply brief on the non dispositive motion is due.
