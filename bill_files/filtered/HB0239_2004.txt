Section  .   Effective date.                                This bill takes effect on July  ,     .      Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM   This bill imposes a tax on sexually explicit businesses and escort services, and might be  challenged as violating the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The U.S.  Supreme Court has not decided a case addressing taxation of sexually explicit businesses or  escort services, but has decided cases involving a tax on other activities protected by the First  Amendment. Under those rulings, if this bill were challenged, a court would first determine  whether sexually explicit businesses and escort services are obscene, and not protected by the  First Amendment. If a court decides they are not obscene, and are therefore protected by the  First Amendment, the court could uphold the bill if the court determined that the tax is  necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.
