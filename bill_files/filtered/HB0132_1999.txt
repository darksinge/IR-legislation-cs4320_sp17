Tobacco Manufacturers Settlement and Responsibility Act                                         .  Title.                               The chapter is known as the  Tobacco Manufacturers Settlement and Responsibility Act.                                Section  .    Section                  is enacted to read                            Part  .  Model Tobacco Settlement Statute                                         .  Findings and purpose.                                    Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State and to the                          citizens of the State.  The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart                          disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco related                          deaths in the United States each year.  These diseases most often do not appear until many years                          after the person in question begins smoking.                                    Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the State.  Under certain                          health care programs, the State may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to                          eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may                          have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.                                    Under these programs, the State pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical                          assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.                                    It is the policy of the State that financial burdens imposed on the State by cigarette                          smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the State to the extent that such                             manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State or are found culpable by                          the courts.                                    On November   ,     , leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered                          into a settlement agreement, entitled the  Master Settlement Agreement,  with the State.  The                          Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present,                          and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the State                           tied in part to their volume of sales   to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of                          public health  and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and                          corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.                                    It would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who                          determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large,                          short term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have                          an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably.  It is thus in                          the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a                          source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short term profits                          and then becoming judgment proof before liability may arise.

The inflation adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the base amount by                               the inflation adjustment percentage applicable in that year.                                         The inflation adjustment percentage applicable to payments due in the year                                    shall be equal to the greater of    or the CPI .  For example, if the Consumer Price                               Index for December     , as released in January     , is    higher than the Consumer                               Price Index for December     , as released in January     , then the CPI  with respect                                  to a payment due in      would be   .  The inflation adjustment percentage applicable                               in the year      would thus be   .                                         The inflation adjustment percentage applicable to payments due in any year                               after      shall be calculated by applying each year the greater of    or the CPI  on the                               inflation adjustment percentage applicable to payments due in the prior year.  Continuing                               the example in Subsection     above, if the CPI  with respect to a payment due in                                    is   , then the inflation adjustment percentage applicable in      would be  .        ,                               an additional    applied on the    inflation adjustment percentage applicable in     ,                               and if the CPI  with respect to a payment due in      is   , then the inflation adjustment                               percentage applicable in      would be   .        , an additional    applied on the                                .         inflation adjustment percentage applicable in     .

Section   .   Effective date.                                This act takes effect on July  ,     .        Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM     This legislation raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns    This bill contains model language from the tobacco settlement agreement that the state entered into  with leading tobacco manufacturers on November   ,     , that, if enacted and diligently  enforced, protects the state against a potential three percent reduction in settlement monies for each  one percent decline in the market share of participating manufacturers.  In addition, the model  language protects the state in the event the model language is overturned in court by capping at      any reduction in tobacco settlement money due to a decline in market share.   Specifically,  the model language requires a tobacco manufacturer who did not participate in the  tobacco settlement agreement to either accept the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement  or pay a certain sum of money for each cigarette sold in the state into an escrow account  established by the manufacturer.   The purpose of the escrow account is to create a fund from  which the state can recover, should the state choose to bring a legal action against the  manufacturer, and to ensure that nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers do not enjoy a cost  advantage over participating tobacco manufacturers.  The escrow account terminates in    years.   Any money remaining in the account is returned to the tobacco manufacturer at that time.  Interest  on the account is regularly paid to the tobacco manufacturer.     While there are similarities between the model language and other Utah laws that mandate that  funds be set aside for future liabilities, there are differences as well.  As such, the legal  ramifications are not clear, particularly with respect to the authority of the state to     regulate out   of state tobacco manufacturers whose product was brought into the state through nonaffiliated  distributors  and     require nonparties to a  lawsuit to set aside funds to  a  create an escrow  account from which the state can recover in future litigation and  b  place the same financial  disadvantage on nonparties as were placed on parties to the lawsuit.
