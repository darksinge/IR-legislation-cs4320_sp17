The Legislature finds that public policy should promote and encourage a strong         civic sector.  Civic organizations have an important role that cannot be adequately addressed         through either private or public sector action.  Important public values such as the condition of         our neighborhoods, the character of our children, and the renewal of our cities directly depend         on the strength of families, neighborhoods, and grassroots community organizations, as well as         the vitality of private and religious institutions that care for those in need.  Civic organizations         transmit values between generations, encourage cooperation between citizens, and ensure that         our communities are livable and nurturing environments.  The value provided to the state by         civic organizations is called social capital.                     The purpose of this part is to promote the availability of social capital.                    Using social capital,  clients of and applicants  an applicant for services under this         chapter may receive a wide array of services  and supports  that cannot be provided by state         government alone.  Social capital links all parts of our society together by creating         opportunities for service and giving.  It facilitates trust and cooperation and enhances         investments in physical and human capital.                     In enacting this part, the       The Legislature recognizes                a   the constitutional limits of state government to sustain civic institutions that         provide social capital . While state government has always depended on these institutions, it                 b   that the state does not create  them  nor can it replace  them. This part recognizes          civic institutions  and               c   that state government  shall  should respect, recognize, and, wherever possible,         constitutionally encourage strong civic institutions that sustain a sense of community  and         humanize our lives .
