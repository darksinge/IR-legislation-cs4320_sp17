interest in the care  custody  and management of the                            parent s children   A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves                            to challenge or interfere with parental rights   A governmental entity must support any actions                            or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s                            children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened                            protection against

preventing                            the irretrievable destruction of family life   Prior to an adjudication of unfitness  government                            action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or                            alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest   Until the state proves parental                            unfitness  the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous                            termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s                            parents are adversaries                                  c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the

     to conceive and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the                            Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   The right of a fit  competent parent                            to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty                            interest that has long been protected
