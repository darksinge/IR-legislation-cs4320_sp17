determine adequacy of underground water supply                                     a   If  in the judgment of the state engineer or the district court  it is necessary to                           appoint a water commissioner for the distribution of water from any river system or water                           source  the commissioner shall be appointed for a four year term by the state engineer                                 b   The state engineer shall determine whether all or a part of a river system or other                           water source shall be served by a commissioner  and if only a part is to be served  the state                           engineer shall determine the boundaries of that part                                 c   The state engineer may appoint                                 i   more than one commissioner to distribute water from all or a part of a water source                            or                                ii   a

of a commissioner and after notice and hearing  the court may order the                           removal of the commissioner and direct the state engineer to appoint a successor                                      a   In addition to the power granted to the state engineer to appoint water                          commissioners for the distribution of water  the state engineer may  at any time  hold a hearing                           or upon a petition signed by not less than one third of the users of underground waters in any                          area as  defined by the state engineer  shall hold a hearing  to determine whether the                          underground water supply within such area is adequate for the existing claims                                   b   i   Notice of the hearing shall be given in a form and manner which  in the                          judgment of the state engineer  best suits local conditions                                   ii   The state engineer  may make a full investigation and provide findings for the                          hearing                                      c   If the findings show that the water supply is inadequate for existing claims  the                          state engineer shall divide  or request that the water commissioner divide  the water supply                          among the claimants entitled to the water in accordance with their respective rights                                 Section       Section                is enacted to read                                          Groundwater management plan                                     As used in this section                                 a    Critical management area  means a groundwater basin in which the groundwater                          withdrawals consistently exceed the safe yield                                 b    Safe yield  means the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a                          groundwater basin over a period of time without exceeding the long term recharge of the basin                           or unreasonably affecting the basin s physical and chemical integrity                                      a   The state engineer may regulate groundwater withdrawals within a specific                           groundwater basin by adopting a groundwater management plan in accordance with this section                           for any groundwater basin or aquifer or combination of hydrologically connected groundwater                           basins or aquifers                                  b   The objectives of a groundwater management plan are to                                  i   limit groundwater withdrawals to safe yield                                  ii   protect the physical integrity of the aquifer  and                                 iii   protect water quality                                  c   The state engineer shall adopt a groundwater management plan for a groundwater                           basin if more than     of the water right owners in the groundwater basin request that the state                           engineer adopt a groundwater management plan                                      a   In developing a groundwater management plan  the state engineer may consider                                  i   the hydrology of the groundwater basin                                  ii   the physical characteristics of the groundwater basin                                  iii   the relationship between surface water and groundwater  including whether the                           groundwater should be managed in conjunction with hydrologically connected surface waters                                  iv   the geographic spacing and location of groundwater withdrawals                                  v   water quality                                  vi   local well interference  and                                 vii   other relevant factors                                     b   The state engineer shall base the provisions of a groundwater management plan on                           the principles of prior appropriation                                  c   i   The state engineer shall use the best available scientific method to determine                           safe yield                                  ii   As hydrologic conditions change or additional information becomes available  safe                           yield determinations made by the state engineer may be revised by following the procedures                           listed in Subsection                                          a   i   Except as provided in Subsection     b   the withdrawal of water from a                           groundwater basin shall be limited to the basin s safe yield                                  ii   Before limiting withdrawals in a groundwater basin to safe yield  the state engineer                           shall                                  A   determine the groundwater basin s safe yield  and                                 B   adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater basin                                  iii   If the state engineer determines that groundwater withdrawals in a groundwater                           basin exceed the safe yield  the state engineer shall regulate groundwater rights in that                           groundwater basin based on the priority date of the water rights under the groundwater                           management plan  unless a voluntary arrangement exists under Subsection     c  that requires a                           different distribution                                  b   When adopting a groundwater management plan for a critical management area  the                           state engineer shall  based on economic and other impacts to an individual water user or a local                           community caused by the implementation of safe yield limits on withdrawals  allow gradual                           implementation of the groundwater management plan                                  c   i   In consultation with the state engineer  water users in a groundwater basin may                           agree to participate in a voluntary arrangement for managing withdrawals at any time  either                           before or after a determination that groundwater withdrawals exceed the groundwater basin s                           safe yield                                  ii   A voluntary arrangement under Subsection     c  i  shall be consistent with other                           law                                  iii   The adoption of a voluntary arrangement under this Subsection     c  by less than                           all of the water users in a groundwater basin does not affect the rights of water users who do                           not agree to the voluntary arrangement                                         To adopt a groundwater management plan  the state engineer shall                                  a   give notice as specified in Subsection     at least    days before the first public                           meeting held in accordance with Subsection     b                                   i   that the state engineer
