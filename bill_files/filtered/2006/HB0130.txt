                                             Rights and responsibilities of parties in adoption proceedings                                      The Legislature finds that the rights and interests of all parties affected by an                            adoption proceeding must be considered and balanced in determining what constitutional                            protections and processes are necessary and appropriate                                      The Legislature finds that                                  a   the state has a compelling interest in providing stable and permanent homes for                            adoptive children in a prompt manner  in preventing the disruption of adoptive placements  and                            in holding parents accountable for meeting the needs of children                                  b   an unmarried mother  faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions                            about the future of a newborn child  is entitled to privacy  and has the right to make timely and                            appropriate decisions regarding her future and the future of the child  and is entitled to                            assurance regarding the permanence of an adoptive placement                                  c   adoptive children have a right to permanence and stability in adoptive placements                                  d   adoptive parents have a constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interest in                            retaining custody of an adopted child  and                                 e   an unmarried biological father has an inchoate interest that acquires constitutional                               protection only when he demonstrates a timely and full commitment to the responsibilities of                            parenthood  both during pregnancy and upon the child s birth   The state has a compelling                            interest in requiring unmarried biological fathers to demonstrate that commitment by providing                            appropriate medical care and financial support and by establishing legal paternity  in                            accordance with the requirements of this chapter                                      a   In enacting  Subsection                      and  Sections            through                                             the Legislature prescribes the  conditions for determining whether an unmarried                            biological father s action is sufficiently prompt and substantial to require constitutional                            protection                                  b   If an unmarried biological father fails to grasp the opportunities to establish a                            relationship with his child that are available to him  his biological parental interest may be lost                            entirely  or greatly diminished in constitutional significance by his failure to timely exercise it                             or by his failure to strictly comply with the available legal steps to substantiate it                                  c   A certain degree of finality is necessary in order to facilitate the state s compelling                            interest   The Legislature finds that the interests of the state  the mother  the child  and the                            adoptive parents described in this section outweigh the interest of an unmarried biological                            father who does not timely grasp the opportunity to establish and demonstrate a relationship                            with his child in accordance with the requirements of this chapter                                  d   An unmarried biological father has the primary responsibility to protect his rights                                  e   An unmarried biological father is presumed to know that the child may be adopted                            without his consent unless he strictly complies with the provisions of this chapter  manifests a                            prompt and full commitment to his parental responsibilities  and establishes paternity                                      The Legislature finds that an unmarried mother has a right of privacy with regard to                            her pregnancy and adoption plan  and therefore has no legal obligation to disclose the identity                            of an unmarried biological father prior to or during an adoption proceeding  and has no                            obligation to volunteer information to the court with respect to the father                                 Section       Section                   is repealed and reenacted to read                                              Necessary consent to adoption or relinquishment for adoption                                      Except as provided in Subsection      consent to adoption of a child  or                           relinquishment of a child for adoption  is required from                                  a   the adoptee  if the adoptee is more than    years of age  unless the adoptee does not                              have the mental capacity to consent                                  b   both parents or the surviving parent of an adoptee who was conceived or born

been adjudicated to be the child s biological father by                           a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the mother s execution of consent to adoption or her                           relinquishment of the child for adoption                                  e   consistent with Subsection      any biological parent who has executed and filed a                           voluntary

an unmarried biological father of an adoptee  only if he strictly complies with the                           requirements of Subsections     through     and       and
