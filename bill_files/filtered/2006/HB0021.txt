      Section      A  a         is amended to read                                    A  a       Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of                            state                                      a   Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state  a                            parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care  custody  and management of the                            parent s children   A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves                            to challenge or interfere with parental rights   A governmental entity must support any actions                            or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s                            children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened                               protection against government interference with the parent s fundamental rights and liberty                            interests                                  b   The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care  custody  and                            management of the parent s children is recognized  protected  and does not cease to exist                            simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent s child is placed in                            the temporary custody of the state   At all times  a parent retains a vital interest in preventing                            the irretrievable destruction of family life   Prior to an adjudication of unfitness  government                            action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or                            alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest   Until the state proves parental                            unfitness  the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous                            termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s                            parents are adversaries                                  c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and                            supervision of the child s natural parents   A child s need for a normal family life in a                            permanent home  and for positive  nurturing family relationships will usually best be met by                            the child s natural parents   Additionally  the integrity of the family unit  and the right of parents                            to conceive and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the                            Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution   The right of a fit  competent parent                            to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a fundamental liberty                            interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United                            States                                  d   The state recognizes that                                  i   a parent has the right  obligation  responsibility  and authority to raise  manage                            train  educate  provide for  and reasonably discipline the parent s children  and                                 ii   the state s role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent                                   d    e   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and                            duty to exercise primary control over the care  supervision  upbringing  and education of their                            children                                   e    f   Subsections     through     shall be interpreted and applied consistent with                            this Subsection                                          It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection                               from abuse and neglect  and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating                             prosecuting  and punishing abuse and neglect  as defined in this chapter  and in Title                                Chapter  a  Juvenile Court Act of        Therefore  the state  as parens patriae  has an interest                            in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide                            for their welfare   There may be circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a                            substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and                            proper parental care and protection   Under those circumstances  the state may take action for                            the welfare and protection of the parent s children                                      When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused  neglected  or dependent child                             it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm   Throughout its                            involvement  the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to                            protect a child  in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable  permanent families                             rather than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state                                      When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s immediate safety                            or welfare  the division may obtain custody of the child for a planned period and place the child                            in a safe environment  in accordance with the requirements of Title     Chapter  a  Part                               Abuse  Neglect  and Dependency Proceedings                                      In determining and making  reasonable efforts  with regard to a child  pursuant to                            the provisions of Section       A  a          both the division s and the court s paramount concern                            shall be the child s health  safety  and welfare   The desires of a parent for the parent s child                            shall be given full and serious consideration by the division and the court                                      In cases where actual sexual abuse  abandonment  or serious physical abuse or                            neglect are established  the state has no duty to make  reasonable efforts  or to  in any other                            way  attempt to maintain a child in the child s home  provide reunification services  or to                            attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents   This Subsection     does not exempt the                            division from providing court ordered services                                      a   It is the division s obligation  under federal law  to achieve permanency for                            children who are abused  neglected  or dependent   If the use or continuation of  reasonable                            efforts   as described in Subsections     and      is determined to be inconsistent with the                            permanency plan for a child  then measures shall be taken  in a timely manner  to place the                            child in

 because of his conduct or condition  a parent is determined to be unfit or                            incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title                                Chapter  a  Part    Termination of Parental Rights Act  the welfare and best interest of the                            child is of paramount importance  and shall govern in determining whether that parent s rights                            should be terminated                                      The state s right to direct or intervene in the provision of medical or mental health                           care for a child is subject to Subsection         a            n                                  Section       Section      A  a         is amended to read

child to be in the physical presence of the alleged abuser  that fact                            constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of being physically or

                 ii   For purposes of Subsection     a  iv   if the court finds that the parent knowingly                               allowed the child to be in the physical care of a person after the parent received actual notice                            that the person physically or sexually abused the child  that fact constitutes prima facie                            evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically or sexually abused                                        a   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether                             reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from                             his home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued                             removal   If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or                             guardian

educational neglect as described in Subsection         a            s  ii                                         a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section  it

                   the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned home  it shall                             order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child  or the failure                             of a party to comply with notice provisions  or any other procedural requirement of this chapter                             or

            a   i   Whenever the court orders continued removal at the dispositional hearing                              and that the minor remain in the custody of the division  the court shall first                                   A   establish a primary permanency goal for the minor  and                                  B   determine whether  in view of the primary permanency goal  reunification services                             are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  pursuant to Subsection                                       ii   Subject to Subsection     b   if the court determines that reunification services are                             appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  the court shall provide for reasonable                             parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed  unless                             parent time is not in the best interest of the minor                                   iii   A   In cases where obvious sexual abuse  abandonment  or serious physical abuse                             or neglect are involved  neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                             efforts  or to  in any other way  attempt to provide reunification services  or to attempt to                             rehabilitate the offending parent or parents                                   B   In all cases  the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the court s paramount                             concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made                                   b   i   For purposes of Subsection     a  ii   parent time is in the best interests of a                             minor unless the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to                                   A   protect the physical safety of the minor                                   B   protect the life of the minor  or                                  C   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the                             minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect                                      ii   Notwithstanding Subsection     a  ii   a court may not deny parent time based                             solely on a parent s failure to                                   A   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or                                  B   comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court                                   c   i   In addition to the primary permanency goal  the court shall establish a concurrent                             permanency goal that shall include                                   A   a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal                             will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal  and                                  B   an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency                             goal                                   ii   A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection                                  a            b  within    days if something other than reunification is initially established as a                             minor s primary permanency goal                                   iii   A   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency goal before the                             establishment of a final permanency plan under Section         a                                           B   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event                             that the primary permanency goal is abandoned                                   C   If  at any time  the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s                             primary permanency goal  the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with                             Section         a         on or before the earlier of                                    I      days from the day on which the court makes the determination described in this                             Subsection     c  iii  C   or                                  II      months from the day on which the minor was first removed from the minor s                             home                                   d   i   A   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate  it shall                             order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor s                             parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family  for a specified period of time                                   B   In providing the services described in Subsection     d  i  A   the minor s health                              safety  and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern  and the court shall so order                                   ii   The court shall                                   A   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child                                and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division                                   B   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and

Subsection     d  ii  B   for                             the purpose of assisting in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable                             efforts  in accordance with state and federal law                                   iii   A   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the                             date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home                                   B   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire                                months of reunification services                                   iv   If reunification services are ordered  the court may terminate those services at any                             time                                   v   If  at any time  continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined                             to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to                              Subsection  Section       a          then measures shall be taken  in a timely manner  to                                   A   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and                                  B   complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the                             minor                                   e   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period                             described in Subsection     d  does not interrupt the running of the period                                   f   i   If reunification services are ordered  a permanency hearing shall be conducted by                             the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time period for                             reunification services                                   ii   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original                             removal of the minor                                   iii   If reunification services are not ordered  a permanency hearing shall be conducted                             within    days  in accordance with Section         a                                           g   With regard to a minor who is    months of age or younger at the time the minor is                             initially removed from the home  the court shall                                   i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal                              pursuant to Section         a          and                                     ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                             removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                             to comply with the child and family plan                                   h   With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are                             ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six                             months from the date that reunification services were ordered                                   i   the court shall terminate reunification services  and                                  ii   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights                                       a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                             permanency for minors who are abused  neglected  or dependent  the Legislature finds that a                             parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited                                   b   The court may determine that                                   i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate                              based on the individual circumstances  and                                  ii   reunification services should not be provided                                   c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor  and in                             making  reasonable efforts   the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the paramount                             concern                                   d   i   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                             parent if the court finds  by clear and convincing evidence  that any of the following                             circumstances exist                                   A   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown  based upon a verified affidavit                             indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                   B   subject to Subsection     d  ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such                             magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                   C   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or sexual                             abuse  and following the adjudication the minor                                   I   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent                                   II   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and                                  III   is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse                                   D   the parent

                       F   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent                              and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the                             offending parent                                   G   the parent s rights are terminated with regard to any other minor

those times                                   I   the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer  or                                  J   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification                             efforts or services                                   ii   The finding under Subsection     d  i  B  shall be based on competent

services  the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately                             caring for the minor within    months from the day on which the court finding is made                                       In determining whether reunification services are appropriate  the court shall take                             into consideration                                   a   failure of the
