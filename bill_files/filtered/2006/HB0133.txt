                                   a   The pawnbroker shall hold all articles pawned  or sold  to him for not fewer                           than    days after the date of receipt of the article  except that the pawnbroker may within this                           time period return an article to the person who pawned it                                 b    This  Subsection     a  does not preclude a law enforcement agency from                           requiring a pawnbroker to hold an article longer than    days if necessary in the course of an                           investigation                                     If a law enforcement agency seizes an article or requires the pawnbroker to hold an                           article as part of an investigation  the agency shall provide to the pawnbroker a hold ticket                           issued by the agency  which                                 a   states the active case number                                 b   confirms the date of the hold request and the article to be held  and                                   c   facilitates the pawnbroker s ability to track the article when the prosecution takes                           over the case                                     If an article is not seized by a law enforcement agency that has placed a hold on the                           property  the property may remain in the custody of the pawnbroker until further disposition by                           the law enforcement agency  and as consistent with this chapter                                     The initial hold by a law enforcement agency is for a period of    days   If the                           article is not seized by the law enforcement agency  the article shall remain in the custody of                           the pawnshop and is subject to the hold unless exigent circumstances require the pawned article                           to be seized by the law enforcement agency                                     a   A law enforcement agency may extend any hold for up to an additional    days                            when exigent circumstances require the extension                                  b   When there is an extension of a hold under Subsection     a   the requesting law                            enforcement agency shall notify the pawnshop subject to the hold prior to the expiration of the                            initial    days                                  c   A law enforcement agency may not hold an item for more than the    days allowed                            under Subsections     a  and  b  without obtaining a court order authorizing the hold                                      A hold on an article under Subsection     takes precedence over any request to                            claim or purchase the article subject to the hold                                      When the purpose for the hold on or seizure of an article is terminated  the law                            enforcement agency requiring the hold or seizure shall within    days after the termination                                  a   notify the pawnshop in writing that the hold or seizure has been terminated                                  b   return the article subject to the seizure to the pawnbroker  or                                 c   if the article is not returned to the pawnbroker  advise the pawnbroker either in                            writing or electronically of the specific alternative disposition of the article                                      If the article is subject to an investigation and a criminal prosecution results  the                            prosecuting agency shall  upon disposition of the case  request restitution to the pawnbroker for                            the crimes perpetrated against the pawnshop as a victim of theft by deception in addition to the                            request for restitution to the original victim                                      If the original victim of the theft of the property files a police report and the                            property is subsequently located at a pawnshop  the victim must fully cooperate with the                            prosecution of the crimes perpetrated against the pawnshop as a victim of theft by deception  in                               order to qualify for restitution regarding the property                                       If the victim does not wish to pursue criminal charges or does not cooperate in the                            prosecution of the property theft against the defendant and the theft by deception committed                            against the pawnshop  then the original victim must pay to the pawnshop the amount of money                            financed by the pawnshop to the defendant in order to obtain the property                                       a   The victim s cooperation in the prosecution of the property crimes and in the                            prosecution of the theft by deception offense committed against the pawnshop suspends the                            requirements of Subsections     and                                       b   If the victim cooperates in the prosecution under Subsection      a  and the                            defendants are convicted  the prosecuting agency shall direct the pawnshop to turn over the                            property to the victim                                  c   Upon receipt of notice from the prosecuting agency that the property must be turned                            over to the victim  the pawnshop shall return the property to the victim as soon as reasonably                            possible                                       A pawnshop must fully cooperate in the prosecution of the property crimes                            committed against the original victim and the property crime of theft by deception committed                            against the pawnshop in order to participate in any court ordered restitution                                       At all times during the course of a criminal investigation and subsequent                            prosecution  the article subject to a law enforcement hold shall be kept secure by the pawnshop                            subject to the hold unless the pawned article has been seized by the law enforcement agency                                 Section       Section                 is amended to read

property of                            another knowing that it has been stolen  or believing that it probably has been stolen  or who                            conceals  sells  withholds or aids in concealing  selling  or withholding the property from the                            owner  knowing the property to be stolen  intending to deprive the owner of it                                      The knowledge or belief required for Subsection     is presumed in the case of an                            actor who                                  a   is found in possession or control of other property stolen on a separate occasion                                  b   has received other stolen property within the year preceding the receiving offense                            charged  or

an agent  employee  or representative                            of a pawnbroker or person who buys  receives  or obtains property and fails to require the seller                            or person delivering the property to                                  i   certify  in writing  that he has the legal rights to sell the property  and                                  ii   provide a legible print  preferably the right thumb  at the bottom of the certificate                           next to his signature  and                                   iii    ii   provide at least one positive form of identification                                      Every pawnbroker or person who has or operates a business dealing in or collecting                            used or secondhand merchandise or personal property  and every agent  employee  or                            representative of a pawnbroker or person who fails to comply with the requirements of                            Subsection     c  is presumed to have bought  received  or obtained the property knowing it to                            have been stolen or unlawfully obtained   This presumption may be rebutted by proof                                      When  in a prosecution under this section  it appears from the evidence that the                            defendant was a pawnbroker or a person who has or operates a business dealing in or collecting                            used or secondhand merchandise or personal property  or was an agent  employee  or                            representative of a pawnbroker or person  that the defendant bought  received  concealed  or                            withheld the property without obtaining the information required in Subsection     d   then the
