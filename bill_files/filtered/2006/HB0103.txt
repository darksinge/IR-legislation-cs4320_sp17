reunification services                             are appropriate for  the minor  a child and  the minor s  a child s family  pursuant to Subsection

parent time is not in the best interest of the  minor  child                                   iii   A   In cases where obvious sexual abuse  abandonment  or serious physical abuse

Subsection     a  ii   parent time is in the best interests of a                              minor  child unless the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order

the alleged abuse or neglect                                   ii   Notwithstanding Subsection     a  ii   a court may not deny parent time based                             solely on a parent s

minor  child                             for a period of six months from the date that reunification services were ordered                                   i   the court shall terminate reunification services  and                                  ii   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights                                       a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                             permanency for  minors  children who are abused  neglected  or dependent  the Legislature                             finds that a parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited                                   b   The court may determine that                                   i   efforts to reunify a  minor  child with the  minor s  child s family are not reasonable                                or appropriate  based on the individual circumstances  and                                  ii

presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                             parent if the court finds  by clear and convincing evidence  that any of the following                             circumstances exist                                   A   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown  based upon a verified affidavit                             indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                   B   subject to Subsection     d  ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such                             magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                   C   the  minor  child was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or                             sexual abuse  and following the adjudication the  minor  child                                   I   was removed from the custody of the  minor s  child s

for the  minor  child within    months                             from the day on which the court finding is made                                       In determining whether reunification services are appropriate  the court shall take                             into consideration                                   a   failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a

the parent                                   ii   make a final determination regarding whether termination of parental rights                                 adoption  or permanent custody and guardianship is the most appropriate final plan for the                              minor  child  taking into account the  minor s  child s primary permanency goal established by                             the court pursuant to Section         a          and                                  iii   establish a concurrent plan that identifies the second most appropriate final plan

reunification services                             beyond    months from the date the  minor  child was initially removed from the  minor s                             child s home  in accordance with the provisions of Section         a          except that the court may                             extend reunification services for no more than    days if the court finds that                                   i   there has been substantial compliance with the child and family plan                                   ii   reunification is probable within that    day period  and                                  iii   the extension is in the best interest of the  minor  child                                   e   i   In no event may any reunification services extend beyond    months from the                             date the  minor  child was initially removed from the  minor s  child s home                                   ii   Delay or failure of a parent to establish paternity or seek custody does not provide a                             basis for the court to extend services for that parent beyond that    month period                                   f   The court may  in its discretion                                   i   enter any additional order that it determines to be in the best interest of the  minor                             child  so long as that order does not conflict with the requirements and provisions of                             Subsections     a  through  e   or                                  ii   order the division to provide protective

the final plan for the  minor  child is to proceed toward termination of parental                             rights  the petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed  and a pretrial held  within                                calendar days after the permanency hearing                                          a   Any party to an action may  at any time  petition the court for an
