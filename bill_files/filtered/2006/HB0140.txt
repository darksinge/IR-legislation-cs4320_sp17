Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA  dated  November           she indicated that the practice of issuing temporary commercial driver  licenses to out of state students at truck driving schools poses no threat to safety  that FMCSA  will hold off taking any action to withhold funding from a state due to noncompliance  and that  FMCSA will be initiating rulemaking to address the state of
