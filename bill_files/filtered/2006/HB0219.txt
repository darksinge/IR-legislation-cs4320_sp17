make a determination on the record as to whether                            reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from                            his home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued                            removal                                  ii   If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent                            or guardian through the provision of those services   it  the court shall place the minor with his                            parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division                                  b   In making  that  the determination described in Subsection      a   and in ordering

                Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency                            situation in which the child could not safely remain at home  the court shall make a finding that                            any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate                                       In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment  or serious physical abuse or                            neglect are involved  neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                            efforts  or to  in any other way  attempt to maintain a child in his home  return a child to his                            home  provide reunification services  or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents                                       The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of                            educational neglect as described in Subsection         a             s    u  ii                                        a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section   it                            the court shall state the facts on which that decision is based                                  b   If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home  the court shall                            state the facts on which that decision is based                                       If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for                            the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if  he  the child were returned                               home   it  the court shall order continued removal regardless of                                  a   any

first                                  A   establish a primary permanency goal for the minor  and                                 B   determine whether  in view of the primary permanency goal  reunification services                            are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  pursuant to Subsection                                      ii   Subject to Subsection     b   if the court determines that reunification services are                            appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  the court shall provide for reasonable                            parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed  unless                            parent time is not in the best interest of the minor                                  iii   A   In cases where obvious sexual abuse  abandonment  or serious physical abuse                            or neglect are involved  neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                            efforts  or to  in any other way  attempt to provide reunification services  or to attempt to                            rehabilitate the offending parent or parents                                  B   In all cases  the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the court s paramount                               concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made                                  b   i   For purposes of Subsection     a  ii   parent time is in the best interests of a                            minor unless the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to                                  A   protect the physical safety of the minor                                  B   protect the life of the minor  or                                 C   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the                            minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect                                  ii   Notwithstanding Subsection     a  ii   a court may not deny parent time based                            solely on a parent s failure to                                  A   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or                                 B   comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court                                  c   i   In addition to the primary permanency goal  the court shall establish a concurrent                            permanency goal that shall include                                  A   a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal                            will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal  and                                 B   an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency                            goal                                  ii   A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection                                 a            b  within    days if something other than reunification is initially established as a                            minor s primary permanency goal                                  iii   A   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency goal before the                            establishment of a final permanency plan under Section         a                                          B   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event                            that the primary permanency goal is abandoned                                  C   If  at any time  the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s                            primary permanency goal  the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with                            Section         a         on or before the earlier of                                   I      days from the day on which the court makes the determination described in this                            Subsection     c  iii  C   or                                 II      months from the day on which the minor was first removed from the minor s                            home                                     d   i   A   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate  it shall                            order that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor s                            parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family  for a specified period of time                                  B   In providing the services described in Subsection     d  i  A   the minor s health                             safety  and welfare shall be the division s paramount concern  and the court shall so order                                  ii   The court shall                                  A   determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the child                            and family plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division                                  B   determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and family

                    the purpose of assisting in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable                            efforts  in accordance with state and federal law                                  iii   A   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the                            date that the minor was initially removed from the minor s home                                  B   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire                               months of reunification services                                  iv   If reunification services are ordered  the court may terminate those services at any                            time                                  v   If  at any time  continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined                            to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to                            Subsection         a          then measures shall be taken  in a timely manner  to                                  A   place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan  and

by the parent or a relative during the period                            described in Subsection     d  does not interrupt the running of the period                                  f   i   If reunification services are ordered  a permanency hearing shall be conducted by                            the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time period for                            reunification services                                  ii   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original                               removal of the minor                                  iii   If reunification services are not ordered  a permanency hearing shall be conducted                            within    days  in accordance with Section         a                                          g   With regard to a minor who is    months of age or younger at the time the minor is                            initially removed from the home  the court shall                                  i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal                             pursuant to Section         a          and                                 ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                            removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                            to comply with the child and family plan                                  h   With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are                            ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six                            months from the date that reunification services were ordered                                  i   the court shall terminate reunification services  and                                 ii   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights                                      a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                            permanency for minors who are abused  neglected  or dependent  the Legislature finds that a                            parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited                                  b   The court may determine that                                  i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate                             based on the individual circumstances  and                                 ii   reunification services should not be provided                                  c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor  and in                            making  reasonable efforts   the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the paramount                            concern                                  d   i   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                            parent if the court finds  by clear and convincing evidence  that any of the following                            circumstances exist                                  A   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown  based upon a verified affidavit                            indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                  B   subject to Subsection     d  ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such                               magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                  C   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or sexual                            abuse  and following the adjudication the minor                                  I   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent                                  II   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and                                 III   is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse                                  D   the parent                                  I   caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect  or                                 II

have known that the person was abusing the                            minor                                  F   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent                             and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the                            offending parent                                  G
