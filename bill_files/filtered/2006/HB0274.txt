     This bill                                     provides that a county or prosecution district officer charged with a felony arising                           from official conduct is entitled to return to office if the charges are dismissed or the                           officer is acquitted but shall be removed from office if the officer is convicted or                           enters a plea of nolo contendere and that a conviction or plea of nolo contendere is                           considered to be a determination that the officer has committed malfeasance in                           office                                     provides that the removal process resulting from a conviction or nolo contendere                           plea does not replace another statutory removal process  and                                    eliminates a provision calling for county legislative body supervision of a person                           employed to discharge temporarily the duties of an officer on administrative leave                            Monies Appropriated in this Bill                                None                           Other Special Clauses

                        The failure of an elected county or prosecution district officer substantially to                           perform the officer s official duties constitutes malfeasance in office under Section                                                    a   If an elected county or prosecution district officer is charged with the                           commission of a felony arising from conduct related to the officer s official duties  the officer                           shall be placed on paid administrative leave by the county legislative body until  a court of
