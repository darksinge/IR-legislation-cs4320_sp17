license has been revoked by the Driver License Division                            under this section may seek judicial review.                                 ii   Judicial review of an informal adjudicative proceeding is a trial.  Venue is in the                            district court in the county in which the offense occurred.                                     Any person who is dead, unconscious, or in any other condition rendering him                            incapable of refusal to submit to any chemical test or tests is considered to not have withdrawn                            the consent provided for in Subsection    , and the test or tests may be administered whether                            the person has been arrested or not.

For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the                               person to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician,                            or other person present as a condition for the taking of any test.                                     If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test or tests or any                            additional test under this section, evidence of any refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal                            action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was                            operating or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,                            any drug, combination of alcohol and any drug, or while having any measurable controlled                            substance or metabolite of a controlled substance in the person s body.

This limitation does not                            apply to the taking of a urine  or , breath, or oral fluid specimen.                                 b   Any physician, registered nurse, practical nurse, or person authorized under Section                                         to draw blood under Section            .       who, at the direction of a peace officer, draws                            a sample of blood from any person whom a peace officer has reason to believe is flying in                            violation of this chapter, or hospital or medical facility at which the sample is drawn, is                            immune from any civil or criminal liability arising from drawing the sample, if the test is                            administered according to standard medical practice.                                     a   The person to be tested may, at the person s own expense, have a physician of                            the person s own choice administer a chemical test in addition to the test or tests administered                            at the direction of a peace officer.                                 b   The failure or inability to obtain the additional test does not affect admissibility of                            the results of the test or tests taken at the direction of a peace officer, or preclude or delay the                            test or tests to be taken at the direction of a peace officer.                                 c   The additional test shall be subsequent to the test or tests administered at the                            direction of a peace officer.                                     For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the                               person to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician,                            or other person present as a condition for the taking of any test.                                     If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test or tests or any                            additional test under this section, evidence of any refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal                            action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was                            operating or in actual physical control of an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol, any                            drug, or combination of alcohol and any drug.                                     The results of any test taken under this section or the refusal to be tested shall be                            reported to the Federal Aviation Administration by the peace officer requesting the test.                                Section  .    Section                  is amended to read                                           .  Standards for chemical breath analysis or oral fluids    Evidence.                                     The commissioner of the Department of Public Safety shall establish standards for                            the administration and interpretation of chemical analysis of a person s breath or oral fluids,                            including standards of training.                                     In any action or proceeding in which it is material to prove that a person was                            operating or in actual physical control of an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol or any                            drug or operating with a blood or breath alcohol content statutorily prohibited, documents                            offered as memoranda or records of acts, conditions, or events to prove that the analysis was                            made and the instrument used was accurate, according to standards established in Subsection                               , are admissible if                                  a   the judge finds that they were made in the regular course of the investigation at or                            about the time of the act, condition, or event  and                                 b   the source of information from which made and the method and circumstances of                            their preparation indicate their trustworthiness.                                     If the judge finds that the standards established under Subsection     and the                            conditions of Subsection     have been met, there is a presumption that the test results are valid                            and further foundation for introduction of the evidence is unnecessary.                                Section  .    Section                  is amended to read                                           .

Any person who carries a dangerous weapon while under the influence of alcohol                               or a controlled substance as defined in Section                 is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.                             Under the influence means the same level of influence or blood or breath alcohol concentration                            as provided  in  Section  Subsections                 a  i  through     a  iii .                                     It is not a defense to prosecution under this section that the person                                  a   is licensed in the pursuit of wildlife of any kind  or                                 b   has a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm.
