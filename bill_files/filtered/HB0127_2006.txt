Notwithstanding Section         c         , a limited liability company may make a                           limited distribution with respect to a series only.                                     No distribution may be made by a company under this section with respect to a                           series if, after giving effect to the distribution                                  a   the series would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual and                           regular course of its business  or                                 b   the value of the series  total assets would be less than the sum of                                  i   its total liabilities  and                                 ii   unless the articles of organization or the operating agreement permit otherwise, the                           amount that would be needed, if the series were to be dissolved and wound up at the time of the                           distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up of members                           whose preferential rights are superior to the rights of members receiving the distribution.                                     The company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under                           Subsection     either on                                  a   financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles                           that are reasonable in the circumstances  or                                 b   a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.                                     For purposes of this section, amounts constituting reasonable compensation for                           present or past services or reasonable payments made in the ordinary course of business                           pursuant to a bona fide retirement plan or other benefits program do not constitute a                           distribution.                                     A member who receives a distribution in violation of this section, and who knew at                              the time of the distribution that the distribution violated this section, is liable to the series for                           the amount of the distribution.                                     Subject to Section         c         , this section does not affect any obligation or                           liability of a member under an agreement or other applicable law for the amount of a                           distribution.                                Section  .    Section        c         is enacted to read                                     c    .  Member removal from a series    Effect.                                     Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member ceases to be                           associated with a series and to have the power to exercise any rights or powers of a member                           with respect to the series upon the assignment of all of the member s interest in the company                           with respect to the series.                                     Unless otherwise provided in an operating agreement, any event under this chapter                           or the operating agreement that causes a member to cease to be associated with a series does                           not, by itself                                  a   cause the member to cease to be associated with any other series                                  b   terminate the continued membership of a member in the limited liability company                            or                                 c   cause the termination of the series, regardless of whether the member is the last                           remaining member associated with the series.

Subject to Section         c         , except to the extent otherwise provided in the                           operating agreement, a series may be terminated and its affairs wound up without causing the                           dissolution of the limited liability company.                                     The termination of a series does not affect the limitation on liabilities of the series                           provided by Section         c        .
