The commissioner may adopt a rule dealing with the          determination of what constitutes     of the average amount paid by the insurer for comparable          services of preferred health care providers who are members of the same class of health care          providers  as provided in Section   A       .                c   When reimbursing for services of health care providers not under contract, the insurer          may make direct payment to the insured.                 d   Notwithstanding Subsection     b , an insurer using preferred health care provider          contracts may impose a deductible on coverage of health care providers not under contract.                 e    b   When selecting health care providers with whom to contract under Subsection    ,          an insurer may not unfairly discriminate between classes of health care providers, but may          discriminate within a class of health care providers, subject to Subsection    .                       f    c   For purposes of this section, unfair discrimination between classes of health care         providers shall include               i   refusal to contract with class members in reasonable proportion to the number of         insureds covered by the insurer and the expected demand for services from class members  and              ii   refusal to cover procedures for one class of providers  that are               A   commonly utilized by members of the class of health care providers for the treatment         of illnesses, injuries, or conditions               B   otherwise covered by the insurer  and              C   within the scope of practice of the class of health care providers.                   Before the insured consents to the insurance contract, the insurer shall fully disclose          to the insured that it has entered into preferred health care provider contracts.  The insurer shall          provide sufficient detail on the preferred health care provider contracts to permit the insured to          agree to the terms of the insurance contract.

All information, interviews, reports, statements, memoranda, or other data furnished          for purposes of the audit and any findings or conclusions of the auditors are privileged.   The          information is not subject to discovery, use, or receipt in evidence in any legal proceeding except                 hearings before the commissioner concerning alleged violations of this section.                  An insurer using preferred health care provider contracts shall provide a reasonable         procedure for resolving complaints and grievances initiated by the insureds and health care         providers.                  An insurer may not contract with a health care provider for treatment of illness or         injury unless the health care provider is licensed to perform that treatment.                  a   No health care provider or insurer may discriminate against a preferred health care         provider for agreeing to a contract under Subsection    .              b   Any health care provider licensed to treat any illness or injury within the scope of the          health care provider s practice, who is willing and able to meet the terms and conditions          established by the insurer for designation as a preferred health care provider, shall be able to apply          for and receive the designation as a preferred health care provider.

Upon the written request of a provider excluded from a provider contract, the          commissioner may hold a hearing to determine if the insurer s exclusion of the provider is based          on the criteria set forth in Subsection     b .                   Insurers are subject to the provisions of Sections   A       . ,   A       . , and            A       .
