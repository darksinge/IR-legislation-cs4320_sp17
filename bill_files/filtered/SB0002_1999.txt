      and maintenance costs.                               a   The amounts funded as listed in Subsection     are estimates only and do not                     constitute a limitation on the amount that may be expended for any project.                           b   The board may revise these estimates and redistribute the amount estimated for a project                     among the projects authorized.                           c   The commission, by resolution and in consultation with the board, may delete one or                     more projects from this list if the inclusion of that project or those projects in the list could be                     construed to violate state law or federal law or regulation.                               a   The division may enter into agreements related to these projects before the receipt of                     proceeds of bonds issued under this chapter.                           b   The division shall make those expenditures from unexpended and unencumbered                     building funds already appropriated to the Capital Projects Fund.                           c   The division shall reimburse the Capital Projects Fund upon receipt of the proceeds of                     bonds issued under this chapter.                           d   The commission may, by resolution, make any statement of intent relating to that                              reimbursement that is necessary or desirable to comply with federal tax law.                               a   For those projects for which only partial funding is provided in Subsection    , it is                     the intent of the Legislature that the balance necessary to complete the projects be addressed by                     future Legislatures, either through appropriations or through the issuance or sale of bonds.                           b   For those phased projects, the division may enter into contracts for amounts not to exceed                     the anticipated full project funding but may not allow work to be performed on those contracts in                     excess of the funding already authorized by the Legislature.                           c   Those contracts shall contain a provision for termination of the contract for the                     convenience of the state as required by Section                 .                           d   It is also the intent of the Legislature that this authorization to the division does not bind                     future Legislatures to fund projects initiated from this authorization.
