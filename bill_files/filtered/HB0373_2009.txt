constitute service of time toward the total probation term unless the probationer is exonerated                            at a hearing to revoke the probation.                                 ii   Any time served in confinement awaiting a hearing or decision concerning                            revocation of probation does not constitute service of time toward the total probation term                            unless the probationer is exonerated at the hearing.                                 b   The running of the probation period is tolled upon the filing of a violation report                            with the court alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of probation or upon the issuance                            of an order to show cause or warrant by the court.                                      a   i   Probation may not be modified or extended except upon waiver of a hearing                            by the probationer or upon a hearing and a finding in court that the probationer has violated the                            conditions of probation.                                 ii   Probation may not be revoked except upon a hearing in court and a finding that the                            conditions of probation have been violated.                                 b   i   Upon the filing of an affidavit alleging with particularity facts asserted to                            constitute violation of the conditions of probation, the court that authorized probation shall                            determine if the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or                            extension of probation is justified.                                 ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the                               defendant a warrant for the defendant s arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show                            cause why the defendant s probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.                                 c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall                            be served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.                                 ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.                                 iii   The order to show cause shall inform the defendant of a right to be represented by                            counsel at the hearing and to have counsel appointed  for him  if the defendant is indigent.                                 iv   The order shall also inform the defendant of a right to present evidence.                                 d   i   At the hearing, the defendant shall admit or deny the allegations of the affidavit.                                 ii   If the defendant denies the allegations of the affidavit, the prosecuting attorney                            shall present evidence on the allegations.                                 iii   The persons who have given adverse information on which the allegations are                            based shall be presented as witnesses subject to questioning by the defendant unless the court                            for good cause otherwise orders.                                 iv   The defendant may call witnesses, appear and speak in the defendant s own behalf,                            and present evidence.                                 e   i   After the hearing the court shall make findings of fact.                                 ii   Upon a finding that the defendant violated the conditions of probation, the court                            may order the probation revoked, modified, continued, or that the entire probation term                            commence anew.                                 iii   If probation is revoked, the defendant shall be sentenced or the sentence previously                            imposed shall be executed.
