Edgar Allen                       AN ACT RELATING TO THE CRIMINAL CODE  AMENDING LIMITATIONS ON TOTAL                      NUMBER OF YEARS OF SENTENCES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED FOR MULTIPLE                      OFFENSES.                      This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                       AMENDS                                   , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                          Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                           Section  .    Section                 is amended to read                                    .  Concurrent or consecutive sentences    Limitations    Definition.                               A court shall determine, if a defendant has been adjudged guilty of more than one felony                      offense, whether to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences for the offenses.  Sentences for                      state offenses shall run concurrently unless the court states in the sentence that they shall run                      consecutively.                               The court shall order that sentences for state offenses run consecutively if the later                      offense is committed while the defendant is imprisoned or on parole unless the court finds and                      states on the record that consecutive sentencing would be inappropriate.                               If an order of commitment does not clearly state whether the sentences shall run                      consecutively or concurrently, and the Board of Pardons and Parole has reason to believe that the                      later offense occurred while the person was imprisoned or on parole for the earlier offense, the                      board shall request clarification from the court.  Upon receipt of the request, the court shall enter                      an amended order of commitment stating whether the sentences are to run consecutively or                      concurrently.                               A court shall consider the gravity and circumstances of the offenses and the history,                      character, and rehabilitative needs of the defendant in determining whether to impose consecutive                      sentences.                                A court may impose consecutive sentences for offenses arising out of a single criminal                      episode as defined in Section                 .                               a   If a court imposes consecutive sentences, the aggregate maximum of all sentences                      imposed may not exceed    years imprisonment, except as provided under Subsection     b .                        However, this                            b   The limitation under Subsection     a  does not apply if                            i   an offense for which the defendant is sentenced authorizes the death penalty or a maximum                      sentence of life imprisonment .   or                           ii   the defendant is convicted of an additional offense based on conduct which occurs after                     his initial sentence or sentences are imposed.                               The limitation in Subsection     a  applies if a defendant                            a   is sentenced at the same time for more than one offense                            b   is sentenced at different times for one or more offenses, all of which were committed prior                      to imposition of the defendant s initial sentence  for any one or more of them   or                           c   has already been sentenced by a court of this state other than the present sentencing court                      or by a court of another state or federal jurisdiction, and the conduct giving rise to the present offense                     did not occur after his initial sentencing by any other court.                                In  When the limitation of Subsection     a  applies, determining the effect of                      consecutive sentences and the manner in which they shall be served, the Board of Pardons and Parole                      shall treat the defendant as though he has been committed for a single term that shall consist of the                      aggregate of the validly imposed prison terms as follows                            a   if the aggregate maximum term exceeds the    year limitation, the maximum sentence is                      considered to be    years  and                           b   when indeterminate sentences run consecutively, the minimum term, if any, constitutes                      the aggregate of the validly imposed minimum terms.                               When a sentence is imposed or sentences are imposed to run concurrently with the other                      or with a sentence presently being served, the lesser sentence shall merge into the greater and the                      greater shall be the term to be served.  If the sentences are equal and concurrent, they shall merge into                              one sentence with the most recent conviction constituting the time to be served.                                This section may not be construed to restrict the number or length of individual                      consecutive sentences that may be imposed or to affect the validity of any sentence so imposed, but                      only to limit the length of sentences actually served under the commitments.                                This section may not be construed to limit the authority of a court to impose consecutive                      sentences in misdemeanor cases.                                As used in this section,  imprisoned  means sentenced and committed to a secure                      correctional facility as defined in Section                , the sentence has not been terminated or voided,                      and the person is not on parole, regardless of where the person is located.
