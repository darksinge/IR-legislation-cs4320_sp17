direct soil and vegetation prescriptions that are demonstrated to restore                            forest and rangeland health,  increase forage, and improve watersheds in grazing districts and

management plan still in existence as of January  ,                                , a reasonable and fair portion of the increase in forage beyond the previously allocated                            total permitted use should be allocated to wildlife as recommended by a joint, evenly balanced                            committee of livestock and wildlife representatives that is appointed and

             there is a rational and scientific determination that the condition of the rangeland allotment or                            district in question will not sustain the animal unit months sought to be placed in suspended                            use                                  vii   any grazing animal unit months that are placed in a suspended use category should

            should recognize and uphold the preference for domestic grazing over alternate forage uses in                            established grazing districts while upholding management practices that optimize and expand                            forage for grazing and wildlife in conjunction with state wildlife management plans and                            programs in order to provide maximum available forage for all uses  and                                 ix   in established grazing districts, animal unit months that have been reduced due to                            rangeland health concerns should be restored to livestock when rangeland conditions improve,                            and should not be converted to wildlife use.
