Repealer.                               This bill repeals                                Section    A       ,  Use of credit information.

Effective date.                                  This bill takes effect on July  ,     .      Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM   This bill prohibits the use of credit information for any purpose related to personal lines  insurance.  Because the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act  FCRA  permits a credit agency to  provide credit reports to persons who intend to use the information in connection with the  underwriting of insurance and addresses insurance transactions not initiated by the consumer,  this bill might be challenged as being preempted by the FCRA.  The FCRA provides that it  does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person from complying with state law with respect  to the collection, distribution, or use of any information, except to the extent that the state law  is inconsistent with the FCRA.  The FCRA then expressly prohibits certain state laws. In  reviewing this bill it would be for a court to decide whether FCRA expressly preempts this bill  or whether this bill is consistent with the FCRA.
