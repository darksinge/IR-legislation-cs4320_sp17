Highlighted Provisions                                This bill                                .    provides that, if an insured is otherwise eligible for benefits under a policy, an                           accident and health insurer may not exclude coverage for                                    .    an inmate housed in a correctional facility  or                                   .    an offender in the custody of the Department of Corrections                                .    requires that an accident and health insurer coordinate benefits for an insured who                           is                                    .    an inmate housed in a correctional facility  or                                   .    an offender in the custody of the Department of Corrections  and                               .    requires an inmate who has medical or dental insurance coverage, upon entering                           into the Department of Correction s custody, to use that coverage as primary payer                           for medical and dental costs incurred while in the custody of the Department of                           Corrections.

Section      A            is amended to read                                   A       .  Permitted provisions for accident and health insurance policies.                               The following provisions may be contained in an accident and health insurance policy,                           but if they are in that policy, they shall conform to at least the minimum requirements for the                           policyholder in this section.                                    Any provision respecting change of occupation may provide only for a lower                           maximum benefit payment and for reduction of loss payments proportionate to the change in                           appropriate premium rates, if the change is to a higher rated occupation, and this provision                           shall provide for retroactive reduction of premium rates from the date of change of occupation                           or the last policy anniversary date, whichever is the more recent, if the change is to a lower                           rated occupation.                                    Section       A            applies to misstatement of age in accident and health policies,                           with the appropriate modifications of terminology.                                    Any policy which contains a provision establishing, as an age limit or otherwise, a                           date after which the coverage provided by the policy is not effective, and if that date falls                           within a period for which a premium is accepted by the insurer or if the insurer accepts a                           premium after that date, the coverage provided by the policy continues in force, subject to any                           right of cancellation, until the end of the period for which the premium was accepted.  This                           Subsection     does not apply if the acceptance of premium would not have occurred but for a                           misstatement of age by the insured.                                    a   If an insured is otherwise eligible for maternity benefits, a policy may not                              contain language which requires  an insured to obtain any additional preauthorization or                           preapproval for customary and reasonable maternity care expenses or for the delivery of the                           child after an initial preauthorization or preapproval has been obtained from the insurer for                           prenatal care.  A requirement for notice of admission for delivery is not a requirement for                           preauthorization or preapproval, however, the maternity benefit may not be denied or                           diminished for failure to provide admission notice.  The policy may not require the provision of                           admission notice by only the insured patient.                                b   This Subsection     does not prohibit an insurer from                                 i   requiring a referral before maternity care can be obtained                                 ii   specifying a group of providers or a particular location from which an insured is                           required to obtain maternity care  or                                iii   limiting reimbursement for maternity expenses and benefits in accordance with the                           terms and conditions of the insurance contract so long as such terms do not conflict with                           Subsection     a .                                    An insurer may only represent that a policy                                 a   offers a vision benefit if the policy                                 i   charges a premium for the benefit  and                                ii   provides reimbursement for materials or services provided under the policy  and                                b   covers laser vision correction, whether photorefractive keratectomy, laser assisted                           in situ keratomelusis, or related procedure, if the policy                                 i   charges a premium for the benefit  and                                ii   the procedure is at least a partially covered benefit.                                    If an insured is otherwise eligible for benefits under a policy, an accident and health                          insurer may not exclude coverage if the insured is an                                 a   inmate housed in a correctional facility as defined in Section                  or                                b   offender in the custody of the Department of Corrections.                               Section  .    Section      A            is amended to read                                   A       .  Coordination of benefits.                                    The commissioner shall adopt rules concerning the coordination of benefits                           between accident and health insurance policies.                                    Rules adopted by the commissioner under Subsection                                        a   may not prohibit coordination of benefits with individual accident and health                           insurance policies   and                                 b   shall apply equally to all accident and health insurance policies without regard to                           whether the policies are group or individual policies .   and                                c   shall require an accident and health insurer to coordinate benefits for an insured                          who is an                                 i   inmate housed in a correctional facility as defined in Section                  or                                ii   offender in the custody of the Department of Corrections.                               Section  .    Section                 is amended to read                                         .

The department, under its rules, may advance funds to any offender as necessary to                            establish the offender in a work release program.                                     a   The department or county jail may require an inmate to make a  reasonable                             copayment for medical and dental services provided by the department or county jail.                                 b   An inmate may not be denied medical treatment if he is unable to pay the                            copayment because of inadequate financial resources.
