Immediately following the assessment, the owner or operator of the assessed property        shall be notified of the assessment.  The assessor of the county in which the property is located shall        also be immediately notified of the assessment.                 Property assessed by the unitary method, which is not necessary to the conduct and does        not contribute to the income of the business as determined by the commission, shall be assessed        separately by the local county assessor.
