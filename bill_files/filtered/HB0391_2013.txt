The Legislature finds that                                 a   the people of the several states comprising the United States of America created the                             federal government to be their agent for certain enumerated purposes, and nothing more                                 b   the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States defines the total                          scope of federal power as being that which has been delegated by the people of the several                          states to the federal government, and all power not delegated to the federal government in the                          Constitution of the United States is reserved to the states respectively, or to the people                          themselves  and                                c   the assumption of power that the federal government has made by enacting the                          Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act interferes with the right of the people of the state of                          Utah to regulate health care as they see fit, and does not comply with the assurance in The                          Federalist Papers, No.     James Madison , that the  powers delegated  to the federal                          government are  few and defined,  while those of the states are  numerous and indefinite .                                    The Legislature declares that the federal law known as the Patient Protection and                          Affordable Care Act is not authorized by the Constitution of the United States and violates the                          constitution s true meaning and intent as given by the founders and ratifiers of the constitution,                          and is hereby declared to be invalid in this state, shall not be recognized by this state, is                          specifically rejected by this state, and shall be considered null and void and of no effect in this                          state.      Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM   As required by legislative rule and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General  Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its  own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The note is based on an analysis of  relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill. The note is not written for the  purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide  information relevant to legislators  consideration of this bill. The note is not a substitute for the  judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a law in the  context of a specific case.   This bill declares that the Affordable Care Act, which was passed by Congress, signed by the  President, and major portions of which were upheld as constitutional by a majority of the  United States Supreme Court, is invalid and without effect in the state of Utah because it  violates the true meaning of the Constitution of the United States.   The United States Supreme Court has determined that at least parts of the Affordable Care Act   are constitutional. See Nat l Federation of Business v. Sebelius, Sec y of Health and Human    Services,     S. Ct.            . Specifically, the Court determined that the individual  mandate and optional expansion of Medicaid was constitutional. There is a high probability  that a court would rule that the state s nullification of the Affordable Care Act is without effect  because a state cannot circumvent a federal court ruling. In Cooper v. Aaron,     U.S.  ,              , the Supreme Court asserted that if  the legislatures of the several states may, at will,  annul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under  those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery.    The ability of the state to nullify the portions of the Affordable Care Act that have not been  ruled upon by a court is uncertain. The asserted power to nullify federal statutes is largely  based on the compact theory of the union which argues that the United States was formed by a  compact between and agreed upon by the states.  In Bush v. Orleans Parish School Bd.,     F.  Supp.    ,      E.D. La.       aff d,     U.S.           , the court admitted that the compact  theory may have had some validity when the states were operating under the Articles of  Confederation, but that upon  their  the Article s  failure, however,  in Order to form a more  perfect Union,  the people, not the states, of this country ordained and established the  Constitution.  Bush,     F. Supp. at    . With the disavowal by the federal courts of the  compact theory, the retention by the states of the authority to nullify federal statutes is likely to  be in question.
