this chapter is then                            pending and the time for taking it has expired, the division may issue a warrant in duplicate,                            under its official seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding the sheriff                            to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of a delinquent employer or claimant found                            within the sheriff s county for the payment of the contributions due thereon, with the added                            penalties, interest, or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs, and to return the warrant to                            the division and pay into the fund the money collected by virtue of the warrant by a time to be                            specified in the warrant, not more than    days from the date of the warrant.                                 b   i   Immediately upon receipt of the warrant in duplicate, the sheriff shall file the                            duplicate with the clerk of the district court in the sheriff s county.                                 ii   The clerk shall enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors,                            the name of the delinquent employer or claimant mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate                            columns the amount of the contribution, penalties, interest, or benefit overpayment and                            penalties, and costs, for which the warrant is issued and the date when the duplicate is filed.                                 c   The amount of the docketed warrant shall                                  i   have the force and effect of an execution against all personal property of the                            delinquent employer  and                                 ii   become a lien upon the real property of the delinquent employer or claimant in the                            same manner and to the same extent as a judgment duly rendered by a district court and                            docketed in the office of the clerk.                                 d   After docketing, the sheriff shall                                  i   proceed in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to execution issued                            against property upon judgments of a court of record  and                                 ii   be entitled to the same fees for the sheriff s services in executing the warrant, to be                            collected in the same manner.                                     a   Contributions imposed by this chapter are a lien upon the property of an                               employer liable for the contribution required to be collected under this section who shall sell                            out the employer s business or stock of goods or shall quit business, if the employer fails to                            make a final report and payment on the date subsequent to the date of selling or quitting                            business on which they are due and payable as prescribed by rule.                                 b   i   An employer s successor, successors, or assigns, if any, are required to withhold                            sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of the contributions and interest or                            penalties due and payable until the former owner produces a receipt from the division showing                            that they have been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.                                 ii   If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold sufficient purchase                            money, the purchaser is personally liable for the payment of the amount of the contributions                            required to be paid by the former owner, interest and penalties accrued and unpaid by the                            former owner, owners, or assignors.                                     a   If an employer is delinquent in the payment of a contribution, the division may                            give notice of the amount of the delinquency by registered mail to all persons having in their                            possession or under their control, any credits or other personal property belonging to the                            employer, or owing any debts to the employer at the time of the receipt by them of the notice.                                 b   A person notified under Subsection     a  shall neither transfer nor make any other                            disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts until                                  i   the division has consented to a transfer or disposition  or                                 ii      days after the receipt of the notice.                                 c   All persons notified under Subsection     a  shall, within five days after receipt of                            the notice, advise the division of credits, other personal property, or other debts in their                            possession, under their control or owing by them, as the case may be.                                     a   i   Each employer shall furnish the division necessary information for the proper                            administration of this chapter and shall include wage information for each employee, for each                            calendar quarter.                                 ii   The information shall be furnished at a time, in the form, and to those individuals                            as the department may by rule require.                                    b   i   Each employer shall furnish each individual worker who is separated that                            information as the department may by rule require, and shall furnish within    hours of the                            receipt of a request from the division a report of the earnings of any individual during the                            individual s base period.                                 ii   The report shall be on a form prescribed by the division and contain all information                            prescribed by the division.                                 c   i   For each failure by an employer to conform to this Subsection     the division                            shall, unless good cause is shown, assess a     penalty if the filing was not more than    days                            late.                                 ii   If the filing is more than    days late, the division shall assess an additional penalty                            of     for each    days, or a fraction of the    days that the filing is late, not to exceed                                 per filing.                                 iii   The penalty is to be collected in the same manner as contributions due under this                            chapter.                                 d   The division shall prescribe rules providing standards for determining which                            contribution reports must be filed on magnetic media or in other machine readable form.  In                            prescribing these rules, the division                                  i   may not require any employer to file contribution reports on magnetic media unless                            that employer is required to file wage data on at least     employees during any calendar                            quarter                                  ii   shall take into account, among other relevant factors, the ability of the employer to                            comply at reasonable cost with the requirements of the rules  and                                 iii   may require an employer to post a bond for failure to comply with the rules                            required by this Subsection     d .                                     a   i   An employer liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall file                            Reimbursable Employment and Wage Reports.                                 ii   The reports are due on the last day of the month that follows the end of each                            calendar quarter unless the division, after giving notice, changes the due date.                                    iii   A report postmarked on or before the due date is considered timely.                                 b   i   Unless the employer can show good cause, the division shall assess a                                penalty against an employer who does not file Reimbursable Employment and Wage Reports                            within the time limits set out in Subsection     a  if the filing was not more than    days late.                                 ii   If the filing is more than    days late, the division shall assess an additional penalty                            of     for each    days, or a fraction of the    days that the filing is late, not to exceed                                 per filing.                                 iii   The division shall assess and collect the penalties referred to in this Subsection                                b  in the same manner as prescribed in Sections       A           and       A          .                                      If a person liable to pay a contribution or benefit overpayment imposed by this                            chapter neglects or refuses to pay it after demand, the amount, including any interest, additional                            amount, addition to contributions, or assessable penalty, together with any additional accruable                            costs, shall be a lien in favor of the division upon all property and rights to property, whether                            real or personal belonging to the person.                                      a   The lien imposed by Subsection      arises at the time the assessment, as                            defined in the department rules, is made and continues until the liability for the amount                            assessed, or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of the liability, is satisfied.                                 b   The lien imposed by Subsection      is not valid as against any purchaser, holder of                            a security interest, mechanics  lien holder, or judgment lien creditor until the division files a                            warrant  which meets the requirements of Subsection     has been filed  with the clerk of the                            district court.  For the purposes of this Subsection      b                                   i    Judgment lien creditor  means a person who obtains a valid judgment of a court of                            record for recovery of specific property or a sum certain of money, and who in the case of a                            recovery of money, has a perfected lien under the judgment on the property involved.  A                            judgment lien does not include inchoate liens such as attachment or garnishment liens until                            they ripen into a judgment.  A judgment lien does not include the determination or assessment                            of a quasi judicial authority, such as a state or federal taxing authority.                                 ii    Mechanics  lien holder  means any person who has a lien on real property, or on                               the proceeds of a contract relating to real property, for services, labor, or materials furnished in                            connection with the construction or improvement of the property.  A person has a lien on the                            earliest date the lien becomes valid against subsequent purchasers without actual notice, but not                            before the person begins to furnish the services, labor, or materials.                                 iii    Person  means                                  A   an individual                                  B   a trust                                  C   an estate                                  D   a partnership                                  E   an association                                  F   a company                                  G   a limited liability company                                  H   a limited liability partnership  or                                 I   a corporation.                                 iv    Purchaser  means a person who, for adequate and full consideration in money or                            money s worth, acquires an interest, other than a lien or security interest, in property which is                            valid under state law against subsequent purchasers without actual notice.                                 v    Security interest  means any interest in property acquired by contract for the                            purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation or indemnifying against loss or                            liability.  A security interest exists at any time                                  A   the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under the law                            against a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation  and                                 B   to the extent that, at that time, the holder has parted with money or money s worth.
