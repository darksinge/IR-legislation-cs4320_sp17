available, the division has reason to believe that a                            person is in violation of a requirement of this chapter or a permit condition required by this                            chapter, the division shall immediately order inspection of the mining operation at which the                            alleged violation is occurring, unless the information available to the

that a condition or                            practice exists, or that a permittee is in violation of a requirement of this chapter or a permit                            condition required by this chapter, and the condition, practice, or violation also creates an                            imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or is causing, or can reasonably be                            expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources,                            the division shall immediately order a cessation of mining and

division determines that the                            condition, practice, or violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated by                            the division.                                 iii   If the division finds that the ordered cessation of mining operations, or a portion of                            the operation, will not completely abate the imminent danger to the health or safety of the                            public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the                            division shall, in addition to the cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator                            requiring him to take whatever steps the division considers necessary to abate the imminent                            danger or the significant environmental harm.                                 c   i   If, on the basis of an inspection, the division determines that a permittee is in                            violation of a requirement of this chapter or a permit condition required by this chapter, but the                            violation does not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or cannot be                               reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water                            resources, the division shall issue a notice to the permittee or his agent specifying a reasonable                            time, but not more than    days, for the abatement of the violation and providing an                            opportunity for a conference with the division.                                 ii   If, upon expiration of the period of time as originally fixed or subsequently                            extended, for good cause shown, and upon the written finding of the division, the division finds                            that the violation has not been abated, it shall immediately order a cessation of mining                            operations or the portion of the mining operation relevant to the violation.                                 iii

          terminated by the division, but any notice or order issued under this section which requires                            cessation of mining by the operator shall expire within    days of the actual notice to the                            operator, unless a conference is held with the division.                                     a   The division may request the attorney general to institute a civil action for relief,                               including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or any other appropriate order                            in the district court for the district in which the mining and reclamation operation is located, or                            in which the permittee of the operation has his principal office, if the
