If a provider communicates with an individual                           primarily in a language other than English, the provider must furnish a translation into the other                           language of the disclosures and documents required by this chapter.                                Section   .    Section                  is enacted to read                                          .  Trust account.                                     All money paid to a provider by or on behalf of an individual pursuant to a plan for                           distribution to creditors is held in trust.  Within two business days after receipt, the provider                           shall deposit the money in a trust account established for the benefit of individuals to whom the                              provider is furnishing debt management services.                                     Money held in trust by a provider is not property of the provider or its designee.                            The money is not available to creditors of the provider or designee, except an individual from                           whom or on whose behalf the provider received money, to the extent that the money has not                           been disbursed to creditors of the individual.

A provider may not commingle money in a trust account established for the benefit                           of individuals to whom the provider is furnishing debt management services with money of                           other persons.                                     A trust account must at all times have a cash balance equal to the sum of the                           balances of each individual s account.                                     If a provider has established a trust account pursuant to Subsection    , the provider                           shall reconcile the trust account at least once a month.  The reconciliation must compare the                           cash balance in the trust account with the sum of the balances in each individual s account.  If                           the provider or its designee has more than one trust account, each trust account must be                           individually reconciled.                                        If a provider discovers, or has a reasonable suspicion of, embezzlement or other                           unlawful appropriation of money held in trust, the provider immediately shall notify the                           administrator by a method approved by the administrator.  Unless the administrator by rule                           provides otherwise, within five days thereafter, the provider shall give notice to the                           administrator describing the remedial action taken or to be taken.                                     If an individual terminates an agreement or it becomes reasonably apparent to a                           provider that a plan has failed, the provider shall promptly refund to the individual all money                           paid by or on behalf of the individual which has not been paid to creditors, less fees that are                           payable to the provider under Section                  .                                     Before relocating a trust account from one bank to another, a provider shall inform                           the administrator of the name, business address, and telephone number of the new bank.  As                           soon as practicable, the provider shall inform the administrator of the account number of the                           trust account at the new bank.
