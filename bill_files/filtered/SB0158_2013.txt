With respect to the general fund only, any accumulated fund balance                           is restricted to the following purposes                                    a   to provide working capital to finance expenditures from the beginning of the budget                           period until general property taxes, sales taxes, or other applicable revenues are collected,                           thereby reducing the amount  which  the city must borrow during the period, but this                           Subsection     a  does not permit the appropriation of any fund balance for budgeting purposes                           except as provided in Subsection                                     b   to provide a resource to meet emergency expenditures under Section                   and                                c   to cover a pending year end excess of expenditures over revenues from an                           unavoidable shortfall in revenues.  This provision does not permit the appropriation of any                           fund balance to avoid an operating deficit during any budget period except as provided under                           Subsection    , or for emergency purposes under Section                 .
