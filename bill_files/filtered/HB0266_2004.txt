Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of                            state.                                     a   i   Courts have recognized a general presumption that it is in the best interest                            and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of  his  the child s natural                            parents.  A child s need for a normal family life in a permanent home, and for positive,                            nurturing family relationships will usually best be met by  his  the child s natural parents.                                 ii   Additionally, the integrity of the family unit, and the right of parents to conceive                            and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth                            Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The right of a fit, competent parent to raise                             his  the parent s child has long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of                               the United States.                                 b   i   The state recognizes that                                  A   parents have the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to manage, train,                           educate, provide for, and discipline their children  and                                 B   the state s role is secondary and supportive to that primary role of the parents.                                  b    ii   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and                            duty to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their                            children who are in their custody . , including the right to make decisions regarding the                           discipline and provision of medical and mental health care to their children.                                 iii   The state s right to order or intervene in the provision of medical and mental health                           care for a minor is limited as provided in Subsection         a            n .                                 c   i   It is the public policy of this state that a parent or guardian has the right to                           reasonably discipline a child, which includes the use of physical and emotional discipline.                            Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the appropriate exercise of this right is not                           grounds for punishment, restriction, disqualification, or surveillance of any kind, including                                  A   arrest or criminal liability of any kind                                  B   award or change of physical custody of a child                                  C   issuance of a protective order                                  D   required reporting or investigation by any person  and                                 E   withholding licensing.                                 ii   Discipline by a parent is presumed to be reasonable if it does not constitute serious                           physical abuse or mental cruelty.  This presumption may only be rebutted by evidence                           establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that                                  A   a reasonable person acting under the existing circumstances would expect the                           discipline to create a substantial risk of physical abuse of, or mental cruelty to, the child                                  B   the discipline was not justified under Section                   or                                 C   the discipline constitutes the use of unreasonable or unnecessary physical restraint                           or force in self defense or other circumstances                                  I   to obtain possession of a weapon or other dangerous object in the possession or                           under the control of a child  or                                 II   to protect the child or another person from physical injury.                                        a   It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection                            from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,                            prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title   ,                            Chapter  a.  Therefore, as a counterweight to parental rights, the state , as parens patriae,  has                            an interest in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not                            adequately provide for their  welfare  health and safety.                                 b   There are circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a substantial                            departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and  proper                            adequate parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the  welfare  health, safety,                            and protection of children is  the  a consideration of  paramount  primary importance.                                     When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,                            it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate serious harm.                             Throughout its involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive means available to                            protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent                            families ,  rather than in temporary foster and other placements under the supervision of the                            state.                                     When circumstances within the family pose  a  an immediate serious threat to the                            child s health or safety  or welfare , the state s interest in the child s welfare is paramount to the                            rights of a parent.

This                                  b   Subsection     a  does not exempt the division from providing court ordered                            services.                                        a   It is the division s obligation, under federal law, to achieve permanency for                            children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  If the use or continuation of  reasonable                            efforts,  as described in Subsections     and    , is determined to be inconsistent with the                            permanency plan for a child, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the                            child in accordance with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to                            finalize the permanent placement of the child.                                 b   If, because of  his  a parent s conduct or condition,  a  the parent is determined to                            be unfit or incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in                            Title   , Chapter  a, Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act, the  welfare  health, safety,                            and best interest of the child is of paramount importance, and shall govern in determining                            whether that parent s rights should be terminated.

In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or                             neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                             efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in  his  the child s home, return a                             child to  his  the child s home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the                             offending parent or parents.                                       The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of                             educational neglect  as described in Subsection         a            s  ii  .                                       a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it                             shall state the facts on which that decision is based.                                  b   If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall                             state the facts on which that decision is based.                                       If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for                             the protection of a child  because harm may result to the child if he were returned home , it                             shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child, or the                             failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of this                             chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.

In all cases, the child s health ,  and                             safety , and welfare  shall be the court s  paramount  primary concern in determining whether                             reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.                                  b   i   In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a                             concurrent permanency goal.

The court is not limited to                             the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event that the primary permanency goal is                             abandoned.                                  B   If, at anytime, the court determines that reunification is no longer a child s primary                             permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section                                  a         within the earlier of    days of the court s determination or    months from the                                original removal of the child.                                  c   i   If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order                             that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and the child s parent                             for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time. In                             providing those services, the child s health ,  and safety , and welfare  shall be the division s                              paramount  primary concern, and the court shall so order.                                  ii   The court shall determine whether the services offered or provided by the division                             under the treatment plan constitute  reasonable efforts  on the part of the division.  The court                             shall also determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the treatment plan.                              Those duties and responsibilities shall be identified on the record, for the purpose of assisting                             in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with                             state and federal law.                                  iii   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the date                             that the child was initially removed from the child s home.  Nothing in this section may be                             construed to entitle any parent to an entire    months of reunification services.                                  iv   If reunification services have been ordered, the court may terminate those services                             at any time.                                  v   If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to                             be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection                                  a        , then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance                             with the permanency plan, and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the                             permanent placement of the child.                                  d   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period                             described in Subsection     c  does not interrupt the running of the period.                                  e   i   If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be                             conducted by the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time                             period for reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than                                months after the original removal of the child.                                  ii   If reunification services have not been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be                             conducted within    days, in accordance with Section         a        .                                  f   With regard to a child who is    months of age or younger at the time the child is                                initially removed from the home, the court shall                                   i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,                             pursuant to Section         a          and                                  ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                             removal of the child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to                             comply with the treatment plan.                                  g   With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have                             been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period                             of six months since the date that reunification services were ordered, the court shall terminate                             reunification services, and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental                             rights.                                      a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                             permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a                             parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  The court may determine that                             efforts to reunify a child with the child s family are not reasonable or appropriate, based on the                             individual circumstances, and that reunification services should not be provided.  In                             determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a child, and in making  reasonable                             efforts,  the child s health ,  and safety , and welfare  shall be the  paramount  primary                             concern.                                  b   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                             parent if the court finds , by clear and convincing  evidence that establishes beyond a                            reasonable doubt, that any of the following circumstances exist                                   i   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit                             indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                   ii   the parent is suffering from a mental  illness  incapacity of such magnitude that it                             renders  him  the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services  that finding shall be based                             on competent evidence from at least two mental health or medical professionals, who are not                            associates, establishing that, even with the provision of services, the parent  is unlikely to be                            capable  will be incapable of adequately caring for the child within    months                                   iii   the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or                             sexual abuse, that following the adjudication the  child  minor was removed from the custody                                of  his  the minor s parent, was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the                             minor is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse                                   iv   the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has                             committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit murder or                             manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide                                   v   the minor has suffered  severe  serious abuse by the parent or by any person known                             by the parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing                             the minor                                   vi   the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of  severe  serious abuse                             by the parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification                             services with the offending parent                                   vii   the parent s rights have been terminated with regard to any other child                                   viii   the child has been removed from  his  the child s home on at least two previous                             occasions and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times  or                                  ix   the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer   or .                                   x   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification                            efforts or services.                                       a   Failure of the parent to  respond to previous services or  comply with  any                             essential components of a previous treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the                             parent was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior directed at                            the child, whether a parent continues to live with an individual who seriously abused the child,                            or any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the child to repeated serious abuse ,                            or testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be                            successful,  shall be considered in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.                                  b   The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in                             reunification with the child, in determining whether reunification services are appropriate.                                      If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a , and the                             whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the                             minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits                             described in Subsection    , however, are not tolled by the parent s absence.                                      a   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable                                services unless it determines that those services would be seriously detrimental to the health or                            safety of the minor.

For purposes of Subsection     a , it is prima facie evidence of abandonment that a                            parent, although having legal custody of the child                                   a   has willfully surrendered physical custody of the child  and                                  b   for a period of six months following the surrender, has not manifested to the child                            or to the person having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical                            custody or to make arrangements for the care of the child.                                            The court may not terminate the parental rights of a parent because the parent                             has failed to complete the requirements of a treatment plan.                                            a   In any case in which the court has directed the division to provide                             reunification services to a parent, the court must find that the division made reasonable efforts                             to provide those services before the court may terminate the parent s rights under Subsection                                 b ,     c ,   d ,      e , or     f  , or  h  .                                  b   The court is not required to make the finding under Subsection           a  before                             terminating a parent s rights                                   i   under Subsection      b    c  based upon abuse or neglect found by the court to have                             occurred subsequent to adjudication  or                                  ii   if reasonable efforts are not required under federal law.

In determining whether a parent or parents have abandoned a child, it is prima                            facie evidence of abandonment that the parent or parents                                     a   although having legal custody of the child, have surrendered physical custody of                            the child, and for a period of six months following the surrender have not manifested to the                            child or to the person having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume                            physical custody or to make arrangements for the care of the child                                     b   have failed to communicate with the child by mail, telephone, or otherwise for six                            months                                     c   failed to have shown the normal interest of a natural parent, without just cause  o r                                   d   have abandoned an infant, as described in Section         a    .     .                                           In determining whether a parent or parents are unfit or have neglected a child the                            court shall consider, but is not limited to, the following circumstances, conduct, or conditions                                     a   emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent that renders                            him unable to care for the immediate and continuing physical or emotional needs of the child                            for extended periods of time                                        When considering evidence for grounds for terminating parental rights, the court                            shall consider the following circumstances, conduct, or conditions                                    b    a   conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or                             abusive nature                                    c    b   habitual or excessive use of intoxicating liquors, controlled substances, or                             dangerous drugs that render the parent unable to care for the child                                    d    c   repeated or continuous failure to provide the child with adequate food,                             clothing, shelter, education, or other care necessary for  his  the child s physical ,  and mental ,                            and emotional  health and development by a parent or parents who are capable of providing                             that care .  However, a parent who, legitimately practicing his religious beliefs, does not                            provide specified medical treatment for a child is not for that reason alone a negligent or unfit                            parent                                     e    d   with regard to a child who is in the custody of the division,  if  whether the                             parent is incarcerated as a result of conviction of a felony, and the sentence is of such length                             that the child will be deprived of a normal home for more than one year   or                                    f    e   a history of violent behavior .                                         If a child has been placed in the custody of the division and the parent or parents                            fail to comply substantially with the terms and conditions of a plan within six months after the                            date on which the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that                            failure to comply is evidence of failure of parental adjustment.                                        The following circumstances constitute prima facie evidence of unfitness                                     a    f   sexual abuse, injury, or death of a sibling of the child, or of any child, due to                             known or substantiated abuse or neglect by the parent or parents                                    b    g   conviction of a crime, if the facts surrounding the crime are of such a nature as                             to indicate the unfitness of the parent to provide adequate care to the extent necessary for the                             child s physical, mental, or emotional health and development                                       c    h   a single incident of life threatening or gravely disabling injury to or                             disfigurement of the child   or  and                                   d    i   the parent has committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to                             commit murder or manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide.                                      For purposes of Subsection     c , a parent who, legitimately practicing the parent s                            religious beliefs, does not provide specified medical treatment for a child is not for that reason                            alone a negligent or unfit parent.                                 Section   .    Section        a         is amended to read                                       a    .  Voluntary relinquishment    Irrevocable.

Only the juvenile court is authorized to take consents or relinquishments from a                             parent who has any child who is in the custody of a state agency or who has a child who is                             otherwise under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.                                      The court, appointed officer, or other authorized person shall certify to the best of                             that person s information and belief that the person executing the consent or relinquishment has                             read and understands the consent or relinquishment and has signed it freely and voluntarily.                                      A voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of parental rights is effective                             when it is signed and may not be revoked.                                      The requirements and processes described in Sections         a         through         a                                    do not apply to a voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of parental rights.  The                             court need only find that the relinquishment or termination is in the child s best interest.                                      There is a presumption that voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of                             parental rights is not in the child s best interest where it appears to the court that the primary                             purpose is to avoid a financial support obligation. The presumption may be rebutted, however,                             if the court finds the relinquishment or consent to termination of parental rights will facilitate                                the establishment of stability and permanency for the child.                                      Upon granting a voluntary relinquishment the court may make orders relating to the                             child s care, health, and  welfare  safety that the court considers to be in the child s best interest.
