Section                is amended to read                                        .  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody                           consideration.                                    If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is                           declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the                           minor children as it considers appropriate.                                   a   In determining any form of custody, including a change in custody, the court shall                           consider the best interests of the child without preference for either the mother or father solely                           because of the biological sex of the parent and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the                           following                                 i   the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties                                 ii   which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including                           allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent                                 iii   the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth, quality,                           and nature of the relationship between a parent and child  and                                iv   those factors outlined in Section            .     .                                b  There shall be a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody, as defined in                           Section            .     , is in the best interest of the child, except in cases where there is                                 i   domestic violence in the home or in the presence of the child                                 ii   special physical or mental needs of a parent or child, making joint legal custody                           unreasonable                                 iii   physical distance between the residences of the parents, making joint decision                           making impractical in certain circumstances  or                                iv   any other factor the court considers relevant including those listed in this section                           and Section            .     .                                c   The person who desires joint legal custody shall file a proposed parenting plan in                           accordance with Sections            .      and            .     .  A presumption for joint legal custody may                           be rebutted by a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is not in the best interest of                           the child.                                d   The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact                           determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the                           children be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.                                e   The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s                           desires regarding future custody or parent time schedules, but the expressed desires are not                              controlling and the court may determine the children s custody or parent time otherwise.  The                           desires of a child         years of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single                           controlling factor.                                f   If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection                               e , they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be                           obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only                           method to ascertain the child s desires regarding custody.                                    In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds                           relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing                           the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds                           appropriate.                                    If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court shall                           take that evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other                           parent.                                    a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , a court may not discriminate against a                           parent due to a disability, as defined in Section                , in awarding custody or determining                           whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.                                b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining                           whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody,                           the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising from the                           disability by showing that                                 i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to                           provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or                                ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources                           available to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of                           the child at issue.                                c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under                           Title   B, Chapter  , Part  , Utah Adoption Act.                                       This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint                           physical custody or sole physical custody, but allows the court and the family the widest                           discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.
