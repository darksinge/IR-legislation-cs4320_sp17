When the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction over a minor under this                           section, it also has exclusive original jurisdiction over the minor regarding all offenses joined                           with the qualifying offense, and any other offenses, including misdemeanors, arising from the                           same criminal episode.  The district court is not divested of jurisdiction by virtue of the fact                           that the minor is allowed to enter a plea to, or is found guilty of, a lesser or joined offense.                                    a   Any felony, misdemeanor, or infraction committed after the offense over which                           the district court takes jurisdiction under Subsection     or     shall be tried against the                           defendant as an adult in the district court or justice court having jurisdiction.                                b   If the qualifying charge under Subsection     results in an acquittal, a finding of not                           guilty, or a dismissal of the charge in the district court, the juvenile court under Section                             A            and the Division of Juvenile Justice Services regain any jurisdiction and authority                           previously exercised over the minor.

If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the                            state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over                            under Subsection    , the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor                            and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.
