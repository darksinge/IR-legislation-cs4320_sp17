The board shall make an order providing for the unit operation of a pool or part of                             it, if the board finds that                                   a   Such operation is reasonably necessary for the purposes of this chapter  and                                  b   The value of the estimated additional recovery of oil or gas substantially exceeds                             the estimated additional cost incident to conducting such operations.                                      The order shall prescribe a plan for unit operations that shall include                                   a   a description of the lands and of the pool or pools or parts of them to be so                             operated, termed the unit area                                   b   a statement of the nature of the operations contemplated                                   c   an allocation to the separately owned tracts in the unit area of all the oil and gas that                             is produced from the unit area and is saved, being the production that is not used in the conduct                             of operations on the unit area or not unavoidably lost. The allocation shall be in accord with the                             agreement, if any, of the interested parties. If there is no such agreement, the board shall                                determine the relative value, from evidence introduced at the hearing of the separately owned                             tracts in the unit area, exclusive of physical equipment, for development of oil and gas by unit                             operations, and the production allocated to each tract shall be the proportion that the relative                             value of each tract so determined bears to the relative value of all tracts in the unit area                                   d   a provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area  not including royalty                             owners  of their respective investment in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials,                             equipment, and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations. The                             amount to be charged unit operations for any such item shall be determined by the owners of                             the unit area  not including royalty owners   but if the owners of the unit area are unable to                             agree upon the amount or correctness, the board shall determine them. The net amount charged                             against the owner of an interest in a separately owned tract shall be considered expense of unit                             operation chargeable against his interest in the tract. The adjustments provided for may be                             treated separately and handled by agreements separate from the unitization agreement                                   e   a provision providing how the costs of unit operations, including capital                             investments, shall be determined and charged to the separately owned tracts and how these                             costs shall be paid, including a provision providing a procedure for the unit production                             allocated to an owner who does not pay the share of the cost of unit operations charged to such                             owner, or the interest of such owner, to be sold and the proceeds applied to the payment of                             such costs. The operator of the unit shall have a first and prior lien for costs incurred pursuant                             to the plan of unitization upon each owner s oil and gas rights and his share of unitized                             production to secure the payment of such owner s proportionate part of the cost of developing                             and operating the unit area.

For such purposes any nonconsenting owner shall be                             deemed to have contracted with the unit operator for his proportionate part of the cost of                             developing and operating the unit area.

No order of the board providing for unit operations of a pool or pools shall become                             effective unless and until the plan for unit operations prescribed by the division has been                             approved in writing by those owners who, under the board s order, will be required to pay                                 of the costs of the unit operation, and also by the owners of     of the production or proceeds                             that will be credited to interests which are free of cost, such as royalties, overriding royalties,                             and production payments, and the board has made a finding, either in the order providing for                             unit operations or in a supplemental order, that the plan for unit operations has been so                             approved. If the persons owning required percentage of interest in that unit area do not approve                             the plan for unit operations within a period of six months from the date on which the order                             providing for unit operations is made, the order shall be ineffective and shall be revoked by the                             board unless for good cause shown the board extends this time.                                      An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order made by the                             board in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order providing for                             unit operations, provided                                   a   If such an amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the                             approval of the amendment by the owners of royalty, overriding royalty, production payments                             and other such interests which are free of costs shall not be required.                                  b   No such order of amendment shall change the percentage for the allocation of oil                             and gas as established for any separately owned tract by the original order, or change the                             percentage for allocation of cost as established for any separately owned tract by the original                             order.                                      The board, by an order, may provide for the unit operation of a pool or pools or                                parts thereof that embrace a unit area established by a previous order of the division. The order,                             in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat the unit area previously                             established as a single tract, and the portion of the unit production allocated shall then be                             allocated among the separately owned tracts included in the previously established unit area in                             the same proportions of those specified in the previous order.                                      An order may provide for unit operations on less than the whole of a pool where the                             unit area is of such size and shape as may be reasonably required for that purpose, and the                             conduct will have no adverse effect upon other portions of the pool.                                      All operations, including, but not limited to, the commencement, drilling, or                             operation of a well upon any portion of the unit area shall be deemed for all purposes the                             conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit area by the several                             owners. The portions of the unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit area                             shall, when produced, be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such                             tract by a well drilled. Operations conducted pursuant to an order of the board providing for                             unit operations shall constitute a fulfillment of all the express or implied obligations for each                             lease or contract covering lands in the unit area to the extent that compliance with such                             obligations cannot be had because of the order of the board.                                      The portion of the unit production allocated to any tract, and the proceeds from the                             sale, shall be the property and income of the several owners, subject to the rights of royalty                             owners, to whom, or to whose credit, they are allocated or payable under the order providing                             for unit operations.                                       No division order or other contract relating to the sale or purchase of production                             from a separately owned tract shall be terminated by the order providing for unit operations but                             shall remain in force and apply to oil and gas allocated to such tract until terminated in                             accordance with the provisions thereof.                                       Except to the extent that the parties affected agree and as provided in   e  of                              Subsection     e   of this section , no order providing for unit operations shall be construed to                             result in a transfer of all or any part of the title of any person to the oil and gas rights in any                             tract in the unit area. All property, whether real or personal, that may be acquired in the                             conduct of unit operations hereunder shall be acquired for the account of the owners within the                             unit area and shall be the property of the owners in the proportion that the expenses of unit                                operations are charged, unless otherwise provided in the plan of unit operation.                                       This section shall apply only to field or pool units and shall not apply to the                             unitization of interests within a drilling unit as may be authorized and governed under the                             provisions of Section               .

Section                is amended to read                                          .  Cooperative or unit operation of geothermal area    Order    Plan of                             operation    Approval of owners    Amendment.                                      The agency or any affected person may commence an adjudicative proceeding to                             consider the need for cooperative or unit operation of a geothermal area.                                      The division shall order the cooperative or unit operation of part or all of a                             geothermal area if the division finds that                                   a   a developable resource exists  and                                     b   that this operation is reasonably necessary to prevent waste, to protect correlative                             rights, or to prevent the drilling of unnecessary wells and will not reduce the ultimate economic                             recovery of geothermal resources.                                      The division s order for cooperative or unit operations shall be upon terms and                             conditions that are just and reasonable and satisfy the requirements of Subsection    .                                      An order by the division for unit operations shall prescribe a plan, including                                   a   a description of the geothermal area to be unit operated, termed the unit area                                   b   a statement of the nature of the operations contemplated, the time they will                             commence, and the manner and circumstances under which unit operations shall terminate                                   c   an allocation to the separately owned tracts in the unit area of the geothermal                             resources produced and of the costs incurred in unit operations. The allocations shall be in                             accord with the agreement, if any, of the affected parties.  If there is no agreement, the division                             shall determine the allocations from evidence introduced at a hearing before the division.                             Production shall be allocated in proportion to the relative value that each tract bears to the                             value of all tracts in the unit area.  The acreage of each tract in proportion to the total unit                             acreage shall be the measure of relative value, unless the division finds after public hearing that                             another method is likely to result in a more equitable allocation and protection of correlative                             rights.  Resource temperature, pressure, fluid quality, geological conditions, distance to place                             of use, and productivity are among the factors that may be considered in evaluating other                             methods.  The method for allocating production in unit operations shall be revised, if, after a                             hearing, the division finds that the revised method is likely to result in a more equitable                             allocation and protection of correlative rights.   Any affected person may file a request for                             agency action to consider adoption of a revised allocation method, but the request may not be                             made until three years after the initial order by the division or at less than two year intervals                             after that.  Upon receipt of a request for consideration of a revised allocation method, the                             division shall hold a hearing                                   d   a provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area  not including royalty                             owners  of their respective investment in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials,                             equipment, and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations.  The                             amount to be charged unit operations for each item shall be determined by the owners of the                             unit area  not including royalty owners .  If the owners of the unit area are unable to agree upon                                the amount of the charges or to agree upon the correctness of the charges, any affected party                             may file a request for agency action.  Upon receipt of the request, the division shall hold a                             hearing to determine them.  The net amount charged against the owner of a separately owned                             tract shall be considered an expense of unit operation chargeable against that tract.  The                             adjustments provided for in this subsection may be treated separately and handled by                             agreements separate from the unitization agreement                                   e   a provision providing how the costs of unit operations, including capital                             investments, shall be determined and charged to the separately owned tracts and how these                             costs shall be paid, including a provision providing when, how, and by whom the unit                             production allocated to an owner who does not pay the share of the cost of unit operation                             charged to that owner, or the interest of that owner, may be sold and the proceeds applied to the                             payment of the costs.  The operator of the unit shall have a first and prior lien for costs incurred                             pursuant to the plan of unitization upon each owner s geothermal rights and his share of                             unitized production to secure the payment of the owner s proportionate part of the cost of                             developing and operating the unit area.  This lien may be  established and  enforced in the                             same manner as provided by  Sections                through                 Title   , Chapter  a, Part  ,                            Enforcement of Preconstruction and Construction Liens.  For these purposes any                             nonconsenting owner is considered to have contracted with the unit operator for his                             proportionate part of the cost of developing and operating the unit area. A transfer or                             conversion of any owner s interest or any portion of it, however accomplished, after the                             effective date of the order creating the unit, does not relieve the transferred interest of the                             operator s lien on the interest for the cost and expense of unit operations                                   f   a provision, if necessary, for carrying or otherwise financing any person who elects                             to be carried or otherwise financed, allowing a reasonable interest charge for this service                             payable out of that person s share of the production                                   g   a provision for the supervision and conduct of the unit operations, in respect to                             which each person shall have a vote with a value corresponding to the percentage of the costs                             of unit operations chargeable against the interest of that person                                   h   any additional provisions that are necessary to carry on the unit operations.                                      a   No order of the division providing for unit operations is effective unless and                             until the division finds that the plan for unit operations prescribed by the division has been                                approved in writing by                                   i   those persons, who under the division s order, will be required to pay     of the                             costs of the unit operation  and                                  ii   the owners of     of the production or proceeds of the unit operation that are free                             of costs, such as royalties, overriding royalties, and production payments.                                  b   If the persons owning the required percentage of interest in the unit area do not                             approve the plan within six months from the date on which the order is made, the order is                             ineffective and shall be revoked by the division unless for good cause shown the division                             extends this time.                                      a   An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order of the                             division in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order for unit                             operations.                                  b   If this amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the approval                             of the amendment by the owners of royalty, overriding royalty, production payments, and other                             interests that are free of costs is required.                                  c   Production allocation may be amended only by following the procedures of                             Subsection     c .                                      a   All operations, including the commencement, drilling, or operation of a well                             upon any portion of the unit area are considered for all purposes to be the conduct of those                             operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit by the several owners of tracts in the                             unit.                                  b   The portions of the unit production allocated to a separately owned tract in a unit                             area are, when produced, considered for all purposes to have been actually produced from that                             tract by a well drilled on it.
