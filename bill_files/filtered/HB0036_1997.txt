The certified tax rate shall be         calculated by dividing property tax revenues collected for the prior year by that taxing entity          excluding collections from redemptions, interest, and penalties by the taxable value established          in accordance with Section          except for the following                i   except as provided in Subsection     a  ii , for new taxing entities the certified tax rate           is zero                ii   for each municipality incorporated on or after July  ,     , the certified tax rate is                A   in a county of the first, second, or third class, the levy imposed for municipal type          services under Sections         and          and               B   in a county of the fourth, fifth, or sixth class, the levy imposed for general county          purposes and such other levies imposed solely for the municipal type services identified in Section                  and Subsection                           iii   for debt service voted on by the public, the certified tax rate shall be the actual levy          imposed by that section  however,               iv   the exceptions for the levies granted in Subsection     a  iii  do not include                A   school leeways provided for under Sections       ,   A       ,   A   a    ,            A   a    ,   A   a    ,   A   a    ,   A   a    , and   A         and               B   levies to pay for the costs of state legislative mandates or judicial or administrative          orders under Section         .   and               v   the certified tax rates for the levies listed in Subsection     a  iv  shall each be          calculated in accordance with Section         .               b   For the purpose of calculating the certified tax rate, the county auditor shall use the          taxable value of property on the assessment roll, exclusive of new growth.
