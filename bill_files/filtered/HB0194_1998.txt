of the hearing at least             days before the hearing.               d   A failure of the municipal legislative body to adopt a resolution under Subsection              a  within the time allowed under Subsection     b  shall be considered a rejection of the          petition.                   a   A withdrawal under this section may not occur unless the withdrawal has been          approved by a majority vote of registered voters residing within the area proposed to be withdrawn          and voting at a special or municipal election held for that purpose after the adoption of a resolution          under Subsection     a  but within six months of the adoption.               b   Each election under Subsection     a  shall be held by the municipality in which the          area

consultants provided by the Utah Association of Certified          Public Accountants.               ii   The municipal legislative body and the governing body of the improvement district          shall obtain the lists described in Subsection     c  i  within    days of the election under          Subsection    .               iii   Within    days of receiving the lists described in Subsection     c  i , the governing          body of the improvement district shall eliminate the name of one engineering consultant from the          list of engineering consultants and the name of one accounting consultant from the list of          accounting consultants and shall notify the municipal legislative body in writing of the          eliminations.               iv   Within three days of

and another name of an accounting consultant from the list of accounting          consultants and shall notify the governing body of the improvement district in writing of the          eliminations.               v   The governing body of the improvement district and the municipal legislative body          shall continue to alternate between them, each eliminating the name of one engineering consultant                 from the list of engineering consultants and the name of one accounting consultant from the list         of accounting consultants and providing written notification of the eliminations within three days         of receiving notification of the previous notifications, until the name of only one engineering         consultant remains on the list of engineering consultants and the name of only one accounting         consultant remains on the list of accounting consultants.                  a   i   Subject to Subsections     a  ii  and  iii , the engineering consultant shall         allocate the improvement district assets between the improvement district and the municipality.              ii   The engineer shall allocate               A   to the improvement district those assets reasonably needed by the improvement district          to provide to the area of the district remaining after withdrawal the kind and quality of service          provided before withdrawal  and               B   to the municipality those assets reasonably needed by the municipality to provide to          the withdrawn area the kind and quality of service provided before withdrawal.               iii   If the engineer determines that both the improvement district and the municipality          reasonably need an improvement district asset to provide to their respective areas the kind and          quality of service provided before withdrawal, the engineer shall                A   allocate the asset between the improvement district and municipality according to their          relative needs, if the asset is reasonably susceptible of division  or               B   allocate the asset to the improvement district, if the asset is not reasonably susceptible          of division.               b   i   The accounting consultant shall determine                A   subject to Subsection     b  ii , the proposed withdrawn area s proportionate share of          the improvement district s outstanding revenue and general obligation bonds  and               B   subject to Subsection     b  iii , fair and reasonable terms and conditions pursuant to          which the municipality shall pay the amounts determined under Subsection     b  i  A .               ii   For purposes of Subsection     b  i  A                 A   the proposed withdrawn area s proportionate share of revenue bonds shall be          determined by dividing the number of water connections on the property within the withdrawn area          immediately before withdrawal by the number of water connections on all property within the          improvement district immediately before withdrawal  and               B   the proposed withdrawn area s proportionate share of general obligation bonds shall                 be determined by dividing the assessed value of taxable property within the withdrawn area         immediately before withdrawal by the assessed value of all taxable property within the         improvement district immediately before withdrawal.              iii   The amount to be paid by the municipality to the improvement district and the timing         of those payments, as determined by the accounting consultant under Subsection     b  i  B , shall         be sufficient to pay the withdrawn area s proportionate share of the total amount needed to prevent         a default in the payment of principal and interest on improvement district revenue and general         obligation bonds outstanding at the time of withdrawal.              c   i   The engineering and accounting consultants shall cooperate and collaborate together          and share information and expertise to assist each other to fulfill the duties and responsibilities          provided in Subsections     a  and  b .               ii   The officers and employees of each improvement district and municipality involved          in a proposed withdrawal under this section shall cooperate fully with the engineering and          accounting consultants and shall provide them the information they request in connection with          fulfilling their duties and responsibilities under Subsections     a  and  b .               d   i   Except as provided in Subsection     d  ii , the improvement district and the          municipality shall equally share the cost of the engineering and accounting consultants.               ii   Notwithstanding Subsection     d  i , the municipality shall pay the full cost of the          engineering and accounting consultants if the municipal legislative body rejects the withdrawal          under Subsection     a .                   a   i   Within    days after receiving the written communication from the engineering          and accounting consultants providing the information required by Subsection    , the municipal          legislative body shall adopt a resolution either approving or rejecting the withdrawal.               ii   Each resolution under Subsection     a  i  approving a withdrawal shall include a map          or plat that accurately delineates by metes and bounds the withdrawn area.               iii   The municipal legislative body s failure to adopt a resolution under Subsection              a  i  shall be considered a rejection of the withdrawal.               b   Within three days of adopting a resolution under Subsection     a  i , the municipal          legislative body shall send a certified copy of the resolution to the governing body of the          improvement district.               c   Each municipal legislative body adopting a resolution under Subsection     a                  approving the withdrawal shall               i   cause a certified copy of the resolution to be recorded in the office of the recorder of         the county in which the withdrawn area is located  and              ii   send written notification of the withdrawal to the State Tax Commission, including a         certified copy of the resolution approving the withdrawal and evidence that the resolution has been         recorded by the county recorder.              d   Upon the recording of the resolution in the county recorder s office under Subsection             c  i  and notification to the State Tax Commission under Subsection     c  ii , the withdrawal         shall be complete, and the withdrawn area shall cease to be part of the improvement district.
