and any decision                             made after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made                             after a hearing before the full membership of the division.                                  iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,                             extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.                                  b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications

incompetent to drive a motor vehicle                                      iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities that might make him dangerous                             on the highways  or                                  iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to drive a motor vehicle safely.                                      a   Subject to Subsection     d , the division shall suspend a person s license when                             the division receives notice from the Office of Recovery Services that the Office of Recovery                             Services has ordered the suspension of the person s license.                                  b   A suspension under Subsection     a  shall remain in effect until the division                             receives notice from the Office of Recovery Services that the Office of Recovery Services has                             rescinded the order of suspension.                                  c   After an order of suspension is rescinded under Subsection     b , a report                             authorized by Section                  may not contain any evidence of the suspension.                                  d   i   If the division suspends a person s license under this Subsection    , the division                             shall, upon application, issue a temporary limited driver license to the person if that person                             needs a driver license for employment, education, or child visitation.                                  ii   The temporary limited driver license described in this section                                   A   shall provide that the person may operate a motor vehicle only for the purpose of

than a                             purpose described in Subsection     d  ii  A   and                                  C   shall expire    days after the day on which the temporary limited driver license is                             issued.                                  iii   A   During the period beginning on the day on which a temporary limited driver                             license is issued under this Subsection    , and ending on the day that the temporary limited                             driver license expires, the suspension described in this Subsection     only applies if the person                             who is suspended operates a motor vehicle for a purpose other than employment, education, or                             child visitation.                                  B   Upon expiration of a temporary limited driver license described in this Subsection                                 d                                    I   a suspension described in Subsection     a  shall be in full effect until the division                             receives notice, under Subsection     b , that the order of suspension is rescinded  and                                  II   a person suspended under Subsection     a  may not drive a motor vehicle for any                                reason.                                  iv   The division is not required to issue a limited driver license to a person under this                             Subsection     d  if there are other legal grounds for the suspension of the person s driver                             license.                                  v   The division shall make rules, in accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah                             Administrative Rulemaking Act, to implement the provisions of this part.                                      a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state                             upon receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed                             there that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a                             license.                                  b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                             nonresident driver of a motor

                state where the person convicted is a resident.                                      a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a                             motor vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be                             suspended or revoked.                                  b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when the person s                             license has been suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                                      a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of                             more than one year except                                   i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                                       ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges                             under Section                                                    iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports                             under Subsection                                                       iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section                                   a          or                                  v   when the division suspends the license under Subsection    .                                  b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until the                             person shows satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                                          a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                             Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any                             person without hearing and without receiving a record of the person s conviction for a crime                             when the division has reason to believe that the person s license was granted by the division                             through error or fraud or that the necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is                             terminated.                                  b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that                             after the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                       a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is                             incompetent or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified                             by the  division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                  b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                             person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction                             imposed in accordance with Section                 .                                  c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                             suspension or revocation of the licensee s license.                                       a  Except as provided in Subsection      b , a report authorized by Section                                           may not contain any evidence of a conviction for speeding on an interstate system in                             this state if the conviction was for a speed of ten miles per hour or less, above the posted speed                             limit and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in a manner specified by the division                             by the individual whose report is being requested.                                  b   The provisions of Subsection      a  do not apply for                                   i   a CDL license holder  or                                  ii   a violation that occurred in a commercial motor vehicle.                                       a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                             Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person                             if it has reason to believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is                             required under Title   , Chapter   a, Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Owners and                             Operators Act, and has driven the motor vehicle or permitted it to be driven within this state                             without the security being in effect.                                   b   The division may immediately suspend a driving privilege card holder s driving                               privilege card if the division receives notification from the Motor Vehicle Division that                                     i   the driving privilege card holder is the registered owner of a vehicle  and                                    ii   the driving privilege card holder s vehicle registration has been revoked under                            Subsection         a            a  ii  A .                                    c    b   Section          a         regarding the requirement of proof of owner s or operator s                             security applies to persons whose driving privileges are suspended under this Subsection     .                                   d    c   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this                             Subsection     , the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.                                   e    d   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has                             been revoked by the division under this Subsection      may file a request for agency action                             requesting a hearing.                                       Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also                             disqualifies any license issued to that person under Part  , Uniform Commercial Driver License                             Act, of this chapter.
