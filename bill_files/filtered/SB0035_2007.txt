The order must include the provisions required bySubsection     and measures and conditions, including those in Subsections    ,    , and    ,that are reasonably calculated to prevent abduction of the child, giving due consideration to thecustody, visitation, and parent time rights of the parties.

Section    a, with respect to anydocument, application, or other information pertaining to the child authorizing its disclosure tothe court and the petitioner  and f   upon the petitioner s request, a requirement that the respondent obtain an order fromthe relevant foreign country containing terms identical to the child custody determinationissued in the United States.

To prevent imminent abduction of a child, a court may  a   issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child under Section                   or thelaw of this state other than this chapter  b   direct the use of law enforcement to take any action reasonably necessary to locatethe child, obtain return of the child, or enforce a custody determination under this chapter orthe law of this state other than this chapter  or c   grant any other relief allowed under the law of this state other than this chapter.     The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not affect theavailability of other remedies to prevent abduction.             .     If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there isa credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issuean ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.     The respondent on a petition under Subsection     must be afforded an opportunityto be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later thanthe next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible.  In that event, the court shallhold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.     An ex parte warrant under Subsection     to take physical custody of a child must  a   recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongfulremoval of the child is based  b   direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately  c   state the date and time for the hearing on the petition  and d   provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of thecourt.     If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of thechild after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of theNational Crime Information Center system and similar state databases to determine if either thepetitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.     The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediatelyafter the child is taken into physical custody.     A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, isenforceable throughout this state.  If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not beeffective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physicalcustody of the child.  If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize lawenforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.     If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant underSubsection     for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award therespondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and other reasonable expenses and losses arising outof the issuance of the ex parte warrant.     This chapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under the law of thisstate other than this chapter.             .An abduction prevention order remains in effect until the earliest of      the time stated in the order      the emancipation of the child      the child s attaining    years of age  or     the time the order is modified, revoked, vacated, or superseded by a court withjurisdiction under Sections          c         through          c        .             .This chapter is a uniform act.

Section                  is enacted to read                                          .   Warrant to take physical custody of child.                                     If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there is                           a credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue                           an ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.                                     The respondent on a petition under Subsection     must be afforded an opportunity                           to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than                           the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible.  In that event, the court shall                           hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.                                     An ex parte warrant under Subsection     to take physical custody of a child must                                  a   recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful                           removal of the child is based                                  b   direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately                                  c   state the date and time for the hearing on the petition  and                                 d   provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the                           court.                                     If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of the                           child after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the                           National Crime Information Center system and similar state databases to determine if either the                           petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.                                     The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediately                           after the child is taken into physical custody.                                     A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is                           enforceable throughout this state.  If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be                              effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical                           custody of the child.  If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law                           enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.                                     If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under                           Subsection     for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the                           respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and other reasonable expenses and losses arising out                           of the issuance of the ex parte warrant.                                     This chapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under the law of this                           state other than this chapter.                                Section   .
