Emissions fees  accrued on and after July  ,     , but before issuance of an        operating permit, shall be based on the most recent emissions inventory, unless a source elects        before July  ,     , to base the fee on allowable emissions, if applicable for a regulated        pollutant.      After an operating permit is issued the emissions fee  shall be based on actual        emissions for a regulated pollutant unless a source elects, prior to the issuance or renewal of a        permit, to base the fee during the period of the permit on allowable emissions for that regulated        pollutant.
