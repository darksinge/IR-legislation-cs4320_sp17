                               g   With regard to a minor who is    months of age or younger at the time the minor is                            initially removed from the home, the court shall                                  i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,                            pursuant to Section       A            and                                 ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                            removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                            to comply with the child and family plan.                                 h   With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are                            ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six                            months from the date that reunification services were ordered                                  i   the court shall terminate reunification services  and                                 ii   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.                                 i   When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section       A          ,                           the court shall attempt to keep the minor s sibling group together if keeping the sibling group                           together is                                  i   practicable  and                                 ii   in accordance with the best interest of the minor.                                     a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                            permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a                               parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.                                 b   The court may determine that                                  i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate,                            based on the individual circumstances  and                                 ii   reunification services should not be provided.                                 c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor, and in                            making  reasonable efforts,  the minor s health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount                            concern.                                 d   i   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                            parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following                            circumstances exist                                  A   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit                            indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                  B   subject to Subsection     d  ii , the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such                            magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                  C   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,                            sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor                                  I   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent                                  II   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and                                 III   is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual                            exploitation                                  D   the parent                                  I   caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect  or                                 II   committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit

person known by the                            parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the                            minor                                  F   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,                            and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the                               offending parent                                  G   the parent s rights are terminated with regard to any other minor                                  H   the minor is removed from the minor s home on at least two previous occasions                            and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times                                  I   the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer                                  J   the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a                            location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation                            was located  or                                 K   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification                            efforts or services.                                 ii   The finding under Subsection     d  i  B  shall be based on competent evidence                            from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing                            that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately                            caring for the minor within    months from the day on which the court finding is made.                                     In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take                            into consideration                                  a   failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child                            and family plan                                  b   the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of                            drugs or alcohol                                  c   any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family                            member                                  d   whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor                                  e   any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse                                  f   testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be                            successful  and                                 g   whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.                                     a   If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a , and the                            whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the                            minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.                                 b   The time limits described in Subsection     are not tolled by the parent s absence.                                        a   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable                            services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.                                  b   In making the determination described in Subsection     a , the court shall                            consider                                  i   the age of the minor                                  ii   the degree of parent child bonding                                  iii   the length of the sentence                                  iv   the nature of the treatment                                  v   the nature of the crime or illness                                  vi   the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered                                  vii   for a minor ten years of age or older, the minor s attitude toward the                            implementation of family reunification services  and                                 viii   any other appropriate factors.                                 c   Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the    month                            limitation imposed in Subsection    .                                 d   Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the    month                            limitation imposed in Subsection    , unless the court determines that continued reunification                            services would be in the minor s best interest.
