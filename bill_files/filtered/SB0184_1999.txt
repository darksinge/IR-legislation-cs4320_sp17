This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                       AMENDS                             A       , as last amended by Chapters     and    , Laws of Utah                          Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                           Section  .    Section      A            is amended to read                              A       .  Motor vehicle liability coverage.                               a   In addition to complying with the requirements of Chapter    and Part II of Chapter                        , a policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection       A               a  shall                            i   name the motor vehicle owner or operator in whose name the policy was purchased,                      state that named insured s address, the coverage afforded, the premium charged, the policy period,                      and the limits of liability                            ii   A   if it is an owner s policy, designate by appropriate reference all the motor vehicles                      on which coverage is granted, insure the person named in the policy, insure any other person using                      any named motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured, and, except                      as provided in Subsection    , insure any person included in

within the United States and Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and                      costs, for each motor vehicle, in amounts not less than the minimum limits specified under Section

upon him by law for damages arising out of the insured s use of any motor                      vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and with the same limits of liability                      as in an owner s policy under Subsection     ii  A                              iii   except as provided in Subsection    , insure persons related to the named insured by

temporarily live elsewhere,                      to the same extent as the named insured and the available coverage of the policy may not be reduced                     to the persons described in this Subsection     a  iii  because                            A   a permissive user driving a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident  or                           B   the named insured or any of the persons described in this Subsection     a  iii  driving                     a covered motor vehicle is at fault in causing an accident  and                           iv   cover damages or injury resulting from a covered driver of a motor vehicle who is                      stricken by an unforeseeable paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition and who is not                      reasonably aware that paralysis, seizure, or other unconscious condition is about to occur to the                      extent that a person of ordinary prudence would not attempt to continue driving.                           b   The driver s liability under Subsection     a  iv  is limited to the insurance coverage.                               a   A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection                         A               a  may                            i   provide for the prorating of the insurance under that policy with other valid and                      collectible insurance                            ii   grant any lawful coverage in addition to the required motor vehicle liability coverage                            iii   if the policy is issued to a person other than a motor vehicle business, limit the coverage                      afforded to a motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits                      under Section       A           , and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible                      insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or contingent                       and                           iv   if issued to a motor vehicle business, restrict coverage afforded to anyone other than the                      motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits under Section                         A           , and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible insurance with at                      least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or contingent.                           b   i   The liability insurance coverage of a permissive user of a motor vehicle owned by a                              motor vehicle business shall be primary coverage.                           ii   The liability insurance coverage of a motor vehicle business shall be secondary to the                      liability insurance coverage of a permissive user as specified under Subsection     b  i .                               Motor vehicle liability coverage need not insure any liability                            a   under any workers  compensation law under Title   A                            b   resulting from bodily injury to or death of an employee of the named insured, other than                      a domestic employee, while engaged in the employment of the insured, or while engaged in the                      operation, maintenance, or repair of a designated vehicle  or                           c   resulting from damage to property owned by, rented to, bailed to, or transported by the                      insured.                               An insurance carrier providing motor vehicle liability coverage has the right to settle any                      claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of the settlement                      is deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section       A           .                               A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage imposes on the insurer the duty to                      defend, in good faith, any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit seeking damages                      which would be payable under the policy.                               a   If a policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage provides an insurer with the                      defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured, that defense is not effective against a third                      person making a claim against the insurer, unless there was collusion between the third person and                      the insured.                           b   If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant, after payment,                      the insurer is subrogated to the injured person s claim against the insured to the extent of the payment                      and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has been made whole                      with respect to the claim against the insured.                               A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection       A               may                      specifically exclude from coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured s household,                      including a person who usually makes his home in the same household but temporarily lives                      elsewhere, if each person excluded from coverage satisfies the owner s or operator s security                              requirement of Section          a        , independently of the named insured s proof of owner s or                      operator s security.                               A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage may limit coverage to the policy minimum                     limits under Section       A            if the insured motor vehicle is operated by a person who has                     consumed any alcohol or any illegal drug or illegal substance if the policy or a specifically reduced                     premium was extended to the insured upon express written declaration executed by the insured that                     the insured motor vehicle would not be so operated.
