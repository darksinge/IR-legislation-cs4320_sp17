This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                            AMENDS                                        , as renumbered and amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .    Section                 is amended to read                                         .  Diversion    Procedure.                                    As used in this section,  diversion  means suspending action to discipline a licensee                           charged with certain offenses within the category of unprofessional conduct on the condition that                           the licensee  agrees to participate in an educational or rehabilitation program or fulfill some other                           condition.                                    a   The director may establish, as circumstances require, a diversion advisory                           committee for each occupation or profession or similar groups of occupations or professions                           licensed by the division.  The committees shall assist the director in the administration of this                           section.                                b   Each committee shall consist of three or more licensees from the same or similar                           occupation or profession as the person whose conduct is the subject of the committee s                           consideration.  The members of a diversion advisory committee shall be  nominated  appointed                             by the director from nominations submitted by the corresponding board established for the same                          or similar occupation or profession under Section                or from other qualified nominees                          developed by or submitted to the division.  Committee members may not serve concurrently as                           members of the corresponding board. Committee members shall serve voluntarily without                           remuneration.  The director may dissolve any diversion advisory committee, remove or request the                           replacement of any member of a committee, and establish any procedure that is necessary and                           proper for a committee s administration.                                    The director may, after consultation with the appropriate diversion advisory committee                           and by written agreement with the licensee, divert the licensee to a diversion program, at any time                           after receipt of a complaint, prior to notifying a licensee that formal disciplinary action for                           unprofessional conduct is being considered against the licensee, or prior to the conclusion of a                           hearing under Section                 .                                    The division shall define by rule the particular offenses within the category of                           unprofessional conduct which may be subject to diversion. A licensee may be eligible for a                           diversion program only once for the same or similar offense and is not eligible if previously                           disciplined by the division, by a licensing agency of another state, or by a federal government                           agency for the same or a similar offense.  Diversion programs may not be longer than  two  five                           years.  A decision by the director not to divert a licensee is not subject to appeal or judicial review.                                    A licensee may be represented by counsel during the negotiations for diversion, at the                           time of the execution of the diversion agreement, and at any hearing before the director relating                           to a diversion program.                                    Any diversion agreement entered into between the division and the licensee shall                           contain a full detailed statement of the requirements agreed to by the licensee and the reasons for                           diversion.                                    A diversion agreement may not be approved unless the licensee in the agreement                           knowingly and intelligently waives the right to a hearing under Section                 .                                    The director shall dismiss the charges against a licensee who has completed the                           requirements of his diversion agreement.  The licensee may not thereafter be subject to disciplinary                           action for the conduct involved.                                    Diversion is not a determination that charges have been proven. If the charges are                           dismissed following diversion, the matter shall be treated as if the charge had never been filed,                              except the fact that a licensee has completed a diversion program and the terms and conditions of                           the diversion program may be considered by the division in determining appropriate disciplinary                           action to be taken in the event the licensee is charged in the future with the same or a similar                           offense.  No reporting or release of information regarding the diversion program of an individual                           licensee or the fact that charges were filed may be made to anyone outside the division.  The                           licensee may not be required to report to any person, agency, or corporation the fact that he has                           been subject to a diversion program if the licensee successfully completes the diversion program.                            Negotiations or hearings regarding diversion may not be subject to the requirements of Title   ,                           Chapter  , Open and Public Meetings.                                     If, during the course of the diversion of a licensee, information is brought to the                           attention of the director that the licensee has violated the diversion agreement, and if it appears in                           the best interest of the public to proceed with the charges, the director after consultation with the                           diversion advisory committee, shall cause to be served on the licensee an order to show cause                           specifying the facts relied upon by the director to terminate diversion and which sets a time and                           place for a hearing to determine whether or not the licensee has violated the diversion agreement.                           If, after the hearing, the director finds that the licensee has failed to comply with any terms or                           conditions of the diversion agreement, the director shall proceed with the charges against the                           licensee which resulted in the diversion agreement plus any additional charges of unprofessional                           conduct arising from a violation of the diversion agreement.                                     The administrative statute of limitations for taking disciplinary action described in                          Subsection                     shall be tolled during a diversion program.
