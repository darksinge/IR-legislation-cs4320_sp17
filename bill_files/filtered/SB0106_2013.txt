Determination of contribution rates.                                    a   An employer s basic contribution rate is the same as the employer s benefit ratio                           and is determined by dividing the total benefit costs charged back to an employer during the                           immediately preceding four fiscal years by the total taxable wages of the employer for the same                              time period, calculated to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction.                                b   In calculating the basic contribution rate under Subsection     a , if four fiscal years                           of data are not available                                 i   the data of the number of complete fiscal years that is available shall be divided by                           the total taxable wages for the same time period  or                                ii   if the employer is a new employer, the basic contribution rate shall be determined                           as described in Subsection    .                                    a   Subject to Subsection     b , the division shall determine the social contribution                           rate by dividing all social costs as defined in Subsection       A              applicable to the                           preceding four fiscal years by the total taxable wages of all employers subject to contributions                           for the same period, calculated to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction, and                           rounding the result to three decimal places as follows                                 i   if the fourth decimal place is four or less, the third decimal place does not change                            or                                ii   if the fourth decimal place is five or more, rounding the third decimal place up.                                b   For calendar  year  years      and      only, if the calculation of the social                           contribution rate under Subsection     a  is greater than  .      .   , the social contribution                           rate for that calendar year        is  .      .   .                                    a  The division shall set the reserve factor at a rate that sustains an adequate                           reserve.                                b   For the purpose of setting the reserve factor                                 i  the adequate reserve is defined as between    and    months of benefits at the                           average of the five highest benefit cost rates in the last    years                                 ii   the division shall set the reserve factor at  .     if the actual reserve fund balance                           as of June    preceding the computation date is determined to be an adequate reserve                                 iii   the division shall set the reserve factor between  .     and  .     if the actual                           reserve fund balance as of June    preceding the computation date is greater than the adequate                           reserve                                    iv   the division shall set the reserve factor between  .     and  .     if the actual                           reserve fund balance as of June    prior to the computation date is less than the adequate                           reserve                                 v   if the actual reserve fund balance as of June    preceding the computation date is                           insolvent or negative or if there is an outstanding loan from the Federal Unemployment                           Account or other lending institution, the division shall set the reserve factor at  .     until the                           actual reserve fund balance as of June    preceding the computation date is determined by the                           division to be solvent or positive and there is no outstanding loan                                 vi   the division shall set the reserve factor on or before January   of each year  and                                vii   money made available to the state under Section     of the Social Security Act,                              U.S.C.     , as amended, which is received on or after January  ,     , may not be                           considered in establishing the reserve factor under this section for the rate year      or any                           following rate year.                                    a   Beginning January  ,     , an employer s overall contribution rate is                                 i   except as provided in Subsection     a  ii  or  iii , the employer s basic contribution                           rate multiplied by the reserve factor established under Subsection     b , calculated to four                           decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction, plus the social contribution rate                           established under Subsection    , and the result calculated to three decimal places, disregarding                           any remaining fraction                                 ii   if under Subsection     a  i , the overall contribution rate calculation for an                           employer is greater than    plus the applicable social contribution rate, the overall                           contribution rate for the employer shall be reduced to    plus the applicable social                           contribution rate  or                                iii   if under Subsection     a  i , the overall contribution rate calculation for a new                           employer is less than  .  , the overall contribution rate for the new employer shall be                           increased to  .  .                                b   Beginning January  ,     , an employer s overall contribution rate is                                 i   except as provided in Subsection     b  ii  or  iii , the employer s basic contribution                              rate multiplied by the reserve factor established under Subsection     b , calculated to four                           decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction, plus the social contribution rate                           established under Subsection    , and the result calculated to three decimal places, disregarding                           any remaining fraction                                 ii   if under Subsection     b  i , the overall contribution rate calculation for an                           employer is greater than    plus the applicable social contribution rate, the overall                           contribution rate for the employer shall be reduced to    plus the applicable social                           contribution rate  or                                iii   if under Subsection     b  i , the overall contribution rate

           c   The overall contribution rate described under this Subsection     does not include                           the addition of any penalty applicable to an employer                                 i   as a result of delinquency in the payment of contributions as provided in Subsection                                 or                                 ii   that is assessed a penalty

employer is based on the average benefit cost rate experienced by employers of the major                            industry, as defined by department rule, to which the new employer belongs.                                 b   Except as provided in Subsection     c , by January   of each year, the basic                            contribution rate to be used in computing a new employer s overall contribution rate under                            Subsection     is the benefit cost rate that is the greater of                                  i   the amount calculated by dividing the total benefit costs charged back to both active                            and inactive employers of the same major industry for the last two fiscal years by the total                            taxable wages paid by those employers that were paid during the same time period, computed                            to four decimal places, disregarding any remaining fraction  or                                 ii     .                                 c   If the major industrial classification assigned to a new employer is an industry for                               which a benefit cost rate does not exist because the industry has not operated in the state or has                            not been covered under this chapter, the employer s basic contribution rate is  .  .  This basic                            contribution rate is used in computing the employer s overall contribution rate under                            Subsection    .                                     Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and except as provided in                            Subsection    , if an employing unit that moves into this state is declared to be a qualified                            employer because it has sufficient payroll and benefit cost experience under another state, a                            rate shall be computed on the same basis as a rate is computed for all other employers subject                            to this chapter if that unit furnishes adequate records on which to compute the rate.                                     An employer who begins to operate in this state after having operated in another                            state shall be assigned the maximum overall contribution rate until the employer acquires                            sufficient experience in this state to be considered a  qualified employer  if the employer is                                  a   regularly engaged as a contractor in the construction, improvement, or repair of                            buildings, roads, or other structures on lands                                  b   generally regarded as being a construction

shall be divested of the transferring employer s                            unemployment experience provided the transferring employer had discontinued operations, but                            only to the extent as defined under Subsection       A              c   and                                 iii   if an employer transfers its trade or business, or a portion of its trade or business,                            as defined under Subsection       A             , the transferring employer may not be divested of its                            employer s unemployment experience.                                 b  An employing unit or prospective employing unit that acquires the unemployment                            experience of an employer shall, for all purposes of this chapter, be an

                 Subsection     a , is divested of the employer s unemployment experience by transferring all of                            the employer s business to another and by ceasing operations as of the date of the transfer, the                            transferring employer shall cease to be an employer, as defined by this chapter, as of the date of                            transfer.                                     a  A rate of less than the maximum overall contribution rate is effective only for                            new employers and to those qualified employers who, except for amounts due under division                            determinations that have not become final, paid all contributions prescribed by the division for                            the four consecutive calendar quarters in the fiscal year immediately preceding the computation                            date.                                 b   Notwithstanding Subsections    ,    ,    , and    , an employer who fails to pay all                            contributions prescribed by the division for the four consecutive calendar quarters in the fiscal                            year immediately preceding the computation date, except for amounts due under                            determinations that have not become final, shall pay a contribution rate equal to the overall                            contribution rate determined under the experience rating provisions of this chapter, plus a                            surcharge of    of wages.                                 c   An employer who pays all required contributions shall, for the current contribution                            year, be assigned a rate based upon the employer s own experience as provided under the                            experience rating provisions of this chapter effective the first day of the calendar quarter in                               which the payment was made.
