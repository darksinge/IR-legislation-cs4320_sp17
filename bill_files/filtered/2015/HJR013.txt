for decision making             WHEREAS  accounting standard setting bodies  such as the Financial Accounting       Standards Board  set generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  so that investors        policymakers  citizens  and others can have access to relevant and reliable financial       information             WHEREAS  management of public companies must follow GAAP in order to maintain       the confidence of investors as well as avoid regulatory entanglements  legal liability  and       criminal prosecution             WHEREAS  when entities or individuals have deviated from GAAP  the results have       brought about disastrous consequences for corporations and individual investors             WHEREAS  for example  when Enron Corporation failed  thousands of people lost       their jobs and thousands of investors collectively lost billions of dollars             WHEREAS  Enron was liable for billions of dollars in obligations that were not       reported on its balance sheet as liabilities  which made it difficult for analysts and investors to       clearly understand the true picture of Enron s financial position prior to its collapse             WHEREAS  GAAP requires that a public company reports its obligations as a liability       on its balance sheet             WHEREAS  in particular  GAAP requires that estimated retirement benefits be       recognized as a liability on the balance sheet             WHEREAS  companies that have obligations to pay their current and former employees       for health care and retirement benefits are required to recognize and report these obligations as       a liability on their balance sheet             WHEREAS  the United States government has an obligation to pay citizens  future       retirement benefits and health care benefits  primarily through Social Security and Medicare             WHEREAS  United States taxpayers are rightfully entitled to these benefits because       taxpayers regularly contribute Social Security and Medicare premiums to the federal       government through payroll deductions             WHEREAS  the United States government does not currently include most of its       obligations for retirement and health care benefits as liabilities in its financial statements             WHEREAS  the amount of reported federal debt is staggering             WHEREAS  as of the end of fiscal year       total reported liabilities of the United       States  including debt held by the public and debt held by the United States government  were       over     trillion             WHEREAS  noted professor and accountant Robert D  Allen  Ph D   writing for the       Journal of Accounting Education in       observed that  it took more than     years   from       the

the amount of unreported federal debt is even more staggering             WHEREAS  estimates of total federal debt  including unreported liabilities  are at least           trillion             WHEREAS  according to some studies  the total federal debt  including unreported       liabilities  is more than      trillion             WHEREAS  the United States Government Accountability Office predicts that the       amount of federal debt  both reported and unreported  will continue to increase over the next       two decades as the baby boomer generation continues to retire             WHEREAS  formally recognizing unrecorded liabilities is an important step that will       help Congress and the public to better understand the extent of the problems associated with       the national debt and deficit spending  and            WHEREAS  formally recognizing these liabilities as part of the national debt will also       place Congress and the public in a better position to evaluate spending priorities and make       equitable spending decisions in the future             NOW  THEREFORE  BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah       strongly urges the
