availability of water from the source of supply for the       existing right  or             C   enlarging the quantity of water depleted by the nature of the proposed use when       compared with the nature of the currently approved use              ii    Quantity impairment  does not mean a decrease in the static level of water in an       underground basin or aquifer that would result from an action proposed to be taken in a change       application  if the volume of water necessary to satisfy an existing right otherwise remains       reasonably available               b    c    Temporary

before the state engineer  the applicant has the burden of producing        evidence sufficient to support a reasonable belief that the change can be made in compliance        with this section and Section         including evidence               a   that the change will not cause a specific existing right to experience quantity        impairment  or              b   if applicable  rebutting the presumption of quantity impairment described in        Subsection           c                 b        A change of an approved application to appropriate water does not                i    a   affect

believe that               i   for an application to appropriate  there is unappropriated water in the proposed        source               ii   the proposed use will not impair existing rights or interfere with the more        beneficial use of the water               iii   the proposed plan               A   is physically and economically feasible  unless the application is filed by the        United States Bureau of Reclamation     and              B   would not prove detrimental to the public welfare               iv   the applicant has the financial ability to complete the proposed

state engineer s own investigation or otherwise  has reason to believe that        an application  to appropriate water  will interfere with  its  the water s more beneficial use for        irrigation  municipal and industrial  domestic or culinary  stock watering  power or mining        development  or manufacturing  or will unreasonably affect public recreation or the natural        stream environment  or will prove detrimental to the public welfare   it is the state engineer s        duty to  the state engineer shall withhold approval or rejection of the application until the state        engineer has investigated the matter                ii    c   If an application does not meet the requirements of this section  it shall be        rejected                   a   An application to appropriate water for industrial  power  mining development         manufacturing purposes  agriculture  or municipal purposes may be approved for a specific and        certain period from the time the water is placed to beneficial use under the application  but in        no event may an application be granted for a period of time less than that ordinarily needed to        satisfy the essential and primary purpose of the application or until the water is no longer        available as determined by the state engineer               b   At the expiration of the period fixed by the state engineer the water shall revert to        the public and is subject to appropriation as provided by this title               c   No later than    calendar days before the expiration date of the fixed

been satisfied               ii   the need for an extension is not the result of any default or neglect by the applicant         and              iii   the water is still available               e   No extension shall exceed the time necessary to satisfy the primary purpose of the        original application               f   A request for extension of the fixed time period must be filed in writing in the        office of the state engineer on or before the expiration date of the application                   a   Before the approval of any application for the appropriation of water from

applicants with respect to permanent change applications shall be the same as provided in this        title for applications to appropriate water               b   The state engineer may waive notice for a permanent change application if it only        involves a change in point of diversion of     feet or less               c   The state engineer may condition approval of a change application to prevent an        enlargement of the quantity of water depleted by the nature of the proposed use when compared        with the nature of the currently approved use of water proposed to be changed               d   A condition described in Subsection     c  may not include a reduction in the        currently approved diversion rate of water under the water right identified in the change        application solely to account for the difference in depletion under the nature of the proposed        use when compared with the nature of the currently approved use                   a   Except as provided in Subsection     b   the state engineer shall reject a        permanent change application if the person proposing to make the change is unable to meet the        burden described in

i   for part of the water involved               ii   that the applicant acquire a conflicting right  or              iii   that the applicant provide and implement a plan approved by the state engineer to        mitigate impairment of an existing right               c   i   There is a rebuttable presumption of quantity impairment  as defined in        Subsection            to the extent that  for a period of at least seven consecutive years  a        portion of the right identified in a change application has not been               A   diverted from the approved point of diversion  and              B   beneficially used at the approved place of use               ii   The rebuttable presumption described in Subsection     c  i  does not apply if the        beneficial use requirement is excused by               A   Subsection           e                B   an approved nonuse application under Subsection           b                C   Subsection             or              D   the passage of time under Subsection           c  i                d   The state engineer may not consider quantity impairment based on the conditions        described in Subsection     c  unless the issue is raised in a               i   timely protest that identifies which of the protestant s existing rights the protestant        reasonably believes will experience quantity impairment  or              ii   written notice provided by the state engineer to the applicant within    days after        the change application is filed               e   The written notice described in Subsection     d  ii  shall               i   specifically identify an existing right the state engineer reasonably believes may        experience quantity impairment  and              ii   be mailed to the owner of an identified right  as shown by the state engineer s        records  if the owner has not protested the change application               f   The state engineer is not required to include all rights the state engineer believes        may be impaired by the proposed change in the written notice described in Subsection            d  ii                g   The owner of a right who receives the written notice described in Subsection            e  ii  may not become a party to the administrative proceeding if the owner has not filed a        timely protest               h   If a change applicant  all protestants  and all persons identified by the state engineer        under Subsection     d  ii  come to a written agreement regarding how the issue of quantity        impairment shall be mitigated  the state engineer may incorporate the terms of the agreement        into a change application approval Legislative Review Note     as of                  AMOffice of Legislative
