relating to those         markets that  under Subsection     b  v   cause the acquisition not to be exempted from this         section   The commissioner may require additional material and information as considered         necessary to determine whether the proposed acquisition  if consummated  would violate the         competitive standard of Subsection       The required information may include an opinion of an         economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a         summary of the education and experience of the economist indicating the economist s ability to         render an informed opinion                b   The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the commissioner         of a pre acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the   th day after the date of         receipt  or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner   Before the end of the         waiting period  the commissioner on a one time basis may require the submission of additional         needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition  in which event the waiting period         shall end on the earlier of the   th day after receipt of the additional information by the         commissioner or termination of the waiting period by the commissioner                    a   The commissioner may enter an order under Subsection     a  with respect to an         acquisition if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be substantially         to lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state  tend to create a monopoly  or if the         insurer fails to file adequate information in compliance with this section                b   In determining whether a proposed acquisition would violate the competitive         standard of Subsection     a   the commissioner shall consider the following                i   Any acquisition covered under this Subsection     involving two or more insurers         competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standards         if                A   the market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following         shares of the market           Insurer A Insurer B                or more                 or more                  or more  or               B   the market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the         following shares of the market           Insurer A Insurer B                or more                 or more                  or more                 or more                ii   For purposes of this section  a highly concentrated market is one in which the share         of the four largest insurers is     or more of the market   Percentages not shown in the tables         are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown   If more than two insurers         are involved  exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of         violation of the competitive standard in Subsection     a                 iii   For purposes of this section  the insurer with the largest share of the market shall         be considered to be Insurer A                c   There is a significant trend toward increased concentration when the aggregate         market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market  from the two largest to the         eight largest  has increased by    or more of the market over a period of time extending from         any base year   to    years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition   Any         acquisition or merger covered under Subsection     involving two or more insurers competing         in the same market is prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive standard in         Subsection     a  if                i   there is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market                ii   one of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers         showing the requisite increase in the market share  and               iii   another involved insurer s market is    or more                d   The burden of showing prima facie evidence of violation of the competitive         standard rests upon the commissioner                e   Even though an acquisition is not prima facie violative of the competitive standard         under Subsections     b  and     c   the commissioner may establish the requisite         anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence                f   Even though an acquisition is prima facie violative of the competitive standard         under Subsections     b  and     c   a party may establish the absence of the requisite         anticompetitive effect based upon other substantial evidence   Relevant factors in making a         determination under this Subsection     f  include the following                i   market shares                ii   volatility of ranking of market leaders                iii   number of competitors                iv   concentration or trend of concentration in the industry  and               v   ease of entry and exit into the market                g   An order may not be entered under Subsection     if                i   the acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource         use that cannot be feasibly achieved in any other way  and the public benefits that would arise         from the economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition          or               ii   the acquisition will substantially increase the availability of insurance  and the         public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening         competition                    a   Subject to Title   G  Chapter    Administrative Procedures Act  if an         acquisition violates the standards of this section  the commissioner may enter an order                i   requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state         with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation  or               ii   denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do         business in this state                b   The commissioner shall accompany an order issued under this Subsection     with         a written decision of the commissioner setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law                c   An order pursuant to this section may not apply if the acquisition is not         consummated                d   A person who violates a cease and desist order of the commissioner under         Subsection     a  i  and while the order is in effect may after notice and hearing and upon order         of the commissioner be subject at the discretion of the commissioner to one or more of the         following                i   notwithstanding Section   A        a monetary penalty of not more than                 for every day of violation  or               ii   suspension or revocation of the person s license                e   An insurer or other person who fails to make any filing required by this section  and         who fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with a filing requirement  is subject to a         fine of not more than         notwithstanding Section   A                     Section     Section
