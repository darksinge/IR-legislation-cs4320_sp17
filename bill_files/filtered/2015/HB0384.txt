    shall be available for        inspection by the public at the offices of the Utah Association of Counties                   The state finds with respect to the grazing zones described in Subsection     that               a   agricultural livestock industry on the lands comprising these zones has provided a        significant contribution to the history  customs  culture  economy  welfare  and other values of        each area for more than     years               b   the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exists within these zones        if managed properly  that will support and expand continued  responsible agricultural livestock        activities and wildlife habitat               c   agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources         human history  shaping of human endeavors  variety of cultural resources  landmarks         structures  and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition         preservation  and protection               d   i   the highest management priority for lands within these zones is the preservation         restoration  and enhancement of watershed and rangeland health to sustain and expand forage        production for both livestock grazing and wildlife habitat  and the restoration and development        of historic  existing  and future livestock grazing and wildlife habitat resources in order to        provide protection for the resources  objects  customs  culture  and values identified above  and              ii   notwithstanding Subsection     d  i   if part or all of any zone lies within a sage        grouse management area  then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with        the management priorities set forth in Subsection     d  i  to the maximum extent consistent        with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area               e   subject to Subsection     d  ii   responsible development of any deposits of energy        and mineral resources  including oil  natural gas  oil shale  oil sands  coal  phosphate  gold         uranium  and copper  as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential  that may exist in        these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these        zones  and              f   subject to Subsection     d  ii   responsible development of any recreation        resources  including roads  campgrounds  water resources  trails  OHV use  sightseeing         canyoneering  hunting  fishing  trapping  and hiking resources that may exist in these grazing        zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these grazing        zones                   The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection     that the        historic levels of livestock grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection     in each        zone have greatly diminished  or are under other serious threat  due to               a   unreasonable  arbitrary  and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies         including               i   de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non WSAs               ii   ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interior        applicable to each of these zones  and              iii   the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage               b   inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each year        proven to be most effective for maintaining and enhancing rangeland conditions               c   mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage by        excess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery counties               d   improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion  invasive        species  and juniper  and other woody vegetation that               i   compromise watershed and rangeland health               ii   crowd out

available for        inspection by the public at the offices of the Utah Association of Counties                   The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection     that               a   agricultural timber  logging  and forest product industries on the lands comprising        these timber zones have provided a significant contribution to the history  customs  culture         economy  welfare  and other values of each area for many decades               b   abundant natural and vegetative resources exist within these zones to support and        expand continued  responsible timber  logging  and other forest product activities               c   agricultural timber  logging  and forest product activities in these zones  and the        associated historic resources  human history  shaping of human endeavors  variety of cultural        resources  landmarks  structures  and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of        recognition  preservation  and protection               d   i   the highest management priority for lands within these zones is maintenance and        promotion of forest and vegetation ecosystem health achieved by responsible active        management in development of historic  existing  and future timber  logging  and forest        product resources in order to provide protection for the resources  objects  customs  culture         and values identified above  and              ii   notwithstanding Subsection     d  i   if part or all of any zone lies within a sage        grouse management area  then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with        the management priorities set forth in Subsection     d  i  to the maximum extent consistent        with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area               e   subject to Subsection     d  ii   responsible development of any deposits of energy        and mineral resources  including oil  natural gas  oil shale  oil sands  coal  phosphate  gold         uranium  and copper  as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential  that may exist in        these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these        zones  and              f   subject to Subsection     d  ii   responsible development of any recreation        resources  including wildlife  roads  campgrounds  water resources  trails  OHV use         sightseeing  canyoneering  hunting  fishing  trapping  and hiking resources that may exist in        these timber zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in        these timber zones                   The state finds that the historic levels of timber  logging  and forest products        activities in the zones described in Subsection     have greatly diminished  or are under serious        threat  due to               a   unreasonable  arbitrary  and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies         including               i   de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas               ii   ignoring the multiple use sustained yield mission of the Forest Service               iii   ignoring the fact that the Forest Service s parent agency is the United States        Department of Agriculture whose mission includes providing timber as an important        agriculture resource  and              iv   the arbitrary administrative reductions in timber  logging  and forest products        activities               b   improper management of forest vegetation resulting in the overcrowding of old        growth alpine species and the crowding out of aspen diversity  all of which results in               i   devastation of entire mountainsides due to insect infestation and disease               ii   reduced water yield               iii   increased catastrophic wildfire               iv   increased soil erosion               v   degradation of wildlife habitat  and              vi   suppression and threatened extinction of important rural economic activities  and              c   other practices that degrade overall forest health                   To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection      the state        supports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection                   a   efficient and responsible development  within each timber zone  of               i   robust timber thinning and harvesting programs and activities  and              ii   other uses compatible with increased timber  logging  and forest product activities         including a return to historic levels of timber  logging  and forest product activity in each of        these zones               b   a cooperative management approach by federal agencies  the state  and local        governments to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development  within        each timber zone  of               i   forest product resources  and              ii   other uses compatible with timber activities  and              c   effective and responsible management of wildlife habitat                   The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within each timber        zone               a   fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties within        which each timber zone is situated to develop  amend  and implement land and resource        management plans and implement management decisions that are consistent with the purposes         goals  and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under federal law               b   expedite the processing  granting  and streamlining of logging and forest product        harvesting permits  range improvements  and applications to enhance and otherwise develop        existing and permitted timber resources located within each timber zone  including renewable        vegetative resources               c   expedite stewardship programs to allow private enterprise to carry out the timber         logging  and forest activities described in this section               d   allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads  power lines         pipeline infrastructure  and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals  purposes  and policies        described in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles               e   refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine         restrict  or diminish the goals  purposes  and policies for each timber zone as stated in this        section  and              f   subject to Subsection     d  ii   refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary        to the goals and purposes described within this section                   a   The state recognizes the importance of all areas on BLM and Forest Service        lands high value lumber and forest product resources but establishes the special Timber        Agricultural Commodity Zones to provide special protection and preservation against the        identified threats found in Subsection     to exist in these zones               b   It is the intent of the Legislature to designate additional Timber Agricultural        Commodity Zones in future years  if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation        for new zones                   The state calls upon applicable federal  state  and local agencies to coordinate with        each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions  with membership        consisting of representatives from the United States government  the state  and local        governments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management        actions in the zones described in Subsection                        Notwithstanding the provisions of this section  and subject to Subsection            d  ii   the state s mineral  oil  gas  and energy policies  as well as its grazing policies  on        land within zones described in Subsection      shall continue to be
