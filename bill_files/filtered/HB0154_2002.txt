Way                             This act amends the Public Safety Code regarding the collection of DNA specimens and the                          functions of the Bureau of Forensic Services regarding collection of these specimens.  The                          act expands the number of offenses for which a DNA specimen may be collected for the state                          criminal identification data base and includes saliva as an acceptable DNA specimen, in                          addition to blood.  The act provides that collection of the offender s payment of a fee for                           collection of the specimen is second in priority to victim restitution.  The act creates the DNA                           Specimen Restricted Account and specifies funding sources and uses of the account.  The                           effective date of this act is July  ,     .
