under Subsection    , except that        after the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                   a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is        incompetent or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified        by the  division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.              b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the        person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction        imposed in accordance with Section         .              c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for
