The Nurse Licensure Compact is hereby enacted and entered into with all other       jurisdictions that legally join in the compact, which is in form, substantially as follows        NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT       ARTICLE I       Findings and Declaration of Purpose            a. The party states find that              .  The health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and       the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws              .  Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may       result in injury or harm to the public              .  The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication       technologies as part of our nation s health care delivery system require greater coordination and       cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation              .  New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state       nurse licensure laws difficult and complex              .  The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is       cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states  and             .  Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public       safety and public health benefits.            b.  The general purposes of this Compact are to              .  Facilitate the states  responsibility to protect the public s health and safety              .  Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure       and regulation              .  Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse       regulation, investigation, and adverse actions              .  Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each       jurisdiction              .  Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable for meeting all       state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered       through the mutual recognition of party state licenses              .  Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse licenses  and             .  Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet uniform licensure       requirements.       ARTICLE II       Definitions            As used in this Compact             a.

Current significant investigative information  means              .  Investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that       includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse to respond, if required by state law, has       reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor       infraction  or             .  Investigative information that indicates that the nurse represents an immediate threat       to public health and safety regardless of whether the nurse has been notified and had an       opportunity to respond.            e.   Encumbrance  means a revocation or suspension of, or any limitation on, the full       and unrestricted practice of nursing imposed by a licensing board.            f.

A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of        applicants for initial multistate license or licensure by endorsement. Such procedures shall        include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric based information by applicants for        the purpose of obtaining an applicant s criminal history record information from the Federal        Bureau of Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state s criminal records.             c.

If a party state takes such        action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information        system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly        notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.             e.

The practice of nursing in a party state        under a multistate licensure privilege will subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing        board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time        service is provided.             f.  Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party        state s single state license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the        single state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege        to practice nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the        requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single state license.             g.

A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this Compact s effective date,        must meet all applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a multistate license from a new        home state  and              .  A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in Article III.c. due        to a disqualifying event occurring after this Compact s effective date shall be ineligible to retain        or renew a multistate license, and the nurse s multistate license shall be revoked or deactivated        in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure        Compact Administrators   Commission  .        ARTICLE IV        Applications for Licensure in a Party State             a.  Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party        state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the        applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other state, whether there are        any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant,        whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege        held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative        program.             b.  A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only one party        state at a time.             c.  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states,        the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by        the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the        Commission.              .  The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of        residence.              .  A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until the nurse        provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state        and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the new home state.             d.  If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a        non party state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a        single state license, valid only in the former home state.        ARTICLE V        Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards             a.  In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have        the authority to               .  Take adverse action against a nurse s multistate licensure privilege to practice within        that party state.             i.  Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against a nurse s        license issued by the home state.             ii.  For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the        same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such        conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own        state laws to determine appropriate action.              .  Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a nurse s authority to        practice within that party state.              .

The licensing board shall also have the        authority to take appropriate action s  and shall promptly report the conclusions of such        investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The        administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new        home state of any such actions.              .  Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and        testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing        board in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of        evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent        jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas        issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel        expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the        witnesses or evidence are located.              .  Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint or other        biometric based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background        checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal        background checks, and use the results in making licensure decisions.              .  If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse the costs of        investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that        nurse.              .  Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that        the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.             b.  If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse s multistate license, the        nurse s multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated        until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate license. All home state        disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse s multistate license shall include        a statement that the nurse s multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during        the pendency of the order.             c.  Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state s decision that participation in an        alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall        deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse for the        duration of the nurse s participation in an alternative program.        ARTICLE VI        Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information             a.  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all        licensed registered nurses  RNs  and licensed practical vocational nurses  LPNs VNs . This        system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each nurse, as        submitted by party states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement        efforts.             b.  The Commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure        information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification,        collection, and exchange of information under this Compact.             c.  All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information        system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of        applications  with the reasons for such denials , and nurse participation in alternative programs        known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or        confidential under state law.             d.  Current significant investigative information and participation in nonpublic or        confidential alternative programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure        information system only to party state licensing boards.             e.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state licensing boards        contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate        information that may not be shared with non party states or disclosed to other entities or        individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.             f.  Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure        information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with non party states or        disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party        state contributing the information.             g.  Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is        subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that        information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.             h.  The Compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the        Compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum               .
