The charge for these services is determined                             according to the type of services and the test volume, and is based on the cost                             to the Laboratory and therefore may be lower than the fee schedule.  Because                             of changing needs, the Laboratory receives requests for new tests or services                             that are impossible to anticipate and list fully in a standard fee schedule.

The Division assigns a charge to all services performed regardless of the                             client s or third party insurer s financial responsibility or the likelihood of                             receiving payment for the services.  Projected numbers of units of services are                             based on past experiences but are subject to significant variation determined                             by the actual needs of patients and changes in medical practices.  Hence, it is                             not possible to calculate the change in revenue resulting from a change in the                             charge for a given service.

Discount germination is a non priority service intended for carry over                             seed which is ideal for checking inventories from May through August. The                             discount service is available during the rest of the year, but delays in testing                             may result due to high test volume of priority samples.  Ten or more samples                             receive a fifty percent discount off normal germination fees.
