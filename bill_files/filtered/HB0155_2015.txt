by the Legislature of the state of Utah              Section  .  Section       is amended to read                   . Possession by commissioner    Notice    Presentation, allowance, and        disallowance of claims    Objections to claims.                  a   Possession of an institution by the commissioner commences when notice of        taking possession is               i   posted in each office of the institution located in this state  or              ii   delivered to a controlling person or officer of the institution.              b   All notices, records, and other information regarding possession of an institution by        the commissioner may be kept confidential, and all court records and proceedings relating to        the commissioner s possession may be sealed from public access if               i   the commissioner finds it is in the best interests of the institution and its depositors        not to notify the public of the possession by the commissioner               ii   the deposit and withdrawal of funds and payment to creditors of the institution is        not suspended, restricted, or interrupted  and              iii   the court approves.                  a   i   Within    days after taking possession of an institution or other person under        the jurisdiction of the department, the commissioner shall publish a notice to all persons who        may have claims against the institution or other person to file proof of their claims with the        commissioner before a date specified in the notice.              ii   The filing date shall be at least    days after the date of the first publication of the        notice.              iii   The notice shall be published               A   I   in a newspaper of general circulation in each city or county in which the        institution or other person, or any subsidiary or service corporation of the institution, maintains        an office  and              II   published again approximately    days and    days after the date of the first        publication  and              B   as required in Section          for    days.              b   i   Within    days of taking possession of a depository institution, the        commissioner shall send a similar notice to all persons whose identity is reflected in the books        or records of the institution as depositors or other creditors, secured or unsecured, parties to        litigation involving the institution pending at the date the commissioner takes possession of the        institution, and all other potential claimants against the institution whose identity is reasonably        ascertainable by the commissioner from examination of the books and records of the        institution.  No notice is required in connection with accounts or other liabilities of the        institution that will be paid in full or be fully assumed by another depository institution or trust        company.  The notice shall specify a filing date for claims against the institution not less than           days after the date of mailing.  Claimants whose claims against the institution have been        assumed by another depository institution or trust company pursuant to a merger or purchase        and assumption agreement with the commissioner, or a federal deposit insurance agency        appointed as receiver or liquidator of the institution, shall be notified of the assumption of their        claims and the name and address of the assuming party within    days after the claim is        assumed.  Unless a purchase and assumption or merger agreement requires otherwise, the        assuming party shall give all required notices.  Notice shall be mailed to the address appearing        in the books and records of the institution.              ii   Inadvertent or unintentional failure to mail a notice to any person entitled to written        notice under this paragraph does not impose any liability on the commissioner or any receiver        or liquidator appointed by him beyond the amount the claimant would be entitled to receive if        the claim had been timely filed and allowed.  The commissioner or any receiver or liquidator        appointed by him are not liable for failure to mail notice unless the claimant establishes that it        had no knowledge of the commissioner taking possession of the institution until after all        opportunity had passed for obtaining payment through filing a claim with the commissioner,        receiver, or liquidator.              c   Upon good cause shown, the court having supervisory jurisdiction may extend the        time in which the commissioner may serve any notice required by this chapter.              d   The commissioner has the sole power to adjudicate any claim against the        institution, its property or other assets, tangible or intangible, and to settle or compromise        claims within the priorities set forth in Section       .  Any action of the commissioner is        subject to judicial review as provided in Subsection    .              e   A receiver or liquidator of the institution appointed by the commissioner has all the        duties, powers, authority, and responsibilities of the commissioner under this section.  All        claims against the institution shall be filed with the receiver or liquidator within the applicable        time specified in this section and the receiver or liquidator shall adjudicate the claims as        provided in Subsection     d .              f   The procedure established in this section is the sole remedy of claimants against an        institution or its assets in the possession of the commissioner.                  With respect to a claim which appears in the books and records of an institution or        other person in the possession of the commissioner as a secured claim, which, for purposes of        this section is a claim that constitutes an enforceable, perfected lien, evidenced in writing, on        the assets or other property of the institution               a   The commissioner shall allow or disallow each secured claim filed on or before the        filing date within    days after receipt of the claim and shall notify each secured claimant by        certified mail or in person of the basis for, and any conditions imposed on, the allowance or        disallowance.              b   For all allowed secured claims, the commissioner shall be bound by the terms,        covenants, and conditions relating to the assets or other property subject to the claim, as set        forth in the note, bond, or other security agreement which evidences the secured claim, unless        the commissioner has given notice to the claimant of his intent to abandon the assets or other        property subject to the secured claim at the time the commissioner gave the notice described in        Subsection     a .              c   No petition for lifting the stay provided by Section       may be filed with respect        to a secured claim before the claim has been filed and allowed or disallowed by the        commissioner in accordance with Subsection     a .                  With respect to all other claims other than secured claims               a   Each claim filed on or before the filing date shall be allowed or disallowed within            days after the final publication of notice.              b   If notice of disallowance is not served upon the claimant by the commissioner        within     days after the date of final publication of notice, the claim is considered disallowed.              c   The rights of claimants and the amount of a claim shall be determined as of the date        the commissioner took possession of the institution under this chapter.  Claims based on        contractual obligations of the institution in existence on the date of possession may be allowed        unless the obligation of the institution is dependent on events occurring after the date of        possession, or the amount or worth of the claim cannot be determined before any distribution        of assets of the institution is made to claimants having the same priority under Section       .              d   i   An unliquidated claim against the institution, including claims based on alleged        torts for which the institution would have been liable on the date the commissioner took        possession of the institution and any claims for a right to an equitable remedy for breach of        performance by the institution, may be filed in an estimated amount.  The commissioner may        disallow or allow the claim in an amount determined by the commissioner, settle the claim in        an amount approved by the court, or, in his discretion, refer the claim to the court designated by        Section       for determination in accordance with procedures designated by the court.  If the        institution held on the date of possession by the commissioner a policy of insurance that would        apply to the liability asserted by the claimant, the commissioner, or any receiver appointed by        him may assign to the claimant all rights of the institution under  the insurance policy in full        satisfaction of the claim.              ii   If the commissioner finds there are or may be issues of fact or law as to the validity        of a claim, liquidated or unliquidated, or its proper allowance or disallowance under the        provisions of this chapter, he may appoint a hearing examiner to conduct a hearing and to        prepare and submit recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law for final        consideration by the commissioner.  The hearing shall be conducted as provided in rules or        regulations issued by the commissioner.  The decision of the commissioner shall be based on        the record before the hearing examiner and information the commissioner considers relevant        and shall be subject to judicial review as provided in Subsection    .              e   A claim may be disallowed if it is based on actions or documents intended to        deceive the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him.              f   The commissioner may defer payment of any claim filed on behalf of a person who        was at any time in control of the institution within the meaning of Section        , pending the        final determination of all claims of the institution against that person.              g   The commissioner or any receiver appointed by him may disallow a claim that        seeks a dollar amount if it is determined by the court having jurisdiction under Section              that the commissioner or receiver or conservator will not have any assets with which to pay the        claim under the priorities established by Section       .              h   The commissioner may adopt rules to establish such alternative dispute resolution        processes as may be appropriate for the resolution of claims filed against an institution under        this chapter.              i   In establishing alternative dispute resolution processes, the commissioner shall        strive for procedures that are expeditious, fair, independent, and low cost.  The commissioner        shall seek to develop incentives for claimants to participate in the alternative dispute resolution        process.              j   The commissioner may establish both binding and nonbinding processes, which        may be conducted by any government or private party, but all parties, including the claimant        and the commissioner or any receiver appointed by him, must agree to the use of the process in        a particular case.                  Claims filed after the filing date are disallowed, unless               a   the claimant who did not file his claim timely demonstrates that he did not have        notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in time to file a timely proof of claim  and              b   proof of the claim was filed prior to the last distribution of assets.  For the purpose        of this subsection only, late filed claims may be allowed if proof was filed before the final        distribution of assets of the institution to claimants of the same priority and are payable only        out of the remaining assets of the institution.              c   A late filed claim may be disallowed under any other provision of this section.                  Debts owing to the United States or to any state or its subdivisions as a penalty or        forfeiture are not allowed, except for the amount of the pecuniary loss sustained by the act,        transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty or forfeiture arose.                  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection           a , interest accruing on any        claim after the commissioner has taken possession of an institution or other person under this        chapter may be disallowed.                  a   A claim against an institution or its assets based on a contract or agreement may        be disallowed unless the agreement                a    i  is in writing                b    ii  is otherwise a valid and enforceable contract  and               c    iii  has continuously, from the time of its execution, been an official record of the        institution.              b   The requirements of this Subsection     do not apply to claims for goods sold or        services rendered to an institution in the ordinary course of business by trade creditors who do        not customarily use written agreements or other documents.                  a   Objection to any claim allowed or disallowed may be made by any depositor or        other claimant by filing a written objection with the commissioner within    days after service        of the notice of allowance or disallowance.  The commissioner shall present the objection to        the court for hearing and determination upon written notice to the claimant and to the filing        party.  The notice shall set forth the time and place of hearing.  After the    day period, no        objection may be filed.  This Subsection     does not apply to secured claims allowed under        Subsection    .              b   The hearing shall be based on the record before the commissioner and any        additional evidence the court allowed to provide the parties due process of law.              c   The court may not reverse or otherwise modify the determination of the        commissioner with respect to the claim unless it finds the determination of the commissioner to        be arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law.  The burden of proof is on the party        objecting to the determination of the commissioner.              d   An appeal from any final judgment of the court with respect to a claim may be        taken as provided by law by the claimant, the commissioner, or any person having standing to        object to the allowance or disallowance of the claim.                   If a claim against the institution has been asserted in any judicial, administrative,        or other proceeding pending at the time the commissioner took possession of the institution        under this chapter or under Chapter   , Acquisition of Failing Depository Institutions or        Holding Companies, the claimant shall file copies of all documents of record in the pending        proceeding with the commissioner within the time for filing claims as provided in Subsection           .  Such a claim shall be allowed or disallowed within    days of the receipt of the complete        record of the proceedings.  No application to lift the stay of a pending proceeding shall be filed        until the claim has been allowed or disallowed. The commissioner may petition the court        designated by Section       to lift the stay to determine whether the claim should be allowed or        disallowed.                   All claims allowed by the commissioner and not disallowed or otherwise modified        by the court under Subsection    , if not paid within    days after allowance, shall be        evidenced by a certificate payable only out of the assets of the institution in the possession of        the commissioner, subject to the priorities set forth in Section       . This provision does not        apply to a secured claim allowed by the commissioner under Subsection     a .             Section  .  Section        is amended to read                    .

With respect to any reserve account established prior to July  ,      and for which        no legal action is pending as of January  ,     , no recovery shall be had in any action brought        to require payment of interest on, or other compensation for, the use prior to July  ,     , of        the funds in such account unless               a   An agreement in writing expressly so providing was executed by the borrower and        the lender  or              b   The borrower, or his successors or assigns, establishes by clear and convincing        evidence an agreement between the parties that the lender would pay interest on or to otherwise        compensate the borrower for the use of the funds in such account.  Use in the loan documents        of such words as  trust  or  pledge  alone does not establish the intent of the parties  and              c   There is no federal law or regulation prohibiting the payment of interest on or        otherwise compensating the borrower for the use of the funds in such an account.                  No action seeking payment of interest on or other compensation for the use of the        funds in any reserve account for any period prior to July  ,     , shall be brought after June   ,            .  Any recovery in any such action shall be limited to the four year period immediately        preceding the commencement of the action.  No recovery shall be had in respect of any reserve        account established prior to July  ,      greater than if the provisions of Section        of this        act were applicable to such accounts.                  With respect to any reserve account established prior to July  ,     , an agreement        in writing between the lender and the borrower, or his successors or assigns, that               a   the provisions of Section        of this act shall apply to all payments made        subsequent to July  ,      ,   or              b   the borrower may exercise, for the period subsequent to July  ,     , either of the        options provided in Section        of this act, shall bar any recovery by the borrower, his        successors or assigns, for interest on or other compensation for the use of the funds in such        account for any period prior to July  ,     .

Registration system established by issuer.                  a   Each issuer is authorized to establish and maintain a system of registration with        respect to each obligation it issues.              b   The system described in this Subsection     may either be                a    i   a system pursuant to which only certificated registered public obligations are        issued , or  b                 ii   a system pursuant to which only uncertificated registered public obligations are        issued ,   or               c    iii   a system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered        public obligations are issued.              c   The issuer may amend, discontinue, and reinstitute  any  a system established under        this section, from time to time, subject to covenants.                  The system shall be established, amended, discontinued, or reinstituted, for the        issuer by, and shall be maintained for the issuer as provided by, the official or official body.                  The system shall be described in the registered public obligation or in the official        actions which provide for original issuance of the registered public obligation, and in        subsequent official actions providing for amendments and other matters from time to time. The        description may be by reference to a program of the issuer which is established by the official        or official body.                  The system shall define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered        public obligation is effective with respect to the issuer, and by which payment of principal and        any interest shall be made. The system may permit the issuance of registered public obligations        in any denomination to represent several registered public obligations of smaller        denominations. The system may also provide for the form of any certificated registered public        obligation or of any writing relating to an uncertificated registered public obligation, for        identifying numbers or other designations, for a sufficient supply of certificates for subsequent        transfers, for record and payment dates, for varying denominations, for communications to        holders or owners of obligations, and for accounting, cancelled certificate destruction,        registration and release of security interests and other incidental matters. Unless the issuer        otherwise provides, the record date for interest payable on the first or fifteenth days of a month        shall be the fifteenth day or the last business day of the preceding month, respectively, and for        interest payable on other than the first or fifteenth days of a month, shall be the fifteenth        calendar day before the interest payment date.                  Under a system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered        public obligations are issued, both types of registered public obligations may be regularly        issued, or one type may be regularly issued and the other type issued only under described        circumstances or to particular described categories of owners and provision may be made for        registration and release of security interests in registered public obligations.                  The system may include covenants of the issuer as to amendments,        discontinuances, and reinstitutions of the system and the effect of such on the exemption of        interest from the income tax provided for by the Code.                  Whenever an issuer issues an uncertificated registered public obligation, the system        of registration may provide that, as long as the uncertified registered obligation remains        outstanding and unpaid, a true copy of the official actions of the issuer relating to the        uncertificated registered public obligation will be maintained by the issuer or by the person, if        any, maintaining the system on behalf of the issuer.  A copy of such official actions verified by        an authorized officer is admissible before any court of record, administrative body, or        arbitration panel without further authentication.                  Nothing in this act precludes conversion from one form of registered public        obligation provided by this act to a form of obligation not provided by this act if interest on the        converted obligation continues to be exempt from income taxation under the Code.

Each resolution, ordinance, or order under which a water conservancy district         levied a Class B, Class C, or Class D assessment before April   ,      under the law in effect         at the time of the levy is validated, ratified, and confirmed, and a water conservancy district         may continue to levy the assessment according to the terms of the resolution, ordinance, or         order.

At the request of an institutionalized spouse or a community spouse, at the         beginning of the first continuous period of institutionalization of the institutionalized spouse         and upon the receipt of relevant documentation of resources, the division shall promptly assess         and document the total value described in Subsection     a  and shall provide a copy of that         assessment and documentation to each spouse and shall retain a copy of the assessment.

The division may not find an institutionalized spouse to be ineligible for medical         assistance by reason of resources determined under Subsection     to be available for the cost         of care when                a   the institutionalized spouse has assigned to the state any rights to support from the         community spouse                b   i   except as provided in Subsection     b  ii , the institutionalized spouse lacks the         ability to execute an assignment due to physical or mental impairment                ii   Subsection     b  i  does not prevent the division from seeking a court order         seeking an assignment of support  or               c   the division determines that denial of medical assistance would cause an undue         burden.                   During the continuous period in which an institutionalized spouse is in an         institution and after the month in which an institutionalized spouse is eligible for medical         assistance, the resources of the community spouse may not be considered to be available to the         institutionalized spouse.                   When an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for medical         assistance, in determining the amount of the spouse s income that is to be applied monthly for         the cost of care in the nursing care facility, the division shall deduct from the spouse s monthly         income the following amounts in the following order                a   a personal needs allowance, the amount of which is determined by the division                b   a community spouse monthly income allowance, but only to the extent that the         income of the institutionalized spouse is made available to, or for the benefit of, the community         spouse                c   a family allowance for each family member, equal to at least     of the amount that         the amount described in Subsection      a  i  exceeds the amount of monthly income of that         family member  and               d   amounts for incurred expenses for the medical or remedial care for the         institutionalized spouse.                    a   Except as provided in Subsection      b , the division shall establish a         minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance for each community spouse which is not less         than the sum of                i        of the current poverty guideline for a two person family unit that applies to         this state as established by the United States Department of Health and Human Services  and               ii   an excess shelter allowance.               b   The amount provided in Subsection      a  may not exceed   ,   , unless a court         order establishes a higher amount.                    a   An institutionalized spouse or a community spouse may request a hearing with         respect to the determinations described in Subsections      e  i  through  v  if an application         for medical assistance has been made on behalf of the institutionalized spouse.               b   A hearing under this subsection regarding the community spouse resource         allowance shall be held by the division within    days from the date of the request for the         hearing.               c   If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs income, above the         level otherwise provided by the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, due to         exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, there shall be substituted,         for the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance provided under Subsection     , an         amount adequate to provide additional income as is necessary.               d   If either spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance, in         relation to the amount of income generated by the allowance is inadequate to raise the         community spouse s income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall         be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance, an amount adequate to provide a         minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.               e   A hearing may be held under this subsection if either the institutionalized spouse or         community spouse is dissatisfied with a determination of                i   the community spouse monthly income allowance                ii   the amount of monthly income otherwise available to the community spouse                iii   the computation of the spousal share of resources under Subsection                    iv   the attribution of resources under Subsection      or               v   the determination of the community spouse resource allocation.                    a   An institutionalized spouse may transfer an amount equal to the community         spouse resource allowance, but only to the extent the resources of the institutionalized spouse         are transferred to or for the sole benefit of the community spouse.               b   The transfer under Subsection      a  shall be made as soon as practicable after the         date of the initial determination of eligibility, taking into account the time necessary to obtain a         court order under Subsection      c .               c  Chapter   , Medical Benefits Recovery Act, does not apply if a court has entered an         order against an institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse.

the existence of any paid up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the         company on the policy  if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and         benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation         has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is         delivered  and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and         paid up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the         last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.               g   Any of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the         plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.               h   The company shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender         value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy with the         consent of the commissioner  provided, however, that the policy shall remain in full force and         effect until the insurer has made the payment.                   a   Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a         premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by Subsection    ,         shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on such anniversary, of         the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any         existing paid up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of                 a    i   the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in Subsections             and    , corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such         anniversary ,   and                b    ii   the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the policy.               b   Provided, however, that for any policy issued on or after the operative date of         Subsection     d  as defined therein, which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity         benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or         supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in  the first paragraph of         this subsection  Subsection     a  shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash         surrender value as defined in  such paragraph  Subsection     a  for an otherwise similar policy         issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash         surrender value as defined in  such paragraph  Subsection     a  for a policy which provides         only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.               c   Provided, further, that for any family policy issued on or after the operative date of         Subsection     d  as defined therein, which defines a primary insured and provides term         insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse s age   ,         the cash surrender value referred to in  the first paragraph of this subsection  Subsection     a          shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in  such         paragraph  Subsection     a  for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without         such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in  such         paragraph  Subsection     a  for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided         by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.               d   Any cash surrender value available within    days after any policy anniversary         under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments or any policy continued         under any paid up nonforfeiture benefit, whether or not required by Subsection     shall be an         amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits         provided for by the policy, including any existing paid up additions, decreased by any         indebtedness to the company on the policy.                   Any paid up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default         in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of         such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the         policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by         this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a         specified period.                   a   i   This Subsection      a   does not apply to policies issued on or after the         operative date of Subsection     d  as defined therein.               ii   Except as provided in Subsection     c , the adjusted premiums for any policy shall         be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective         premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged         because of impairments or special hazards, that the present value, at the date of issue of the         policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of                 i    A   the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the         policy                 ii    B      of the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or of         the equivalent uniform amount if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy                 iii    C       of the adjusted premium for the first policy year  and                iv    D       of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted         premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with         uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of         insurance, whichever is less.               iii   Provided, however, that in applying the percentages specified in Subsections             a   iii   ii  C  and   iv    D , no adjusted premium shall be considered to exceed    of the         amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.  The date of issue of a policy for         the purpose of this  section  Subsection     shall be the date as of which the rated age of the         insured is determined.               b   In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of         the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of this  section  Subsection             shall be considered to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar         policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and         for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under         which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy          provided, however, that in the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued         on the life of a child under age   , the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though         the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age    were the         amount provided by such policy at age   .               c   i   The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider         or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to the sum of                 i    A   the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age         without such term insurance benefits, increased ,   and               B   during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable,          by  ii   the adjusted premiums for such term insurance , the .               ii   The foregoing items   i  and  ii  of this   A  and  B  of Subsection     c  i  being         calculated separately and as specified in Subsections     a  and  b  except that, for the purposes         of   ii ,  iii , and  iv    B ,  C , and  D  of Subsection     a  ii , the amount of insurance or         equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in calculation of the adjusted premiums referred         to in   ii    B  of  this  Subsection     c  i  shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding         amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted         premiums in   i    A  of this Subsection     c  i .               d   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , all adjusted premiums and present         values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the         basis of the Commissioner s      Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, provided that for any         category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values         may be calculated according to an age not more than three years younger than the actual age of         the insured and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the         basis of the      Standard Industrial Mortality Table.  All calculations shall be made on the         basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding        per annum, specified in the policy for         calculating cash surrender values and paid up nonforfeiture benefits.  Provided, however, that         in calculating the present value of any paid up term insurance with accompanying pure         endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be         not more than      of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table.  Provided,         further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted         premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified         by the company and approved by the commissioner.                   a   This Subsection     a  does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the         operative date of Subsection     d  as defined therein.  In the case of ordinary policies issued         on or after the operative date of Subsection     a  as defined in Subsection     b , all adjusted         premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the         Commissioner s      Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the rate of interest as specified in         the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid up nonforfeiture benefits, provided         that such rate of interest may not exceed        per annum for policies issued before June  ,             ,    per annum for policies issued on or after May   ,     , and before April  ,     ,         and the rate of interest may not exceed        per annum for policies issued after April  ,             , except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of         interest not exceeding        per annum may be used, and provided that for any category of         ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be         calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the         insured.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present value of any paid up term insurance         with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of         mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner s      Extended         Term Insurance Table. Provided, further, that for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the         calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table         of mortality as may be specified by the company and approved by the commissioner.               b   Any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to         comply with the provisions of Subsection     a  after a specified date before January  ,     .          After filing such notice, then upon such specified date, which is the operative date of         Subsection     a  for such company, this Subsection     a  shall become operative with respect         to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such company.  If a company makes no such         election, the operative date of Subsection     a  for such company is January  ,     .               c   i   This Subsection     c  does not apply to industrial policies issued after the         operative date of Subsection     d  as defined therein.  In the case of industrial policies issued         on or after the operative date of this Subsection     c  as defined herein, all adjusted premiums         and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the         Commissioner s      Standard Industrial Mortality Table and the rate of interest specified in         the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid up nonforfeiture benefits, provided         that such rate of interest may not exceed        per annum for policies issued before June  ,             ,    per annum for policies issued after May   ,     , and before April  ,     , and                per annum for policies issued after April  ,     , except that for any single premium         whole life or endowment insurance policy issued after April  ,     , a rate of interest not         exceeding        per annum may be used.  Provided, however, that in calculating the present         value of any paid up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a         nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the         Commissioner s      Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.  Provided, further, that for         insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and         present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the         company and approved by the commissioner.               ii   Any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to         comply with the provisions of this Subsection     c  after a specified date before January  ,             .  After filing such notice, then upon that specified date, which is the operative date of this         Subsection     c  for such company, this Subsection     c  shall become operative with respect         to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such company.  If a company makes no such         election, the operative date of this Subsection     c  for such company shall be January  ,     .               d   i   This Subsection     d  applies to all policies issued on or after the operative date         of this Subsection     d  as defined herein.  Except as provided in Subsection     d  vii , the         adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such         uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year,         excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also         excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a         statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid up         nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of policy, of all adjusted         premiums shall be equal to the sum of                A   the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy                B      of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the         average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first    policy years  and               C        of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined.  Provided,         however, that in applying the percentage specified in  C , no nonforfeiture net level premium         shall be considered to exceed    of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform         in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first    policy         years.  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this Subsection     d  shall be the date as         of which the rated age of the insured is determined.               ii   The nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date         of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the         present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the         date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls         due.               iii   In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled         changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or         premiums other than change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall         initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from         those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy.  At the time of any such change in the         benefits or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums, and         present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not         change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.               iv   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection     d  vii , the recalculated future         adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective         future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts specified in         the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover         impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or         policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash         surrender values and paid up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of         change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall         be equal to the excess of                A   the sum of                I   the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the         policy  and               II   the additional expense allowance, if any ,   over               B   the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid up nonforfeiture         benefit under the policy.               v   The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined         benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of                A      of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning         of each of the first    policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of         insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first    policy years subsequent to         the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date         of issue of the policy  and               B        of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.               vi   The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to  the result         obtained by dividing  A  by  B  where                 A    equals  the sum of                I   the nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present         value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or         subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the         change not occurred  and               II   the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the         policy   and  divided by               B    equals  the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each         anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.               vii   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection     d  to the contrary, in         the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis which provides reduced graded amounts of         insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an         otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis which provides higher uniform amounts         of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be         calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the         standard basis.               viii   All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall                A   for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of                 A    I   the Commissioner s      Standard Ordinary Mortality Table  or                B    II   at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life         insurance, the Commissioner s      Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten Year Select         Mortality Factors   shall                B   for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the         Commissioner s      Standard Industrial Mortality Table  and  shall                C   for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a         rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in  this  Subsection             d  x , for policies issued in that calendar year.   Provided, however, that                 ix   Notwithstanding Subsection     d  viii                  I    A   At the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a         particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the         nonforfeiture interest rate, as defined in  this  Subsection     d  x , for policies issued in the         immediately preceding calendar year.                II    B   Under any paid up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid up dividend         additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by Subsection    , shall         be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the         amount of such paid up nonforfeiture benefit and paid up dividend additions, if any.                III    C   A company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid up         nonforfeiture benefit, including paid up additions under the policy, on the basis of an interest         rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.                IV    D   In calculating the present value of any paid up term insurance with         accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality         assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioner s      Extended Term         Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioner s              Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance.                V    E   For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such         adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the         aforementioned tables.                VI    F   Any ordinary mortality tables, adopted after      by the National         Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rules adopted by the         commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard, may be substituted         for the Commissioner s      Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten Year         Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioner s      Extended Term Insurance Table.                VII    G   Any industrial mortality tables, adopted after      by the National         Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rules adopted by the         commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted         for the Commissioner s      Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.                ix    x   The nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular         calendar year shall be equal to      of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for         such policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearest one fourth of   .                x    xi   Notwithstanding any other provision in this title to the contrary, any refiling         of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy         form which involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute         nonforfeiture values does not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.                xi    xii   After the effective date of this Subsection     d , any company may, at any         time before January  ,     , file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to         comply with the provisions of this subsection with regard to any number of plans of insurance         after a specified date before January  ,     , which specified date shall be the operative date of         this Subsection     d  for the plan or plans, but if a company elects to make the provisions of         this subsection operative before January  ,     , for fewer than all plans, the company shall         comply with rules adopted by the commissioner.

Any written report submitted by an expert shall                a   identify the specific matters referred for evaluation                b   describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination and the         purpose or purposes for each                c   state the expert s clinical observations, findings, and opinions  and               d   identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the basis for the         expert s clinical findings and opinions.

The burden of         proof is upon the proponent of mental retardation at the hearing.               b   A finding of mental retardation does not operate as an adjudication of mental         retardation for any purpose other than exempting the person from a sentence of death in the         case before the court.                    a   The defendant is presumed not to possess the mental deficiencies listed in         Subsection      a        unless the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, finds that the         defendant has significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that exists concurrently         with significant deficiencies in adaptive functioning and that this functioning was manifested         prior to age   .  The burden of proof is upon the proponent of that proposition.               b   If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has         significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that exists concurrently with significant         deficiencies in adaptive functioning and that this functioning was manifested prior to age   ,         then the burden is upon the state to establish that any confession by the defendant which the         state intends to introduce into evidence is supported by substantial evidence independent of the         confession.                    a   If the court finds the defendant mentally retarded, it shall issue an order                i   containing findings of fact and conclusions of law, and addressing each of the         factors in Subsections     a  and  b   and               ii   stating that the death penalty is not a sentencing option in the case before the court.               b   If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant possesses         the mental deficiencies listed in Subsection      a        and that the state fails to establish         that any confession is supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession, the         state may proceed with its case and                i   introduce the confession into evidence, and the death penalty will not be a         sentencing option in the case  or               ii   not introduce into evidence any confession or the fruits of a confession that the         court has found is not supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession, and the         death penalty will be a sentencing option in the case.               c   i   A finding by the court regarding whether the defendant qualifies for an         exemption under Section      a     is a final determination of that issue for purposes of this         chapter.               ii   The following questions may not be submitted to the jury by instruction, special         verdict, argument, or other means                A   whether the defendant is mentally retarded for purposes of this chapter  and               B   whether the defendant possesses the mental deficiencies specified in Subsection              a       .               iii   This chapter does not prevent the defendant from submitting evidence of         retardation or other mental deficiency to establish a mental condition as a mitigating         circumstance under Section         .                    A ruling by the court that the defendant is exempt from the death penalty may be         appealed by the state pursuant to  Subsection  Section      a       h  .
