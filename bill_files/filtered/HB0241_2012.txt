In making                           determinations regarding removal of a child from a foster home, the division may not dismiss                           the foster family as a mere collection of unrelated individuals.                                b   The Legislature finds that children in the temporary custody and custody of the                           division are experiencing multiple changes in foster care placements with little or no                           documentation, and that numerous studies of child growth and development emphasize the                           importance of stability in foster care living arrangements.                                c   For the reasons described in Subsections     a  and  b , the division shall provide                           procedural due process for a foster family prior to removal of a foster child from their home,                           regardless of the length of time the child has been in that home, unless removal is for the                           purpose of                                 i   returning the child to the child s natural parent or legal guardian                                 ii   immediately placing the child in an approved adoptive home                                 iii   placing the child with a relative, as defined in Subsection       A              b , who                           obtained custody or asserted an interest in the child within the preference period described in                           Subsection       A               a   or                                iv   placing an Indian child in accordance with preplacement preferences and other                           requirements described in the Indian Child Welfare Act,    U.S.C. Sec.     .                                    a   The division shall maintain and utilize due process procedures for removal of a                           foster child from a foster home, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Title                             G, Chapter  , Administrative Procedures Act.                                b   Those procedures shall include requirements for                                 i   personal communication with, and a written explanation of the reasons for the                           removal to, the foster parents prior to removal of the child  and                                ii   an opportunity for foster parents to present their information and concerns to the                           division and to                                 A   request a review, to be held before removal of the child, by a third party neutral                           fact finder  or                                   B   if the child has been placed with the foster parents for a period of at least two years,                           request a review, to be held before removal of the child, by                                 I   the juvenile court judge currently assigned to the child s case  or                                II   if the juvenile court judge currently assigned to the child s case is not available,                           another juvenile court judge.                                c   If the division determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that the child is                           in danger or that there is a substantial threat of danger to the health or welfare of the child, it                           shall place the child in emergency foster care during the pendency of the procedures described                           in this subsection, instead of making another foster care placement.                                    If the division removes a child from a foster home based upon the child s statement                           alone, the division shall initiate and expedite the processes described in Subsection    .  The                           division may take no formal action with regard to that foster parent s license until after those                           processes, in addition to any other procedure or hearing required by law, have been completed.                                    When a complaint is made to the division by a foster child against a foster parent,                           the division shall, within    business days, provide the foster parent with information regarding                           the specific nature of the complaint, the time and place of the alleged incident, and who was                           alleged to have been involved.                                    Whenever the division places a child in a foster home, it shall provide the foster                           parents with                                 a   notification of the requirements of this section                                 b   a written description of the procedures enacted by the division pursuant to                           Subsection     and how to access those processes  and                                c   written notification of the foster parents  ability to petition the juvenile court                           directly for review of a decision to remove a foster child who has been in their custody for                              months or longer, in accordance with the limitations and requirements of Section       A          .                                    The requirements of this section do not apply to the removal of a child based on a                           foster parent s request for that removal.                                    It is unlawful for a person, with the intent to avoid compliance with the                           requirements of this section, to                                 a   take action, or encourage another to take action, against the license of a foster                           parent  or                                   b   remove a child from a foster home before the child has been placed with the foster                           parents for two years.                                    The division may not remove a foster child from a foster parent who is a relative, as                          defined in Subsection       A              b , of the child on the basis of the age or health of the                          foster parent without clear and convincing evidence that the foster parent is incapable of caring                          for the foster child.
