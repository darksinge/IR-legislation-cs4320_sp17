Construction of this part.                                This part sets forth the definitions in the Master Settlement Agreement, as of November                             ,     , that are cross referenced in Part  , Model Tobacco Settlement Statute.  This part is                           intended for convenience only and may not be construed as substantively or otherwise altering Part                            , Model Tobacco Settlement Statute, or the Master Settlement Agreement.  In the event of a                           discrepancy between this part and the Master Settlement Agreement, currently or as amended, the                           provisions of the Master Settlement Agreement shall govern.                                Section  .    Section                  is enacted to read                                          .  Formula for inflation adjustments.                                The formula for calculating inflation adjustments, which is referenced in Subsection                                              , is set forth in Exhibit C of the Master Settlement Agreement as follows, with the                              exception of Subsection     which is omitted                                                     Exhibit C                                           Formula For Calculating Inflation Adjustment                                         Any amount that, in any given year, is to be adjusted for inflation pursuant to                               this exhibit, the  base amount,  shall be adjusted upward by adding to such base amount                               the inflation adjustment.                                         The inflation adjustment shall be calculated by multiplying the base amount by                               the inflation adjustment percentage applicable in that year.                                         The inflation adjustment percentage applicable to payments due in the year                                    shall be equal to the greater of    or the CPI .  For example, if the Consumer Price                               Index for December     , as released in January     , is    higher than the Consumer                               Price Index for December     , as released in January     , then the CPI  with respect                               to a payment due in      would be   .  The inflation adjustment percentage applicable                               in the year      would thus be   .                                         The inflation adjustment percentage applicable to payments due in any year                               after      shall be calculated by applying each year the greater of    or the CPI  on the                               inflation adjustment percentage applicable to payments due in the prior year.
