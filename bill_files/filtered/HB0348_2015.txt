If after    working days the inaccuracies cannot be resolved, the         court shall make a determination of relevance and accuracy on the record.               b   If a party fails to challenge the accuracy of the presentence investigation report at         the time of sentencing, that matter shall be considered to be waived.

running of the probation period is tolled upon the filing of a violation report         with the court alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of probation or upon the issuance         of an

probation, the court that authorized probation shall         determine if the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or         extension of probation is justified.               ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the         defendant a warrant for the defendant s arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show         cause why the defendant s probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.               c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall         be served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.               ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.               iii   The order to show

call witnesses, appear and speak in the defendant s own behalf,         and present evidence.               e   i   After the hearing the court shall make findings of fact.               ii   Upon a finding that the defendant violated the conditions of probation, the court         may order the probation revoked, modified, continued, or that the entire probation term         commence anew.                iii   If probation is revoked, the defendant shall be sentenced or the sentence         previously imposed shall be executed.                iii   If a period of incarceration is imposed for a violation, the defendant shall be         sentenced within the graduated sanctions guidelines established by the Utah Sentencing         Commission pursuant to Section   M      , unless the judge determines that                A   the defendant needs substance abuse or mental health treatment, as determined by a         risk and needs assessment, that warrants treatment services that are immediately available in         the community  or               B   the sentence previously imposed shall be executed.               iv   If the defendant had, prior to the imposition of a term of incarceration or the         execution of the previously imposed sentence under this Subsection     , served time in jail         due to a violation of probation under Subsection             e  iii ,
