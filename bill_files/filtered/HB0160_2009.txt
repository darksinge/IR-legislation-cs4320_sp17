A health care provider shall comply with the decision of a majority of the members                            of the highest priority class who have communicated their views to the provider if                                  a   more than one member of the highest priority class assumes authority to act as                            default surrogate                                  b   the members of the class do not agree on a health care decision  and                                 c   the health care provider is informed of the disagreement among the members of the                            class.                                     a   An adult may at any time disqualify a default surrogate, including a member of                            the adult s family, from acting as the adult s surrogate by                                  i   a signed writing                                  ii   personally informing a witness of the disqualification  or                                 iii   informing the surrogate of the disqualification.                                 b   Disqualification of a surrogate is effective even if the adult has been found to lack                            health care decision making capacity.
