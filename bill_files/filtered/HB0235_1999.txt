A violation of any provision of this section is a class B misdemeanor unless the actor                           discharges a firearm under any of the following circumstances not amounting to criminal homicide                           or attempted criminal homicide, in which case it is a third degree felony                                 a   the actor discharges a firearm in the direction of any person or persons, knowing or                           having reason to believe that any person may be endangered                                 b   the actor, with intent to intimidate or harass another or with intent to damage a                           habitable structure as defined in Subsection                    , discharges a firearm in the direction of                           any building  or                                c   the actor, with intent to intimidate or harass another, discharges a firearm in the                           direction of any vehicle.                                    a   If a violation of Subsection     b  includes the discharging of the firearm in the                          direction of a habitable structure as defined in Section                 , the convicted person shall be                          sentenced to an enhanced minimum term of three years in prison.                                b   The prosecuting attorney, or grand jury if an indictment is returned, shall cause to be                          subscribed upon the information or indictment notice that the defendant is subject to the enhanced                          penalty provided under this Subsection    .  The notice shall be in a clause separate from and in                          addition to the substantive offense charged.                                c   If the subscription is not included initially, the court may subsequently allow the                          prosecutor to amend the charging document to include the subscription if the court finds the                          charging documents, including any statement of probable cause, provide notice to the defendant                          of the allegation he committed a violation of Subsection     b  involving discharging a firearm at                          a habitable structure, or if the court finds the defendant has not otherwise been substantially                          prejudiced by the omission.                                d   The sentencing judge rather than the jury shall decide whether to impose the enhanced                          penalty under this Subsection    .  The imposition of the penalty is contingent upon a finding by                          the sentencing judge that this Subsection     is applicable.  In conjunction with sentencing the                          court shall enter written findings of fact concerning the applicability of this section.                                   e   The court may suspend the imposition or execution of the sentence required under this                          section if the court                                 i   finds that the interests of justice would be best served  and                                ii   states the specific circumstances justifying the disposition on the record and in writing.                                          This section does not apply to a person                                 a   who discharges any kind of firearm when that person is in lawful defense of self or                           others  or                                b   who is performing official duties as provided in Sections            .      and                   and                           as otherwise provided by law.
