All proceedings before the juvenile court related to charges filed under Subsection                                shall be conducted in conformity with the rules established by the Utah Supreme Court.                                     a   If the information alleges the violation of a felony listed in Subsection    , the                            state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish                            probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection     has been committed                            and that the defendant committed it.  If proceeding under Subsection     b , the state shall have                            the additional burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has                            previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous                            weapon.                                 b   If the juvenile court judge finds the state has met its burden under this Subsection                               , the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district                            court in the same manner as an adult unless the juvenile court judge finds that all of the                            following conditions exist                                  i   the minor has not been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense involving                            the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult                                  ii   that if the offense was committed with one or more other persons, the minor                            appears to have a lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants  and                                    iii   that the minor s role in the offense was not committed in a violent, aggressive, or                            premeditated manner.                                 c   Once the state has met its burden under this Subsection     as to a showing of                            probable cause, the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and presenting evidence                            as to the existence of the above conditions.                                 d   If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that all the above                            conditions are satisfied, the court shall so state in its findings and order the minor held for trial                            as a minor and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.                                     If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed, but that the                            state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over                            under Subsection    , the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor                            and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition.                                     At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue.                             The defendant shall have the same right to bail as any other criminal defendant and shall be                            advised of that right by the juvenile court judge.  The juvenile court shall set initial bail in                            accordance with Title   , Chapter   , Bail.                                     If an indictment is returned by a grand jury charging a violation under this section,                            the preliminary examination held by the juvenile court judge need not include a finding of                            probable cause that the crime alleged in the indictment was committed and that the defendant                            committed it, but the juvenile court shall proceed in accordance with this section regarding the                            additional considerations listed in Subsection     b .                                     When a defendant is charged with multiple criminal offenses in the same                            information or indictment and is bound over to answer in the district court for one or more                            charges under this section, other offenses arising from the same criminal episode and any                            subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against him shall be considered together with                            those charges, and where the court finds probable cause to believe that those crimes have been                            committed and that the defendant committed them, the defendant shall also be bound over to                            the district court to answer for those charges.                                     A minor who is bound over to answer as an adult in the district court under this                            section or on whom an indictment has been returned by a grand jury is not entitled to a                            preliminary examination in the district court.                                        Allegations contained in the indictment or information that the defendant has                            previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous                            weapon, or is    years of age or older, are not elements of the criminal offense and do not need                            to be proven at trial in the district court.                                      If a minor enters a plea to, or is found guilty of, any of the charges filed or any                            other offense arising from the same criminal episode, the district court retains jurisdiction over                            the minor for all purposes, including sentencing.                                      The juvenile court under Section       A           and the Division of Juvenile Justice                            Services regain jurisdiction and any authority previously exercised over the minor when there                            is an acquittal, a finding of not guilty, or dismissal of all charges in the district court.
