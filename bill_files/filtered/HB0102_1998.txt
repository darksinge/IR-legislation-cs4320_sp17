The commissioner may waive the requirements of this section as to any person          who has been an active insurance agent or broker in another state for two years immediately prior          to applying for a license in this state, but only if the applicant s state of residence has imposed          upon the applicant education requirements  which  that are substantially as rigorous as those of          this state.
