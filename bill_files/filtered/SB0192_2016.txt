Sponsors    Modifications       Utah Code Section   G       currently contains a limit on the amount that anindividual may claim against a governmental entity for damages for personal injury, and a limiton the aggregate amount of individual awards that may be awarded in relation to a singleoccurrence.     If an individual s claim against a governmental entity for damages for personalinjury exceeds the amount of that statutory limit, the individual cannot recover the amount ofdamages that exceed the statutory limit, or the individual has the option of seeking recovery ofsome or all of that amount through a process before the state Board of Examiners.  Likewise, ifmultiple individuals  claims against a governmental entity for damages for personal injuryarising from the same occurrence exceed the aggregate limit, those individuals cannot recoverthe amount of damages that exceed the statutory limit, or those individuals have the option ofseeking recovery of some or all of that amount through a process before the state Board ofExaminers.     Some have expressed an interest in exploring possible alternatives to the currentsystem in order to enable those with legitimate claims for personal injury damages that exceedthe statutory limits to recover their damages while still protecting taxpayer money against largepersonal injury damage claims.     This issue is very complex, and formulating a workable alternative to the currentsystem will require the thoughtful participation of a number of stakeholders.     The Legislature encourages the formation of a voluntary, informal working groupor task force  a   to study possible options to the current statutory system for dealing with legitimate,large individual and aggregate personal injury damage claims, while still protecting taxpayermoney and limited government resources  and b   with representation from  i   the Division of Risk Management  ii   the Insurance Department  iii   state agencies covered under the Risk Management Fund  iv   local governments, including counties, cities, towns, local districts, special servicedistricts, school districts, and other political subdivisions of the state  v   the Office of the Attorney General  vi   trial lawyers representing personal injury plaintiffs  vii   the insurance industry  viii   the Utah Public Risk Manager s Association  and ix   other groups, associations, or entities with an interest in the issue described inSubsection    .
