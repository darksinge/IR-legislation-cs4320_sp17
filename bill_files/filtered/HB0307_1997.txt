There is established an Expedited Visitation Enforcement Pilot Program in the third          judicial district to be administered by the Administrative Office of the Courts from July  ,     ,          to July  ,     .                   This pilot program is to resolve visitation problems on an expedited basis by enabling          a parent who alleges that his court ordered visitation rights have been violated to file a request for          enforcement of the order, have a conference scheduled with the other parent and a private mediator          to address visitation issues within    days of filing the request, and have the private mediator          assess the situation, facilitate an agreement on visitation between the parties, and make an          appropriate recommendation to the court on a timely basis.  Within    days, an agreement on          visitation shall become a temporary order under the signature of the court.                   The Judicial Council shall make rules to implement and administer this pilot program.                   The parties to a proceeding initiated in the third district court to enforce the terms of          a visitation order shall participate in this pilot program, unless one of the parties                a   makes an allegation of child sexual abuse implicating the other party, in which case,          the mediator shall refer the matter to the court and report the allegation to the Division of Child          and Family Services consistent with Title   A, Chapter  a, Part  , Child Abuse or Neglect          Reporting Requirements  or               b   is unwilling to participate in the program, in which case, the matter shall be referred          to the court.                          The Administrative Office of the Courts shall adopt a program to evaluate the         effectiveness of this pilot program.  Progress reports shall be provided to the Judiciary Interim         Committee in August      and as requested thereafter by the committee.  At least once during this         pilot program, the Administrative Office of the Courts shall present to the committee the results         of a survey that measures the effectiveness of the program in terms of increased compliance with         visitation orders and the responses of interested persons.                  a   The Department of Human Services shall apply for federal funds designated for         visitation, if such funds are available.  The department shall contract any federal funds received         under this application to the Administrative Office of the Courts for the administration of this pilot          program.               b   This pilot program shall be funded through funds received under Subsection  a , the          Children s Legal Defense Account as established in Section      a  , or other available funding.           Without funding, the pilot program may not proceed.              Section  .  Section    A        is amended to read                  A       .

If the child refuses to return to school or go to the receiving center, the officer or          administrator shall, without unnecessary delay, notify the child s parents, guardian, or custodian          and release the child to their custody.                   If the parents, guardian, or custodian cannot be reached or are unable or unwilling to          accept custody, the child shall be referred to the Division of Child and Family Services.                          a   A local school board, singly or jointly with another school board, may establish or         designate receiving centers within existing school buildings and staff the centers with existing         teachers or staff to provide educational guidance and counseling for truant children.  Upon receipt         of a truant child, the center shall, without unnecessary delay, notify and direct the child s parents,         guardian, or custodian to come to the center, pick up the child, and return the child to school.              b   If the parents, guardian, or custodian cannot be reached or are unable or unwilling to         comply with the request within a reasonable time, the center shall take such steps as are reasonably         necessary to insure the safety and well being of the child, including, when appropriate, returning         the child to school or referring the child to the Division of Child and Family Services.

The division shall take legal action that is necessary to enforce the provisions of this          chapter.                   The attorney general shall enforce all provisions of this chapter, in addition to the          requirements of Title   , Chapter  a, relating to protection and custody of abused, neglected, or          dependent children and relating to ungovernable children who are in the custody of the division.           The attorney general may contract with the local county attorney to enforce the provisions of this          chapter and Title   , Chapter  a.                   It is the responsibility of the attorney general s office to                a   advise the division regarding decisions to remove a child from his home                b   represent the division in all court and administrative proceedings related to child abuse,                 neglect, and dependency including, but not limited to, shelter hearings, dispositional hearings,         dispositional review hearings, periodic review hearings, and petitions for termination of parental         rights  and              c   be available to and advise caseworkers on an ongoing basis.

Those attorneys  shall be housed in various offices of the division         statewide, and  shall devote their full time and attention to that representation and, insofar as it is         practicable, shall be housed in or near various offices of the division statewide.               Section  .  Section    A  a     is amended to read                  A  a    .  Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of           state.                    There is a presumption that it is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised          under the care and supervision of his natural parents.   A child s need for a normal family life in          a permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships will usually best be met by his          natural parents.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit, and the right of parents to conceive          and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth          Amendment to the United States Constitution.   Parents have a natural, legal, and moral right, as          well as duty, to care for their children.  The right of a fit, competent parent to raise his child has          long been protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United States.                    As a counterweight to parental rights, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest in and          responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide for their          welfare.   There are circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a substantial departure          from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and proper parental care and          protection.   Under those circumstances, the welfare of children is the consideration of paramount          importance.                   When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,          it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm  and also the          emotional impact of separating the child from his family .  Throughout its involvement, the          division shall attempt to utilize the least intrusive means available to protect a child, in an effort          to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families, rather than in temporary foster                 placements under the supervision of the state.                  When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s safety or welfare,          however,  the state s interest in the child s welfare is paramount to the  natural right and authority          rights of  the  a parent.  The division may obtain custody of the child for a planned period and         place him in a safe environment, in accordance with the requirements of Title   , Chapter  a, Part          , Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.                  In cases where obvious physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or abandonment are         involved, the state has no duty to maintain a child in his home, provide reunification services, or         to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                         It is the division s obligation, under federal law, to achieve permanency for          children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  If, because of his conduct or condition, a parent          is determined to be unfit or incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights          described in Title   , Chapter  a, Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act, the welfare and best          interest of the child is then of paramount importance, and shall govern in determining whether that          parent s rights should be terminated.

If that right is waived, the purpose of the waiver shall be made         a matter of record at the proceeding.              e   At the time of the commitment proceeding, the appropriate local mental health         authority, its designee, or the psychiatrist who has been in charge of the child s care prior to the         commitment proceeding, shall provide the neutral and detached fact finder with the following         information, as it relates to the period of current admission               i   the petition for commitment               ii   the admission notes               iii   the child s diagnosis                iv   physicians  orders                v   progress notes                vi   nursing notes  and               vii   medication records.               f   The information described in Subsection  e  shall also be provided to the child s parent          or legal guardian upon written request.               g   i   The neutral and detached fact finder s decision of commitment shall state the          duration of the commitment.  Any commitment to the physical custody of a local mental health          authority may not exceed     days.  Prior to expiration of the commitment, and if further          commitment is sought, a hearing shall be conducted in the same manner as the initial commitment          proceeding, in accordance with the requirements of this section.               ii   When a decision for commitment is made, the neutral and detached fact finder shall          inform the child and his parent or legal guardian of that decision, and of the reasons for ordering          commitment at the conclusion of the hearing, and also in writing.               iii   The neutral and detached fact finder shall state in writing the basis of his decision,          with specific reference to each of the criteria described in Subsection    , as a matter of record.                   Absent the procedures and findings required by this section, a child may be temporarily          committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority only in accordance with the          emergency procedures described in Subsection   A           or    .  A child temporarily          committed in accordance with those emergency procedures may be held for a maximum of             hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.  At the expiration of that time period, the          child shall be released unless the procedures and findings required by this section have been                  satisfied.                  A local mental health authority shall have physical custody of each child committed         to it under this section.  The parent or legal guardian of a child committed to the physical custody         of a local mental health authority under this section, retains legal custody of the child, unless legal         custody has been otherwise modified by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In cases when the         Division of Family Services or the Division of Youth Corrections has legal custody of a child, that         division shall retain legal custody for purposes of this part.                  The cost of caring for and maintaining a child in the physical custody of a local mental         health authority shall be assessed to and paid by the child s parents, according to their ability to          pay.  For purposes of this section, the Division of Child and Family Services or the Division of          Youth Corrections shall be financially responsible, in addition to the child s parents, if the child          is in the legal custody of either of those divisions at the time the child is committed to the physical          custody of a local mental health authority under this section, unless Medicaid regulation or          contract provisions specify otherwise.  The Office of Recovery Services shall assist those divisions          in collecting the costs assessed pursuant to this section.                   Whenever application is made for commitment of a minor to a local mental health          authority under any provision of this section by a person other than the child s parent or guardian,          the local mental health authority or its designee shall notify the child s parent or guardian.  The          parents shall be provided sufficient time to prepare and appear at any scheduled proceeding.                    a   Each child committed pursuant to this section is entitled to an appeal within             days after any order for commitment.  The appeal may be brought on the child s own petition, or          that of his parent or legal guardian, to the juvenile court in the district where the child resides or          is currently physically located.  With regard to a child in the custody of the Division of Child and          Family Services or the Division of Youth Corrections, the attorney general s office shall handle          the appeal, otherwise the appropriate county attorney s office is responsible for appeals brought          pursuant to this subsection.               b   Upon receipt of the petition for appeal, the court shall appoint a designated examiner          previously unrelated to the case, to conduct an examination of the child in accordance with the          criteria described in Subsection    , and file a written report with the court.  The court shall then          conduct an appeal hearing to determine whether the findings described in Subsection     exist by          clear and convincing evidence.                       c   Prior to the time of the appeal hearing, the appropriate local mental health authority,         its designee, or the mental health professional who has been in charge of the child s care prior to         commitment, shall provide the court and the designated examiner for the appeal hearing with the         following information, as it relates to the period of current admission               i   the original petition for commitment               ii   admission notes               iii   diagnosis               iv   physicians  orders               v   progress notes                vi   nursing notes  and               vii   medication records.               d   Both the neutral and detached fact finder and the designated examiner appointed for          the appeal hearing shall be provided with an opportunity to review the most current information          described in Subsection      c  prior to the appeal hearing.               e   The child, his parent or legal guardian, the person who submitted the original petition          for commitment, and a representative of the appropriate local mental health authority shall be          notified by the court of the date and time of the appeal hearing.  Those persons shall be afforded          an opportunity to appear at the hearing.  In reaching its decision, the court shall review the record          and findings of the neutral and detached fact finder, the report of the designated examiner          appointed pursuant to Subsection      b , and may, in its discretion, allow or require the testimony          of the neutral and detached fact finder, the designated examiner, the child, the child s parent or          legal guardian, the person who brought the initial petition for commitment, or any other person          whose testimony the court deems relevant.  The court may allow the child to waive his right to          appear at the appeal hearing, for good cause shown.  If that waiver is granted, the purpose shall be          made a part of the court s record.                    Each local mental health authority has an affirmative duty to conduct periodic          evaluations of the mental health and treatment progress of every child committed to its physical          custody under this section, and to release any child who has sufficiently improved so that the          criteria justifying commitment no longer exist.                    a   A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s          current treating mental health professional may release an improved child to a less restrictive                  environment, as they determine appropriate.  Whenever the local mental health authority or its         designee, and the child s current treating mental health professional, determine that the conditions         justifying commitment no longer exist, the child shall be discharged and released to his parent or         legal guardian.  With regard to a child who is in the physical custody of the State Hospital, the         treating psychiatrist or clinical director of the State Hospital shall be the child s current treating         mental health professional.              b   A local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s current         treating mental health professional, is authorized to issue a written order for the immediate         placement of a child not previously released from an order of commitment into a more restrictive          environment, if the local authority or its designee and the child s current treating mental health          professional has reason to believe that the less restrictive environment in which the child has been          placed is exacerbating his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others.               c   The written order described in Subsection      b  shall include the reasons for          placement in a more restrictive environment and shall authorize any peace officer to take the child          into physical custody and transport him to a facility designated by the appropriate local mental          health authority in conjunction with the child s current treating mental health professional.  Prior          to admission to the more restrictive environment, copies of the order shall be personally delivered          to the child, his parent or legal guardian, the administrator of the more restrictive environment, or          his designee, and the child s former treatment provider or facility.               d   If the child has been in a less restrictive environment for more than    days and is          aggrieved by the change to a more restrictive environment, the child or his representative may          request a review within    days of the change, by a neutral and detached fact finder as described          in Subsection    .  The fact finder shall determine whether                i   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is exacerbating his          mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others  or               ii   the less restrictive environment in which the child has been placed is not exacerbating          his mental illness, or increasing the risk of harm to himself or others, in which case the fact finder          shall designate that the child remain in the less restrictive environment.               e   Nothing in this section prevents a local mental health authority or its designee, in          conjunction with the child s current mental health professional, from discharging a child from          commitment or from placing a child in an environment that is less restrictive than that designated                  by the neutral and detached fact finder.                   Each local mental health authority or its designee, in conjunction with the child s         current treating mental health professional shall discharge any child who, in the opinion of that         local authority, or its designee, and the child s current treating mental health professional, no         longer meets the criteria specified in Subsection    , except as provided by Section      a                 a    .  The local authority and the mental health professional shall assure that any further         supportive services required to meet the child s needs upon release will be provided.                   Even though a child has been committed to the physical custody of a local mental         health authority pursuant to this section, the child is still entitled to additional due process          proceedings, in accordance with Section   A       . , before any treatment which may affect a          constitutionally protected liberty or privacy interest is administered.  Those treatments include, but          are not limited to, antipsychotic medication, electroshock therapy, and psychosurgery.              Section   .

Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Removing a child from his home    Grounds for removal.                  The Division of Child and Family Services may not remove a child from the custody         of his natural parent unless  that is the least intrusive method available for protecting the child,         and  there is substantial cause to believe that any one of the following exist               a   there is  a substantial  obvious danger to the physical health or safety of the minor and         the minor s physical health or safety may not be protected without removing him from his parent s          custody.  If a minor has previously been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent, and a          subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie          evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the custody of his parent                b   the minor is suffering  severe  emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but not          limited to, extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward self          or others, and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor s emotional health may          be protected without removing the minor from the custody of his parent                c   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been physically or          sexually abused, or is deemed to be at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused, by          a parent, a member of the parent s household, or other person known to the parent.  If a parent has          received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred,          and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the          alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of          being physically or sexually abused                d   the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child                e   the minor has been left without any provision for his support                f   a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for          safe and appropriate care for the minor                g   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the parent is          unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the parent are          unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful                h   the minor is in immediate need of medical care                        i   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to         the child s health or safety               j   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been severely neglected          or              k   the child s welfare is otherwise endangered, as documented by the caseworker.                  The Division of Child and Family Services may not remove a minor from the custody         of his natural parent solely on the basis of educational neglect.             Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Shelter hearing.                   A shelter hearing shall be held within    hours after removal of a child from his home,          excluding weekends and holidays.                   Upon removal of a child from his home and receipt of that child into protective          custody, the division shall issue a notice that contains all of the following                a   the name and address of the person to whom the notice is directed                b   the date, time, and place of the shelter hearing                c   the name of the minor on whose behalf a petition is being brought                d   a concise statement regarding the allegations and code sections under which the          proceeding has been instituted                e   a statement that the parent or guardian to whom notice is given, and the minor, are          entitled to have an attorney present at the shelter hearing, and that if the parent or guardian is          indigent and cannot afford an attorney, and desires to be represented by an attorney, one will be          provided  and               f   a statement that the parent or guardian is liable for the cost of support of the minor in          the protective custody, temporary custody, and custody of the division, and the cost for legal          counsel appointed for the parent or guardian under Subsection     e , according to his financial          ability.

The court may also provide an opportunity for the minor to testify.               b   The court may consider all relevant evidence, in accordance with the Utah Rules of          Juvenile Procedure.  The court shall hear relevant evidence presented by the minor, his parent or          guardian, the requesting party, or their counsel, but may in its discretion limit testimony and          evidence to only that which goes to the issues of removal and the child s need for continued          protection.                   If the child is in the protective custody of the division, the division shall report to the          court                a   the reasons why the minor was removed from the parent s or guardian s custody                b   any services provided to the child and his family in an effort to prevent removal                c   the need, if any, for continued shelter                d   the available services that could facilitate the return of the minor to the custody of his          parent or guardian  and               e   whether the child has any relatives who may be able and willing to take temporary          custody.                   If necessary to protect the child, preserve the rights of a party, or for other good cause          shown, the court may grant no more than one time limited continuance, not to exceed five judicial          days.                   The court shall order that the minor be released from the protective custody of the          division unless it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that any one of the following exist                a   there is  a substantial  obvious danger to the physical health or safety of the minor and                  the minor s physical health or safety may not be protected without removing him from his parent s         custody.  If a minor has previously been adjudicated as abused, neglected, or dependent and a         subsequent incident of abuse, neglect, or dependency occurs, that fact constitutes prima facie         evidence that the child cannot safely remain in the custody of his parent               b   the minor is suffering  severe  emotional damage, as may be indicated by, but is not         limited to, extreme anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or negative aggressive behavior toward self         or others, and there are no reasonable means available by which the minor s emotional health may         be protected without removing the minor from the custody of his parent               c   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been physically or          sexually abused, or is deemed to be at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused, by          a parent, a member of the parent s household, or other person known to the parent.  If a parent has          received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred,          and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the          alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of          being physically or sexually abused                d   the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child                e   the minor has been left without any provision for his support                f   a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for          safe and appropriate care for the minor                g   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the parent is          unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the parent are          unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful                h   the minor is in immediate need of medical care                i   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to          the child s health or safety   or                j   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been severely neglected           or               k   the child s welfare is otherwise endangered.                   a   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether reasonable          efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his home and          whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued removal.  If the                  court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or guardian through         the provision of those services, it shall place the minor with his parent or guardian and order that         those services be provided by the division.              b   In cases where obvious physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or abandonment are         involved, the state has no duty to maintain a child in his home, return a child to his home, provide         reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                   Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency         situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, even with reasonable services being         provided, the court shall make a finding that  the  any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was          reasonable.                    The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of          educational neglect as described in Subsection     a        q  ii .                    a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it shall          state the facts on which that decision is based.               b   If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall state          the facts on which that decision is based.                     In any case, if  If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody is          necessary for the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned          home, it shall order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child,          or the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of          this chapter or Title   A, Chapter  a, Family Services.

If that parent requests custody, the court          shall place the minor with that parent unless it finds that the placement would be unsafe or          otherwise detrimental to the child.  The provisions of this Subsection     are limited by the                  provisions of Subsection     b .              b   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section     a    , for purposes of this section          natural parent  includes only a biological or adoptive parent whose consent for adoption would         be required pursuant to Section        .  .               b    c   i   The court shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that parent to         assume custody, and the safety and appropriateness of the placement.               ii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct an         investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.                iii   If the court orders an investigation by the division, the division   ii   The court shall,          at a minimum, order the division to visit the parent s home, perform criminal background checks          in accordance with Sections     a    .  and   A  a    . , and check the division s management          information system for any previous reports of abuse or neglect received by the division regarding          the parent at issue.               iii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any further          investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.               iv   The division shall report its findings in writing to the court.               v   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending its          determination regarding that placement.                   If the court orders placement with a parent under Subsection    ,  it  the child and the          parent are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may order that the parent          assume custody subject to the supervision of the court, and order that services be provided to the          parent from whose custody the child was removed, the parent who has assumed custody, or both.           The court may also provide for reasonable visitation with the parent from whose custody the child          was removed, if that is in the best interest of the child.  The court s order shall be periodically          reviewed to determine whether                a   placement with the parent continues to be in the child s best interest                b   the child should be returned to the original custodial parent                c    the child should be placed with a relative, pursuant to Subsection      or               d   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                   The time  periods  limitations described in Section     a     with regard to          reunification efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance                  with Subsection    .                  Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection     or            .  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition that         court for modification of the order.                  a   If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of his         parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at that time, determine         whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child.  The court may order the         Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a reasonable search to determine whether there         are relatives of the child who are willing and appropriate, in accordance with the requirements of          this  section  part and Title   A, Chapter  a, Part  , Child Welfare Services, for placement of the          child.  The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the division pending that          determination.  This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an identified relative will          receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration may be given to a relative s          request for placement of the child, if it is in the best interest of the child, and the provisions of this          section are satisfied.               b   i   If a willing relative is identified pursuant to Subsection     a , the court shall make          a specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative to assume custody, and the safety and          appropriateness of placement with that relative.   The court may order the Division of Child and          Family Services to conduct an investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the          placement.   In order to be considered a  willing relative  under this section, the relative shall be          willing to cooperate if the child s permanency goal is reunification with his parent or parents, and          be willing to adopt or take permanent custody of the child if that is determined to be in the best          interest of the child.               ii   The court shall, at a minimum, order the division  shall  to conduct criminal          background checks in accordance with Sections     a    .  and   A  a    . , report its findings          in writing to the court, and provide sufficient information so that the court may determine whether                 i    A   the relative has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other          children that may indicate or present a danger to this child                 ii    B   the child is comfortable with the relative                 iii    C   the relative recognizes the parent s history of abuse and is determined to protect          the child                         iv    D   the relative is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent for         access to the child, in accordance with court orders                v    E   the relative is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary  and               vi    F   the relative can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.              iii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any further         investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.              c   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the         division s investigation pursuant to Subsection  b , and the court s determination regarding that         placement.  The court shall ultimately base its determination regarding placement with a relative          on the best interest of the child.               d   For purposes of this section,  relative  means an adult who is a grandparent, aunt,          uncle, or sibling of the child.                   When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative pursuant to Subsection                    it shall order that the relative assume custody subject to the continuing supervision of the          court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided to the minor and the relative.  That          placement shall be periodically reviewed by the court to determine whether                a   placement with the relative continues to be in the child s best interest                b   the child should be returned home  or               c   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                   a   When the court vests custody of a child with  another parent or  a relative pursuant          to  this section, the child is not within the temporary custody or custody of the Division of Child          and Family Services.  The  Subsection    , the child , any parent affected by this section,  and any          relative with whom the child is placed, are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The          court may enter any order that it  deems  considers necessary for the protection and best interest          of the child.  The time  periods  limitations described in Section     a    , with regard to          reunification efforts, apply to children placed with a relative pursuant to Subsection          .               b   When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of his parent and does          not vest custody in another parent or relative under this section, the court shall order that the child          be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, to proceed to          adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and services in accordance with this          chapter and Title   A, Chapter  a, Family Services.                           a   Any preferential consideration that a relative may be initially granted pursuant to         Subsection           expires    days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that time period         has expired, a relative who has not obtained custody or asserted an interest in a child, may not be         granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.              b   When a period of    days from the date of the shelter hearing has expired, the         preferential consideration which may initially be granted to a natural parent in accordance with         Subsection    , is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best         interest of the child.  The court shall take into consideration               i   the extent of the natural parent s relationship with the child                ii   whether the natural parent had actual knowledge of the child s removal from the other          parent s custody                iii   whether, in the past, the natural parent has participated in raising the child by taking          responsibility for the child, maintaining a relationship with the child, and financially supporting          the child in accordance with the parent s abilities  and               iv   the nature and extent of the child s relationships and well being in his current          placement.                   Children who are placed with a parent or relative pursuant to Subsection     or     are          not in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services and, therefore, unless otherwise          specifically provided by statute, the provisions described in this part and in Title   A, Chapter  a,          Part  , Child Welfare Services, that relate to children in the custody of the division, need not be          applied.  The court, however, may in its discretion apply any of those provisions to a child who          is not in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services.              Section   .  Section      a    .  is amended to read                    a    . .  Criminal background checks necessary prior to out of home placement.                   Upon  removing  ordering removal of a child from the custody of his parent and          placing that child in the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services, and prior to the           Division of Child and Family Services   division s placement of that child in out of home care,          the court shall require the completion of a fingerprint background check by the Utah Bureau of          Criminal Identification  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  regarding the proposed          placement.                   The Division of Child and Family Services and the Office of the Guardian ad Litem                   are authorized to  may request, or the court upon its own motion may order, the Department of         Public Safety to conduct a complete Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal background check         through the national criminal history system  NCIC .  The cost of those investigations shall be         borne by whoever is to receive placement of the child, except that the Division of Child and         Family Services may pay all or part of the cost of those investigations if the person with whom the         child is to be placed is unable to pay.             Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Pretrial and adjudication hearing    Time deadlines.                  Upon the filing of a petition, the clerk of the court shall set the pretrial hearing on the          petition within    calendar days from the date of the shelter hearing.                   The pretrial may be continued upon motion of any party, for good cause shown, but          the final adjudication hearing shall be held no later than         calendar days from the date of the          shelter hearing.              Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .  Adjudication    Dispositional hearing    Time deadlines.                   If, at the adjudication hearing, the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that          the allegations contained in the petition are true, it shall conduct a dispositional hearing.                   The dispositional hearing may be held on the same date as the adjudication hearing,          but shall be held no later than    calendar days after the date of the adjudication hearing.                   At the adjudication hearing or the dispositional hearing the court shall schedule the          dates for                a   the six month periodic review  and               b   the permanency hearing.              Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .  Dispositional hearing    Reunification services    Exceptions.                   The court may make any of the dispositions described in Section     a    , place the          child in the custody or guardianship of any individual or public or private entity or agency, order          protective supervision, family preservation, medical or mental health treatment, or other services.                   a    Except as provided in Subsection    , whenever  Whenever the court orders          continued removal at the dispositional hearing,  and that the minor remain in the custody of the          Division of Child and Family Services,  it shall first determine whether reunification services are                  appropriate for the child and the child s family, pursuant to Subsection    .  In cases where obvious         physical or sexual abuse, neglect, or abandonment are involved, the state has no duty to provide         reunification services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  If the court         determines that reunification services are appropriate, however, it shall order that the division         make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and his parent for the purpose of         facilitating reunification of the family,  within a maximum  for a specified period of time.  That         time period may not  to  exceed    months from the date that the child was initially removed from         his home  by the division .  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an         entire    months of reunification services.  If reunification services have been ordered, the court          may terminate those services at any time.               b   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period          described in Subsection  a  does not interrupt the running of the period.               c    At the expiration of the    month period described in Subsection  a , a dispositional          review  If reunification services have been ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted by          the court in accordance with Section     a     at the expiration of the time period for          reunification services.  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the          original removal of the child.   If at that time the child cannot be safely returned to the care and          custody of his parent without court supervision, a permanency plan for the child shall be finalized.           If the child clearly desires contact with the parent, the court shall take the child s desire into          consideration in determining the permanency plan.                d   With regard to a child who is two years of age or younger at the time the court orders          reunification services, the court  may order  shall consider ordering the discontinuance of those          services after six months if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to comply with          the treatment plan.  The burden is upon the parents, and the division if it supports continued          reunification services, to show that the parents have made substantial efforts to comply with the          plan during the first six months of reunification services.                   a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide          permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a          parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited.  In cases where obvious physical or          sexual abuse, neglect, or abandonment are involved, the state has no duty to provide reunification          services or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  The court may, under any                  circumstances, determine that efforts to reunify a child with his family are not appropriate or are         not reasonable, based on the individual circumstances, and that reunification services  need  should         not be provided.   In any case, there               b   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a parent         if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following circumstances exist                a    i   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit         indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                b    ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders him         incapable of utilizing  those  reunification services  that finding shall be based on competent          evidence from mental health professionals establishing that, even with the provision of services,          the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within    months                 c    iii   the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical or          sexual abuse, that following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of his parent,          was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent, and the minor is being removed due to          additional physical or sexual abuse                 d    iv   the parent has been convicted of causing the death of another child through abuse          or neglect                 e    v   the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the          parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the minor                 f    vi   the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the          parent, and the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services with          the offending parent                 g    vii   the parent s rights have been terminated with regard to any other child                 h    viii   the child has been removed from his home on at least two previous occasions          and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times  or                i    ix   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification          efforts or services, including any ground for termination of parental rights.                   a   Failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with any previous          treatment plan, the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs          or alcohol, a past history of violent behavior, whether a parent continues to live with an individual          who abused the child, any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the child to repeated                  abuse, or testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be         successful,  are relevant factors to consider  shall be considered in determining whether         reunification services  should be ordered  are appropriate.              b   The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in         reunification with the child, in determining whether  to order that  reunification services  be         provided  are appropriate.                  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a , and the         whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the         minor, the court may order the division to provide reunification services.  The time limits          described in Subsection    , however, are not tolled by the parent s absence.                   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable services          unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.  In determining          detriment, the court shall consider the age of the child, the degree of parent child bonding, the          length of the sentence, the nature of the treatment, the nature of the crime or illness, the degree of          detriment to the child if services are not offered and, for minors ten years of age or older, the          minor s attitude toward the implementation of family reunification services, and any other          appropriate factors.  Reunification services for an incarcerated or institutionalized parent are          subject to the    month limitation imposed in Subsection      unless the court determines that          continued reunification services would be in the child s best interest .                   If, pursuant to Subsection     b  ,  c ,  d ,  e ,  f ,  g ,  h , or  i   ii ,  iii ,  iv , v ,  vi ,           vii ,  viii , or  ix , the court does not order reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be          conducted within          days  for establishment of a permanency plan for the child , in          accordance with  Subsection  Section     a         .              Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .  Permanency hearing    Final plan    Petition for termination of parental           rights filed    Hearing on termination of parental rights.                   A  dispositional review  permanency hearing shall be held by the court no later than             months after the original removal of the child, either by the division or by the court.                   a   If reunification services were ordered by the court in accordance with Section              a    , the court shall  order that  determine whether the child may safely be returned to the          custody of his parent  unless it .  If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that return                  of the child would create a substantial risk of detriment to  his  the child s physical or emotional         well being, the child may not be returned to the custody of his parent.  The failure of a parent or         guardian to participate in, comply with, in whole or in part, or to meet the goals of a court         approved treatment plan constitutes prima facie evidence that return of the child to that parent         would  be detrimental  create a substantial risk of detriment.              b   In making a determination under this section, the court shall review the report prepared         by the Division of Child and Family Services, a report prepared by the child s guardian ad litem,         any report prepared by a foster care citizen review board pursuant to Section     g    , any         evidence regarding the efforts or progress demonstrated by the parent, and the extent to which the          parent cooperated and availed himself of services provided.                c   The court shall determine whether reasonable services have been offered or provided          to the parent or guardian.                    a   If a child is not returned to his parent or guardian at the  dispositional review           permanency hearing, the court shall    a   order the division to develop a permanent plan, and          schedule a hearing within     days after the dispositional review hearing to  order termination of          reunification services to the parent, and make a final determination regarding whether termination          of parental rights, adoption, guardianship, or long term foster care is the most appropriate final          plan for the child   .  If the child clearly desires contact with the parent, the court shall take the          child s desire into consideration in determining the final plan.                b   order termination of reunification services to the parent  and                 c    b   The court may, in its discretion, enter any other order that it determines to be in          the best interest of the child.  The court may order the division to provide protective supervision          or other services to a child and the child s family after the division s custody of a child has been          terminated.                   If the final plan for the child is to proceed toward termination of parental rights, the          petition for termination of parental rights shall be filed, and a pretrial held, within    calendar days          after the permanency hearing.  Within     calendar days after the date of the permanency hearing,          the hearing on termination of parental rights shall be completed.              Section   .

Separate procedures for minors committed to the Division of Child and          Family Services on grounds other than abuse or neglect.                  The processes and procedures described in Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency         Proceedings do not apply to a minor who is committed to the custody of the Division of Child and         Family Services on a basis other than abuse or neglect.                   The procedures described in Subsection     a        a  shall be applied to the minors          described in Subsection    .

A foster parent does not lose standing to file a petition under this section solely because          the division removes the child from that home .                   The  attorney general shall file a petition for termination of parental rights under this          part on behalf of the division.               Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .  Evidence of grounds for termination.                   In determining whether a parent or parents have abandoned a child, it is prima facie          evidence of abandonment that the parent or parents                a   although having legal custody of the child, have surrendered physical custody of the          child, and for a period of six months following the surrender have not manifested to the child or                  to the person having the physical custody of the child a firm intention to resume physical custody         or to make arrangements for the care of the child  or              b   have failed to communicate with the child by mail, telephone, or otherwise for six         months or failed to have shown the normal interest of a natural parent, without just cause.                  In determining whether a parent or parents are unfit or have neglected a child the court         shall consider, but is not limited to, the following conditions               a   emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent that renders him         unable to care for the immediate and continuing physical or emotional needs of the child for         extended periods of time                b   conduct toward a child of a physically, emotionally, or sexually cruel or abusive          nature                c   habitual or excessive use of intoxicating liquors, controlled substances, or dangerous          drugs that render the parent unable to care for the child                d   repeated or continuous failure to provide the child with adequate food, clothing,          shelter, education, or other care necessary for his physical, mental, and emotional health and          development by a parent or parents who are capable of providing that care.  However, a parent          who, legitimately practicing his religious beliefs, does not provide specified medical treatment for          a child is not for that reason alone a negligent or unfit parent                e   with regard to a child who is in the custody of the division, if the parent is incarcerated          as a result of conviction of a felony, and the sentence is of such length that the child will be          deprived of a normal home for more than one year  or               f   a history of violent behavior.                   If a child has been placed in the custody of the division and the parent or parents fail          to comply substantially with the terms and conditions of a plan  to reunite the family  within six          months after the date on which the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs          later, that failure to comply is evidence of failure of parental adjustment.                   The following circumstances constitute prima facie evidence of unfitness                a   sexual abuse, injury, or death of a sibling of the child due to known or substantiated          abuse or neglect by the parent or parents                b   conviction of a felony, if the facts of the crime are of such a nature as to indicate the          unfitness of the parent to provide adequate care to the extent necessary for the child s physical,                  mental, or emotional health and development  or              c   a single incident of life threatening or gravely disabling injury to or disfigurement of         the child.             Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Specific considerations where child is not in physical custody of parent.                  If a child is not in the physical custody of the parent or parents, the court, in         determining whether parental rights should be terminated shall consider, but is not limited to, the         following               a   in cases where the grounds for termination include failure of parental adjustment, the          court shall consider the services provided or offered to the parent or parents to facilitate a reunion          with the child                b   the physical, mental, or emotional condition and needs of the child and his desires          regarding the termination, if the court determines he is of sufficient capacity to express his desires           and               c   the effort the parent or parents have made to adjust their circumstances, conduct, or          conditions to make it in the child s best interest to return him to his home after a reasonable length          of time, including but not limited to                i   payment of a reasonable portion of substitute physical care and maintenance, if          financially able                ii   maintenance of regular visitation or other contact with the child that was designed and          carried out in a plan to reunite the child with the parent or parents  and               iii   maintenance of regular contact and communication with the custodian of the child.                   For purposes of this section, the court shall disregard incidental conduct, contributions,          contacts, and communications.               Section   .

If any of          the facts required are not known by the petitioner, the petition shall so state.                   At any time after a petition is filed, the court may make an order providing for          temporary custody of the minor.                   The court may order that a minor concerning whom a petition has been filed shall be          examined by a physician, surgeon, psychiatrist, or psychologist and may place the minor in a          hospital or other facility for examination. After notice and a hearing set for the specific purpose,          the court may order a similar examination of a parent or guardian whose ability to care for a minor          is at issue, if the court finds from the evidence presented at the hearing that the parent s or          guardian s physical, mental, or emotional condition may be a factor in causing the neglect,          dependency, or delinquency of the minor.                   Pursuant to Rule     d    , Utah Rules of Evidence, examinations conducted pursuant          to Subsection     are not privileged communications, but are exempt from the general rule of          privilege.                         The court may dismiss a petition at any stage of the proceedings.              Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .

In all other cases a verbatim record shall also be made unless dispensed                  with by the court.                  a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , the county attorney or, if within a         prosecution district, the district attorney shall represent the state in any proceeding in a minor s         case.              b   The attorney general shall enforce all provisions of Title   A, Chapter  a, Family         Services, and Title   , Chapter  a, Juvenile Courts, relating to protection or custody of an abused,         neglected, or dependent child, and petitions for termination of parental rights.                  The board may adopt special rules of procedure to govern proceedings involving         violations of traffic laws or ordinances, fish and game laws, and boating laws. However,          proceedings involving offenses under Section     a     are governed by that section regarding          suspension of driving privileges.

The court shall make a finding of the facts upon which it bases its          jurisdiction over the minor.  However, in cases within the provisions of Subsection     a       ,          findings of fact are not necessary.               b   If the court adjudicates a minor for a crime of violence or an offense in violation of          Title   , Chapter   , Part  , Weapons, it shall order that notice of the adjudication be provided to          the school superintendent of the district in which the minor resides or attends school.

A minor placed in          a forestry camp or similar facility may be required to work on fire prevention, forestation and          reforestation, recreational works, forest roads, and on other works on or off the grounds of the          facility and may be paid wages, subject to the approval of and under conditions set by the court.               i   The court may order that the minor be required to repair, replace, or otherwise make          restitution for damage or loss caused by his wrongful act, including costs of treatment as stated in          Section     a    , and may impose fines in limited amounts.               j   The court may issue orders necessary for the collection of restitution and fines ordered          by the court, including garnishments, wage withholdings, and executions.               k   i   The court may through its probation department encourage the development of          employment or work programs to enable minors to fulfill their obligations under Subsection     i           and for other purposes considered desirable by the court.               ii   Consistent with the order of the court, the probation officer may permit the minor                  found to be within the jurisdiction of the court to participate in a program of work restitution or         community service in lieu of paying part or all of the fine imposed by the court.  The work         restitution or community service permitted by the probation officer may not affect the amount of         the surcharge.              l   In violations of traffic laws within the court s jurisdiction, the court may, in addition         to any other disposition, restrain the minor from driving for periods of time the court considers         necessary and take possession of the minor s driver license.  However, proceedings involving an         offense under Section     a     are governed by that section regarding suspension of driving         privileges.               m   i   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section              a     because of violating Section        , Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Drug Paraphernalia          Act, or Title   , Chapter   b, Imitation Controlled Substances Act, the court shall, in addition to          any fines or fees otherwise imposed, order that the minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no          more than     hours, of community service. Satisfactory completion of an approved substance          abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as community service hours.               ii   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section              a     because of a violation of Section   A        or Subsection            , the court may,          upon the first adjudication, and shall, upon a second or subsequent adjudication, order that the          minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no more than     hours of community service, in          addition to any fines or fees otherwise imposed.  Satisfactory completion of an approved substance          abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as community service hours.               n   The court may order that the minor be examined or treated by a physician, surgeon,          psychiatrist, or psychologist or that he receive other special care.  For these purposes the court may          place the minor in a hospital or other suitable facility.               o   i   The court may appoint a guardian for the minor if it appears necessary in the interest          of the minor, and may appoint a public or private institution or agency as guardian in which legal          custody of the minor is vested.               ii   In placing a minor under the guardianship or legal custody of an individual or of a          private agency or institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the minor.           When practicable, the court may take into consideration the religious preferences of the minor and          of his parents.                       p   i   In support of a decree under Section     a    , the court may order reasonable         conditions to be complied with by the parents or guardian, the minor, his custodian, or any other         person who has been made a party to the proceedings.  Conditions may include               A   visitation by the parents or one parent               B   restrictions on the minor s associates               C   restrictions on the minor s occupation and other activities  and              D   requirements to be observed by the parents or custodian.              ii   A minor, whose parents or guardians successfully complete a family or other         counseling program, may be credited by the court for detention, confinement, or probation time.               q   The court may order the minor to be placed in the legal custody of the Division of          Mental Health or committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority, in          accordance with the procedures and requirements of Title   A, Chapter   , Part  A, Commitment          of Persons Under Age    to Division of Mental Health.               r   The court may make an order committing a minor within its jurisdiction to the Utah          State Developmental Center if the minor has been found mentally retarded in accordance with the          provisions of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Admission to Mental Retardation Facility.
