The court may not assess those fees or costs against a parent who is          found to be impecunious.                   An attorney guardian ad litem appointed under this section, when serving in the scope          of his duties as guardian ad litem is considered an employee of the state for purposes of          indemnification under Title   , Chapter   , Utah Governmental Immunity Act.                   a   An attorney guardian ad litem shall represent the best interest of a minor.

A difference between the minor s wishes and the          attorney s determination of best interest may not be considered a conflict of interest for the          attorney.               b   An attorney guardian ad litem  is responsible to  shall formulate an independent          position, after considering all relevant evidence, in accordance with the requirements of Subsection             .

This subsection supersedes Title   , Chapter  , Government Records          Access and Management Act.                      b   All records of an attorney guardian ad litem are subject to legislative subpoena, under         Title   , Chapter   , Legislative Subpoena Powers, and shall be released to the Legislature.              c   Records released in accordance with Subsection  b  shall be maintained as confidential         by the Legislature.  The Office of the Legislative Auditor General may, however, include summary         data and nonidentifying information in its audits and reports to the Legislature.              d   Because of the unique role of an attorney guardian ad litem described in Subsection            , and the state s role and responsibility to provide a guardian ad litem program and, as parens         patriae, to protect minors, Subsection  b  constitutes an exception to Rules of Professional         Conduct, Rule  . , as provided by Rule  .  b    .

The court is responsible for all costs resulting from the appointment of an attorney          guardian ad litem and shall use funds appropriated by the Legislature for the guardian ad litem          program to cover those costs.
