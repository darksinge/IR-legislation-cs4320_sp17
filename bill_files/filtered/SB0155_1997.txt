The attorney for the state        or the special prosecutor shall forward the request to the grand jury.                     c   When the attorney for the state or the special prosecutor is personally aware of substantial        and competent evidence negating the guilt of a subject or target that might reasonably be expected        to lead the grand jury not to indict, he shall present or otherwise disclose the evidence to the grand        jury before the grand jury is asked to indict that person.                 a   The managing judge has the contempt power and authority inherent in the court over        which he presides and as provided by statute.             b   When a witness in any proceeding before or ancillary to any grand jury appearance        refuses to comply with an order from the managing judge to testify or provide other information,        including any book, paper, document, record, recording, or other material without having a        recognized privilege, the attorney for the state or special prosecutor may apply to the managing        judge for an order directing the witness to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.             c   After submission of the application and a hearing at which the witness is entitled to be        represented by counsel, the managing judge may hold the witness in contempt and order that he be        confined, upon a finding that the refusal was not privileged.             d   A hearing may not be held under this part unless    hours notice is given to the witness        who has refused to comply with the order to testify or provide other information, except a witness        may be given a shorter notice if the managing judge upon a showing of special need so orders.             e   Any confinement for refusal to comply with an order to testify or produce other        information shall continue until the witness is willing to give the testimony or provide the        information.  A period of confinement may not exceed the term of the grand jury, including        extensions, before which the refusal to comply with the order occurred.  In any event the        confinement may not exceed one year.             f   A person confined under this subsection for refusal to testify or provide other information        concerning any transaction, set of transactions, event, or events may not be again confined under this        subsection or for criminal contempt for a subsequent refusal to testify or provide other information        concerning the same transaction, set of transactions, event, or events.             g   Any person confined under this section may be admitted to bail or released in accordance        with local procedures pending the determination of an appeal taken by him from the order of his                confinement unless the appeal affirmatively appears to be frivolous or taken for delay.
