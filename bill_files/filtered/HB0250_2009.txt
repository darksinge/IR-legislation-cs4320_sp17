The executive director may recover only the proportionate share of costs of any                            investigation and abatement performed under Section                  and this section from each                            responsible party, as provided in this section.                                     a   In apportioning responsibility for the investigation and abatement, or liability                            for the costs of the investigation and abatement, in any administrative proceeding or judicial                            action, the following standards apply                                  i   liability shall be apportioned in proportion to each responsible party s respective                             contribution to the release  and                                 ii   the apportionment of liability shall be based on equitable factors, including the                            quantity, mobility, persistence, and toxicity of hazardous materials contributed by a responsible                            party, and the comparative behavior of a responsible party in contributing to the release,                            relative to other responsible parties.                                 b   Liability may not be apportioned against a current or previous owner or operator                            who acquired or became the operator of the facility before March   ,     , who may otherwise                            be a responsible party but who did not know that any hazardous material which is the subject of                            a release was on, in, or at the facility prior to acquisition or operation of the facility, and the                            release is not the result of an act or omission of the current or previous owner or operator.                                 c   Liability may not  be apportioned against a current or previous owner or operator                            who acquired or became the operator of the facility on or after March   ,     , who may                            otherwise be a responsible party but who did not know and had no reason to know, after having                            taken all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the facility, consistent                            with good commercial or customary practice at the time of the purchase, that any hazardous                            material  which is the subject of a release was on, in, or at the facility prior to acquisition or                            operation of the facility, and the release is not the result of an act or omission of the current or                            previous owner or operator.                                    d   A responsible party who is not exempt under Subsection     b  or  c  may be                            considered to have contributed to the release and may be liable for a proportionate share of                            costs as provided under this section either by affirmatively causing a release or by failing to                            take action to prevent or abate a release which has originated at or from the facility.  A person                            whose property is contaminated by migration from an offsite release is not considered to have                            contributed to the release unless the person takes actions which exacerbate the release.                                 e   A responsible party who meets the criteria in Subsection     b  or  c  or a person                            who is not considered to have contributed to a release under Subsection     d  is not considered                            to have contributed to a release solely by failing to take abatement or remedial action pursuant                            to an administrative order.                                 f   i   The burden of proving proportionate contribution shall be borne by each                            responsible party.                                 ii   If a responsible party does not prove his proportionate contribution, the court or the                            executive director shall apportion liability to the party based solely on available evidence and                            the standards of Subsection     a .                                 iii   The ability of a responsible party to pay is not a factor in the apportionment of                            liability.                                 g   The court may not impose joint and several liability.                                 h   Each responsible party is strictly liable solely for his proportionate share of                            investigation and abatement costs.                                     The failure of the executive director to name all responsible parties is not a defense                            to an action under this section.                                     a   Any party who incurs costs under Section                  and this section in excess of                            his liability may seek contribution from any other party who is or may be liable under Section                                          and this section for the excess costs in the district court.                                 b   In resolving claims made under Subsection     a , the court shall allocate costs                            using the standards set forth in Subsection    .                                     a   A party who has resolved his liability in an agreement under Section                                            and this section is not liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the                            settlement.                                 b   i   An agreement does not discharge any of the liability of responsible parties who                               are not parties to the agreement, unless the terms of the agreement provide otherwise.                                 ii   An agreement made under this subsection reduces the potential liability of other                            responsible parties by the amount of the agreement.                                     a   If the executive director obtains less than complete relief from a party who has                            resolved his liability in an agreement under Section                  and this section, the executive                            director may bring an action against any party who has not resolved his liability in an                            agreement.                                 b   In apportioning liability, the standards of Subsection     apply.                                 c   A party who resolved his liability for some or all of the costs in an agreement under                            Section                  and this section may seek contribution from any person who is not party to an                            agreement under Section                  and this section.                                     a   An agreement made under Section                  and this section may provide that                            the executive director will pay for costs of actions that the parties have agreed to perform, but                            which the executive director has agreed to finance, under the agreement.                                 b   If the executive director makes payments from the fund, he may recover the amount                            paid using the authority of Section                  and this section or any other applicable authority.                                     a   The executive director may not recover costs of any investigation performed                            under the authority of Subsection                                    b  if the investigation does not                            confirm that a release presenting a direct and immediate threat to public health has occurred.                                 b   This subsection takes precedence over any conflicting provision of this section                            regarding cost recovery.
