An energy assessment lien under this section  a   is superior to the lien of a trust deed, mortgage, mechanic s or materialman s lien, orother encumbrances  b   has the same priority as, but is separate and distinct from  i   a lien for general property taxes  or ii   any other energy assessment lien levied under this chapter  c   applies to any reduced payment obligations without interruption, change in priority,or alteration in any manner  and d   continues until the assessment and any related reduced payment obligations,interest, penalties, and costs are paid, regardless of  i   a sale of the property for or on account of a delinquent general property tax, specialtax, or other assessment  or ii   the issuance of a tax deed, an assignment of interest by the county, or a sheriff scertificate of sale or deed.          a    .     a   In lieu of issuing energy assessment bonds to finance the costs of improvementsunder this chapter, a third party lender may provide financing to a property owner to finance,refinance, or reimburse the costs of improvements. b   A local entity, through the local entity s executive or administrator, as applicable,may assign to the third party lender described in Subsection     a  the local entity s rights in theenergy assessment lien by entering into a written agreement with the third party lender.     a   If a local entity assigns the local entity s rights in an energy assessment lien to athird party lender under Subsection    , the local entity s executive or administrator, asapplicable, may authorize the designation of the energy assessment area and the levying of theassessment in lieu of the adoption of an energy assessment resolution or ordinance by thegoverning body of the local entity under Section      a    . b   If a local entity assigns the local entity s rights under Subsection     b , the localentity shall ensure that the written agreement with the third party lender  i   includes the information required to be included within an energy assessmentresolution or ordinance described in Section      a      ii   complies with Section      a      iii   requires the third party lender to be subject to an audit by the state auditorregarding the assigned energy assessment lien  iv   requires the third party lender to submit to the local entity monthly reports,including information regarding the payments the third party lender receives  and v   insulates the local entity from liability for the actions of the third party lender.     If a local entity assigns an energy assessment lien to a third party lender, inaccordance with Subsection    , except as provided in Subsection      a       , thethird party lender has and possesses the same powers and rights at law or in equity to enforcethe lien that the local entity creating the lien would have if the local entity did not assign thelien, including the rights and powers of the local entity under Sections      a     and     a    .     a   Any financing in connection with the assignment of an energy assessment liento a third party lender under this section is not  i   an obligation of the local entity that assigns the lien  or ii   a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of the local entity that assignsthe lien. b   A local entity may not obligate itself to pay any assessment levied or bond issuedunder this chapter. c   The assessments and the property upon which the energy assessment lien isrecorded are the sole securities for the assignment of an energy assessment lien.          a    .     If an assessment or an installment of an assessment is not paid when due, the localentity may sell the property on which the assessment has been levied for the amount due plusinterest, penalties, and costs  a   in the manner provided in Title   , Chapter  , Part   , Collection of Taxes, for thesale of property for delinquent general property taxes  b   by judicial foreclosure  or c   in the manner provided in Title   , Chapter  , Conveyances, as though the propertywere the subject of a trust deed in favor of the local entity if the owner of record of the propertyat the time the local entity initiates the process to sell the property in accordance with Title   ,Chapter  , Conveyances, has executed a property owner s consent form that  i   estimates the total assessment to be levied against the particular parcel of property  ii   describes any additional benefits that the local entity expects the assessed propertyto receive from the improvements  iii   designates the date and time by which the fully executed consent form is requiredto be submitted to the local entity  and iv   A   appoints a trustee that satisfies the requirements described in Section          B   gives the trustee the power of sale  and C   explains that if an assessment or an installment of an assessment is not paid whendue, the local entity may sell the property owner s property to satisfy the amount due plusinterest, penalties, and costs, in the manner described in Title   , Chapter  , Conveyances.     If the local entity has assigned the local entity s rights to a third party lender underSection      a    , the local entity shall provide written instructions to the third party lenderas to which method of enforcement the third party lender shall pursue.     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each tax sale under Subsection     b is governed by Title   , Chapter  , Part   , Collection of Taxes, to the same extent as if thesale were for the sale of property for delinquent general property taxes.     a   In a foreclosure under Subsection     c   i   the local entity may bid at the sale  ii   if no one bids at the sale and pays the local entity the amount due on theassessment, plus interest and costs, the property is considered sold to the local entity for thoseamounts  and iii   the local entity s chief financial officer may substitute and appoint one or moresuccessor trustees, as provided in Section        . b   i   The local entity shall disclose the designation of a trustee under Subsection    a  ii  in the notice of default that the trustee gives to commence the foreclosure. ii   The local entity is not required to disclose the designation of a trustee underSubsection     a  ii  in an instrument separate from the notice described in Subsection    b  i .     a   The redemption of property that is the subject of a tax sale under Subsection    b  is governed by Title   , Chapter  , Part   , Collection of Taxes. b   The redemption of property that is the subject of a foreclosure proceeding underSubsection     c  is governed by Title   , Chapter  , Conveyances.     The remedies described in this part for the collection of an assessment and theenforcement of an energy assessment lien are cumulative, and the use of one or more of thoseremedies does not deprive the local entity of any other available remedy, means of collectingthe assessment, or means of enforcing the energy assessment lien.          a    .     If an assessment is payable in installments and a default occurs in the payment of aninstallment when due  a   the local entity may  i   declare the delinquent amount to be immediately due and subject to collection asprovided in this chapter  ii   if the financed improvements are not completed by the completion deadline towhich the property owner agreed in the bond or financing documents, then within    days afterthe completion deadline, accelerate payment of the total unpaid balance of the assessment anddeclare the whole of the unpaid principal and the interest then due to be immediately due andpayable  and iii   charge and collect all costs of collection, including attorney fees  and b   except as provided in Subsection     a  ii , the local entity may not acceleratepayment of the total unpaid balance of the assessment.     Delinquency interest accrues from the date of delinquency on all applicableamounts described in Subsection     a  until the property owner pays the delinquency in full.     A local entity shall ensure that any interest that the local entity assesses under thissection and any collection costs that the local entity charges under this section are the same asfor delinquent real property taxes for the year in which the balance of the fee or chargebecomes delinquent unless the local entity determines otherwise.     Notwithstanding Subsection    , a property owner may regain the right to pay anassessment in installments as if no default had occurred if the owner pays the amount of allunpaid installments that are past due with interest, collection and foreclosure costs, andadministrative, redemption, and other fees, including attorney fees, before  a   the final date that payment may be legally made under a final sale or foreclosure ofproperty to collect delinquent assessment installments, if the governing body enforcescollection under Title   , Chapter  , Part   , Collection of Taxes  or b   the end of the three month reinstatement period provided in Section        , if thegoverning body enforces collection through the method of foreclosing trust deeds.          a    .     a   Upon payment in full of an assessment on a parcel of property, the local entityor third party lender, in the event the local entity has assigned the energy assessment lien to thethird party lender, shall file a release and discharge of the energy assessment lien on theproperty in the office of the recorder of the county where the property is located. b   The local entity or third party lender shall ensure that each release and dischargeunder Subsection     a   i   includes a legal description of the affected property  and ii   complies with other applicable requirements for recording a document.     a   Upon payment in full of all assessments levied within an energy assessmentarea, or upon providing for payment in full, the local entity or third party lender, in the eventthe local entity has assigned the energy assessment lien to the third party lender, shall file anotice of the dissolution of the energy assessment area in the office of the recorder of thecounty where the property within the energy assessment area is located. b   The local entity or third party lender shall ensure that each notice under Subsection    a   i   includes a legal description of the property assessed within the energy assessmentarea  and ii   complies with all other applicable requirements for recording a document.          a    .     A local entity may, subject to the requirements of this chapter, authorize theissuance of a bond to pay, refinance, or reimburse the costs of improvements in an energyassessment area, and other related costs, against the funds that the local entity will receivebecause of an assessment in an energy assessment area.     A local entity may, by resolution or ordinance, delegate to one or more officers ofthe issuer the authority to  a   in accordance with the parameters in the resolution or ordinance, approve the finalinterest rate or rates, price, principal amount, maturity or maturities, redemption features, andother terms of the bond  and b   approve and execute all documents relating to the issuance of a bond.     The aggregate principal amount of a bond authorized under Subsection     may notexceed  a   the unpaid balance of assessments at the time the bond is issued  or b   if the property owner incurred the costs of improvements to be refinanced orreimbursed no earlier than three years before the date of issuance of the energy assessmentbond, the total costs of the improvements to be refinanced or reimbursed.     The issuer of an energy assessment bond issued under this section shall ensure that  a   the energy assessment bond  i   is fully negotiable for all purposes  ii   matures at a time that does not exceed the period that installments of assessmentsin the assessment area are due and payable, plus one year  iii   bears interest at the lowest rate or rates reasonably obtainable  iv   is issued in registered form as provided in Title   , Chapter  , Registered PublicObligations Act  v   provides that interest be paid semiannually, annually, or at another interval asspecified by the governing body  and vi   is not dated earlier than the effective date of the assessment ordinance  and b   the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bond defines the place where the bondis payable, the form of the bond, and the manner in which the bond is sold.     a   A local entity may  i   A   provide that an energy assessment bond may be called for redemption beforematurity  and B   fix the terms and conditions of redemption, including the notice to be given andany premium to be paid  ii   subject to Subsection     b , require an energy assessment bond to bear interest at afixed or variable rate, or a combination of fixed and variable rates  iii   specify the terms and conditions under which  A   an energy assessment bond bearing interest at a variable interest rate may beconverted to bear interest at a fixed interest rate  and B   the local entity agrees to repurchase the bonds  iv   engage a remarketing agent and indexing agent, subject to the terms and conditionsto which the governing body agrees  and v   include all costs associated with an energy assessment bond, including any costsresulting from any of the actions the local entity is authorized to take under this section, in anassessment levied under Section      a    . b   If an energy assessment bond carries a variable interest rate, the local entity shallspecify  i   the basis upon which the variable rate is to be determined over the life of the bond  ii   the manner in which and schedule upon which the rate is to be adjusted  and iii   a maximum rate that the bond may carry.     A local entity may only use the proceeds of an energy assessment bond to refinanceor reimburse costs of improvements authorized under this chapter if the property ownerincurred the costs no earlier than three years before the date of issuance of the energyassessment bond.          a    .     a   An energy assessment bond that a local entity issues under this chapter  i   is a limited obligation of the local entity  and ii   does not constitute nor give rise to  A   a general obligation or liability of the local entity or the state  or B   a charge against the general credit or taxing powers of the local entity or the state. b   The local entity shall ensure that the limitation described in Subsection     a  isplainly stated upon the face of the bond. c   The assessments and the property upon which the energy assessment lien isrecorded are the sole securities for an energy assessment bond.     a   A local entity that issues an energy assessment bond is not liable and may notobligate itself for payment of the bond, except for a fund that the local entity creates andreceives from assessments against which the bond is issued. b   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, a local entity that issues an energyassessment bond is responsible for  i   the lawful levy of all assessments  and ii   the faithful accounting, collection, settlement, and payment of assessments.          a    .     A local entity may, by a resolution adopted by the governing body, authorize theissuance of a refunding assessment bond as provided in this section, to repay prior bonds inwhole or in part, whether at or before the maturity of the prior bonds, at stated maturity, uponredemption, or upon declaration of maturity.     a   Subject to Subsection     b , the issuance of a refunding assessment bond isgoverned by Title   , Chapter   , Utah Refunding Bond Act. b   If there is a conflict between a provision of Title   , Chapter   , Utah RefundingBond Act, and a provision of this part, the provision of this part governs.     In issuing a refunding assessment bond, the local entity shall require the refundingassessment bond and interest on the bond to be payable from and secured, to the extent theprior bonds were payable from and secured, by  a   the same assessments  or b   the reduced assessments adopted by the governing body under Section      a    .     A refunding assessment bond  a   is payable solely from the sources described in Subsection      b   matures no later than one year after the date of final maturity of the prior bonds  c   does not mature at a time or bear interest at a rate that will cause the local entity tobe unable to pay the bond when due from the sources listed in Subsection      d   bears interest as the governing body determines and subject to the provisionsrelating to interest in Section      a      and e   pays one or more issues of the issuing local entity s prior bonds.     If the bond refunds two or more issues of a local entity s prior bonds, the localentity may issue the bond in one or more series.          a    .     Each local entity that issues a refunding assessment bond shall adopt a resolution orordinance amending the previously adopted energy assessment resolution or ordinance that  a   reduces, as determined by the local entity s governing body  i   the assessments levied under the previous resolution or ordinance  ii   the interest payable on the assessments levied under the previous resolution orordinance  or iii   both the assessments levied under the previous resolution or ordinance and theinterest payable on those assessments  b   allocates the reductions under Subsection     a  so the then unpaid assessmentslevied against benefitted property within the assessment area and the unpaid interest on thoseassessments receive a proportionate share of the reductions  c   states the amounts of the reduced payment obligation for each property assessed inthe prior resolution or ordinance  and d   states the effective date of any reduction in the assessment levied in the priorresolution or ordinance.     In a resolution or ordinance described in Subsection    , the local entity is notrequired to describe each block, lot, part of a block or lot, tract, or parcel of property assessed.     The local entity shall ensure that each reduction under Subsection     a  is equal tothe amount by which the principal, interest, or combined principal and interest payable on therefunding assessment bond, after accounting for incidental refunding costs associated with therefunding assessment bond, is less than the amount of principal, interest, or combined principaland interest payable on the prior bonds.     A reduction under Subsection     a  does not apply to an assessment or interestpaid before the reduction.     A resolution or ordinance under Subsection     may not become effective beforethe date when any principal, interest, redemption premium on the prior bonds, and advancesunder Subsection              a  are fully paid or legally considered to be paid.     Except for the amount of reduction to a prior assessment or interest on a priorassessment, neither the issuance of a refunding assessment bond nor the adoption of aresolution or ordinance under Subsection     affects  a   the validity or continued enforceability of a prior assessment or interest on theassessment  or b   the validity, enforceability, or priority of an energy assessment lien.     Each reduction of a prior assessment and the interest on the assessment continues toexist in favor of the refunding assessment bonds.     Even after payment in full of the prior bonds that a refunding assessment bondrefunds, an energy assessment lien continues to exist to secure payment of  a   the reduced payment obligations  b   the penalties and costs of collection of those obligations  and c   the refunding assessment bond.     A lien securing a reduced payment obligation from which a refunding assessmentbond is payable and by which the bond is secured is subordinate to an energy assessment lienthat secures the original or prior assessment and prior bonds until the prior bonds are paid infull or legally considered to be paid in full.      Unless prior bonds are paid in full simultaneously with the issuance of a refundingassessment bond, the local entity shall  a   irrevocably set aside the proceeds of the refunding assessment bond in an escrow orother separate account  and b   pledge the account described in Subsection      a  as security for the payment ofthe prior bonds, the refunding assessment bond, or both.      This part applies to any refunding assessment bond  a   regardless of whether the local entity already issued the bond  and b   regardless of whether the local entity issued the prior bonds that the bond refundedunder prior law and regardless of whether that law is currently in effect.      a   Subsection   J      .      is repealed July  ,     . b   When repealing Subsection   J      .     , the Office of Legislative Research andGeneral Counsel shall, in addition to the office s authority under Subsection            , makenecessary changes to subsection numbering and cross references.

In a resolution or ordinance described in Subsection    , the local entity is not         required to describe each block, lot, part of a block or lot, tract, or parcel of property assessed.                   The local entity shall ensure that each reduction under Subsection     a  is equal to         the amount by which the principal, interest, or combined principal and interest payable on the         refunding assessment bond, after accounting for incidental refunding costs associated with the         refunding assessment bond, is less than the amount of principal, interest, or combined principal         and interest payable on the prior bonds.                   A reduction under Subsection     a  does not apply to an assessment or interest         paid before the reduction.                   A resolution or ordinance under Subsection     may not become effective before         the date when any principal, interest, redemption premium on the prior bonds, and advances         under Subsection              a  are fully paid or legally considered to be paid.                   Except for the amount of reduction to a prior assessment or interest on a prior         assessment, neither the issuance of a refunding assessment bond nor the adoption of a         resolution or ordinance under Subsection     affects                a   the validity or continued enforceability of a prior assessment or interest on the         assessment  or               b   the validity, enforceability, or priority of an energy assessment lien.

Even after payment in full of the prior bonds that a refunding assessment bond         refunds, an energy assessment lien continues to exist to secure payment of                a   the reduced payment obligations                b   the penalties and costs of collection of those obligations  and               c   the refunding assessment bond.                   A lien securing a reduced payment obligation from which a refunding assessment         bond is payable and by which the bond is secured is subordinate to an energy assessment lien         that secures the original or prior assessment and prior bonds until the prior bonds are paid in         full or legally considered to be paid in full.                    Unless prior bonds are paid in full simultaneously with the issuance of a refunding         assessment bond, the local entity shall                a   irrevocably set aside the proceeds of the refunding assessment bond in an escrow or         other separate account  and               b   pledge the account described in Subsection      a  as security for the payment of         the prior bonds, the refunding assessment bond, or both.                    This part applies to any refunding assessment bond                a   regardless of whether the local entity already issued the bond  and               b   regardless of whether the local entity issued the prior bonds that the bond refunded         under prior law and regardless of whether that law is currently in effect.
