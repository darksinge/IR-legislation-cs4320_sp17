Administrative Rules Review Committee.                   a   There is created an Administrative Rules Review Committee of  six  ten permanent          members and four ex officio members.               b   i   The committee s permanent members shall be composed of  three  five members          of the Senate, appointed by the president of the Senate, and  three  five members of the House,          appointed by the speaker of the House, with no more than  two  three senators and  two  three          representatives from the same political party.               ii   The permanent members shall convene as a committee to review new agency rules,          amendments to existing agency rules, and repeals of existing agency rules.               iii   Members shall serve for two year terms or until their successors are appointed.               iv   A vacancy exists whenever a committee member ceases to be a member of the          Legislature, or when a member resigns from the committee. Vacancies shall be filled by the           appointing authority, and the replacement shall serve out the unexpired term.              c   When the committee reviews existing rules, the committee s permanent members shall         invite the Senate and House chairmen of the standing committee and the Senate and House         chairmen of the appropriation subcommittee that have jurisdiction over the agency whose existing         rules are being reviewed to participate as nonvoting, ex officio members with the committee.              d   Two representatives and two senators from the permanent members are a quorum for         the transaction of business at any meeting.                  Each agency rule as defined in Section      a   shall be submitted to the committee         at the same time public notice is given under Section      a  .                   a   The committee shall exercise continuous oversight of the process of rulemaking.               b   The committee shall examine rules submitted by each agency to determine                i   whether or not they are authorized by statute                ii   whether or not they comply with legislative intent                iii   their impact on the economy and the government operations of the state and local          political subdivisions  and               iv   their impact on affected persons.               c   To carry out these duties, the committee may examine any other issues that it considers          necessary.  The committee may also notify and refer rules to the chairmen of the interim          committee which has jurisdiction over a particular agency when the committee determines that an          issue involved in an agency s rules may be more appropriately addressed by that committee.               d   In reviewing the rules, the committee shall follow generally accepted principles of          statutory construction.                   The committee may request that the Office of the Legislative Fiscal Analyst prepare          a fiscal note on any rule.                   In order to accomplish its oversight functions, the committee has all the powers granted          to legislative interim committees as set forth in Section         .                   a   The committee may prepare written findings of its review of each rule and may          include any recommendations, including legislative action.               b   The committee shall provide to the agency that enacted the rule                i   a copy of its findings, if any  and               ii   a request that the agency notify the committee of any changes it makes in the rule.                      c   The committee shall provide a copy of its findings to any member of the Legislature         and to any person affected by the rule who requests a copy.              d   The committee shall provide a copy of its findings to the presiding officers of both the         House and the Senate, Senate and House chairmen of the standing committee, and the Senate and         House chairmen of the Appropriation Subcommittee that have jurisdiction over the agency whose         rules are the subject of the findings.                  a   The committee may submit a report on its review of state agency rules to each         member of the Legislature at each regular session.              b   The report shall include                i   the findings and recommendations made by the committee under Subsection                    ii   any action taken by an agency in response to committee recommendations  and               iii   any recommendations by the committee for legislation.              Section  .  Section       a   .  is amended to read                     a   . .  Legislative reauthorization of agency rules    Extension of rules by           governor.                   All grants of rulemaking power from the Legislature to a state agency in any statute          are made subject to the provisions of this section.                   a   Except as provided in Subsection  b , every agency rule that is in effect on January            of any calendar year expires on May   of that year unless it has been reauthorized by the          Legislature during its annual general session.               b   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection      a , an agency s rules do not expire          if                i   the rule is explicitly mandated by a federal law or regulation  or               ii   a provision of Utah s constitution vests the agency with specific constitutional          authority to regulate.                   a   Prior to January   of each year, the Administrative Rules Review Committee shall          have omnibus legislation prepared for consideration by the Legislature during its annual general          session.               b   The omnibus legislation shall be substantially in the following form   All rules of Utah          state agencies are reauthorized except for the following  .               c   Before sending the legislation to the governor for his action, the Administrative Rules                 Review Committee  shall  may send a letter to the governor and to the agency explaining         specifically why the committee believes any rule should not be reauthorized.                  The Legislature s reauthorization of a rule by legislation does not constitute legislative         approval of the rule, nor is it admissible in any proceeding as evidence of legislative intent.                  a   If an agency believes that a rule that has not been reauthorized by the Legislature         or that will be allowed to expire should continue in full force and effect and is a rule within their         authorized rulemaking power, the agency may seek the governor s declaration extending the rule         beyond the expiration date.              b   In seeking the extension, the agency shall submit a petition to the governor that          affirmatively states                i   that the rule is necessary  and               ii   a citation to the source of its authority to make the rule.               c   i   If the governor finds that the necessity does exist, and that the agency has the          authority to make the rule, he may declare the rule to be extended by publishing that declaration          in the Administrative Rules Bulletin on or before April    of that year.               ii   The declaration shall set forth the rule to be extended, the reasons the extension is          necessary, and a citation to the source of the agency s authority to make the rule.               d   If the omnibus bill required by Subsection     fails to pass both houses of the          Legislature, the governor may declare all rules to be extended by publishing a single declaration          in the Administrative Rules Bulletin on or before April    without meeting requirements of          Subsections  b  and  c .      Legislative Review Note      as of                  AM    A limited legal review of this bill raises no obvious constitutional or statutory concerns.
