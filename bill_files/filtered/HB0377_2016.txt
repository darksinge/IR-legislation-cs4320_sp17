As used in this section              a    Grandparent  means an individual              i   whose child, either by blood, marriage, or adoption, has had the child s parental       rights terminated under Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act  and             ii   whose grandchild is being adopted by a relative.             b    Nonrelative  means an individual not related to the grandchild by marriage or       blood at the time of adoption.             c    Relative  means an individual related to the grandchild by marriage or blood as              i   a sibling              ii   an aunt              iii   an uncle  or             iv   a grandparent.                 Unless the grandchild is adopted by a nonrelative, when a parent s rights are       terminated under Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act              a   the rights of a grandparent of a grandchild are not extinguished  and             b   a grandparent may file a petition for visitation rights in juvenile or district court.                 a   There is a rebuttable presumption that the adoptive parent s decision with regard       to grandparent visitation is in the grandchild s best interest.             b   The court may override the adoptive parent s decision described in Subsection           a  and grant the petitioner reasonable rights of visitation if the court finds that the petitioner       has rebutted the presumption based upon factors that the court considers to be relevant, such as       whether              i   the petitioner is a fit and proper individual to have visitation with the grandchild              ii   visitation with the grandchild has been unfairly denied or unreasonably limited, and       without just or compelling cause              iii   the petitioner has acted as the grandchild s custodian or caregiver, or otherwise has       had a substantial and positive, bonding relationship with the grandchild, and the loss or       cessation of that relationship is likely to cause harm to the grandchild              iv   visitation will not disrupt the formation of a new family unit  or             v   visitation is in the best interest of the grandchild.                 Subject to the provisions of Subsection    , the court may inquire of the grandchild       and take into account the grandchild s desires regarding grandparent visitation.                 On the petition of a grandparent or the adoptive parent of the grandchild, the court       may, after a hearing, modify an order regarding grandparent visitation if              a   the circumstances of the grandchild, the grandparent, or the adoptive parent have       materially and substantially changed since the entry of the order to be modified, or the order       has become unworkable or inappropriate under existing circumstances  and             b   the court determines that a modification is appropriate based upon the factors set       forth in Subsection    .                 A grandparent may petition the court to remedy an adoptive parent s wrongful       noncompliance with a visitation order.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
