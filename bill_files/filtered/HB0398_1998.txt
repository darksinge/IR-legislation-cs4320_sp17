As used in this section,  viatical settlement  means a written contract entered into by          a member who may designate a beneficiary for any benefit under this title or who is the          policyholder of a life insurance policy insuring the life of the terminally ill member, under which          the member assigns, transfers ownership, irrevocably designates a specific person, or otherwise          alienates all control and right in the benefit or the insurance policy to another person, when the          proceeds of the contract is paid to the member or the member s designee prior to the death of the          member.                         If a member marries or remarries, all beneficiary designations dated prior to the          most recent marriage and filed with the retirement office shall be cancelled and the spouse shall          be the beneficiary unless a different beneficiary designation is executed on or after the date of the           marriage and filed with the retirement office, in which case the designation of beneficiary shall be         binding in the payment of any benefits which may be due under this title.                        A member may revoke a designation of beneficiary at any time and may file a         different beneficiary designation by executing and filing with the retirement office a written         beneficiary designation on forms provided by the retirement office, except where an optional         continuing plan is chosen, or the law makes a specific benefit designation to a dependent spouse,         in which case the beneficiary designation may not be revoked.                        If no beneficiary is designated or if the estate is the named beneficiary and if a         deceased member does not leave an estate requiring probate in the absence of the amounts due          from the retirement system, unless otherwise provided in this title, all benefits payable from the          retirement system, including retirement benefits accrued but not received prior to death, may be          paid or applied to the benefit of the surviving next of kin of the deceased in the order of precedence          established under Title   , Chapter  ,  the Utah Uniform Probate Code  Intestate Succession and          Wills.                         No payment may be made to persons included in any of these groups if at the date          of payment there are living persons in any of the groups preceding it.

If the location of the nominated beneficiary cannot be ascertained or if the          nominated beneficiary is the estate of the deceased person, the administrator may pay the costs of          the deceased s last illness, convalescent care, and funeral expenses directly to the undertaking          establishment, hospital, doctor, or convalescent home which provided the service.  The          administrator shall require verified statements of the charges before making partial or full payment.           The payment shall discharge the obligation of the system and of the fund up to the amount paid.                    a   Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, a member may make an          irrevocable viatical settlement for any benefit under this title, including any life insurance policy,                 for which the member may designate a beneficiary.              b   A person may enforce payment of proceeds from an interest obtained under a viatical         settlement.
