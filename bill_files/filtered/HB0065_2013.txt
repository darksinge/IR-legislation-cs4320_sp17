A decree of separation that does not terminate the                           status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.                                   c    Divorced individual  includes an individual whose marriage has been annulled.                                d    Governing instrument  means a governing instrument executed by the divorced                           individual before the divorce or annulment of  his  the individual s marriage to  his  the                          individual s former spouse.                                e    Relative of the divorced individual s former spouse  means an individual who is                           related to the divorced individual s former spouse by blood, adoption, or affinity and who, after                           the divorce or annulment, is not related to the divorced individual by blood, adoption, or                           affinity.                                f    Revocable,  with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision, or nomination,                           means one under which the divorced individual, at the time of the divorce or annulment, was                           alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the designation in favor                           of  his  the individual s former spouse or former spouse s relative, whether or not the divorced                           individual was then empowered to designate  himself  another in place of  his  the individual s                           former spouse or in place of  his  the individual s former spouse s relative and whether or not                           the divorced individual then had the capacity to exercise the power.

A severance under Subsection     b  does not affect any third party interest in                           property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the                           survivor of the former spouses unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted,                            registered, filed, or recorded in records appropriate to the kind and location of the property,                            which are relied upon, in the ordinary course of transactions involving such property, as                            evidence of ownership.                                           Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse                            and relatives of the former spouse disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the                            case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the former spouse                            and relatives of the former spouse died immediately before the divorce or annulment.                                           Provisions revoked solely by this section are revived by the divorced                            individual s remarriage to the former spouse or by a nullification of the divorce or annulment.                                           No change of circumstances other than as described in this section and in                            Section                  effects a revocation.                                           a   A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or                            transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing                            instrument affected by a divorce, annulment, or remarriage, or for having taken any other                            action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument, before the payor or                            other third party received written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage.  A payor or                            other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third                            party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.                                 b   Written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage under Subsection                                     a  shall be mailed to the payor s or other third party s main office or home by registered or                            certified mail, return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the                               same manner as a summons in a civil action.  Upon receipt of written notice of the divorce,                            annulment, or remarriage, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or                            deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate                            proceedings relating to the decedent s estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or                            with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to the decedent s estates                            located in the county of the decedent s residence.  The court shall hold the funds or item of                            property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement or transfer in                            accordance with the determination.  Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court                            discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or                            items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.                                           a   A person who purchases property from a former spouse, relative of a                            former spouse, or any other person for value and without notice, or who receives from a former                            spouse, relative of a former spouse, or any other person a payment or other item of property in                            partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation, is neither obligated under this                            section to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, nor is liable under this section for                            the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit.  But a former spouse,                            relative of a former spouse, or other person who, not for value, received a payment, item of                            property, or any other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated                            to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the                            payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under                            this section.                                 b   If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to                            a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered by this section, a former spouse,                            relative of the former spouse, or any other person who, not for value, received a payment, item                            of property, or any other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is                            obligated to return that payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the                            amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who would                            have been entitled to it were this section or part of this section not preempted.
