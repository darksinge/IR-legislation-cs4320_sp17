In order to further the state policy of securing the maximum use and benefit of its                            scarce water resources, a person entitled to the use of water has a continuing obligation to place                            all of a water right to beneficial use.  The forfeiture of all or part of any right to use water for                            failure to place all or part of the water to beneficial use makes possible the allocation and use                            of water consistent with long established beneficial use concepts.  The provisions of                            Subsections     through     shall be construed to carry out the purposes and policies set forth in                            this Subsection    .

years, the water right or the                            unused portion of that water right ceases and the water reverts to the public, unless, before the                            expiration of the five year period, the appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest                            files a verified nonuse application with the state engineer.                                 b   i   A nonuse application may be filed on all or a portion of the water right,                            including water rights held by mutual irrigation companies.                                 ii   Public water supply entities that own stock in a mutual water company, after giving                            written notice to the water company, may file nonuse applications with the state engineer on                            the water represented by the stock.                                 c   i   A water right or a portion of the water right may not be forfeited unless a judicial                            action to declare the right forfeited is commenced within    years from the end of the latest                            period of nonuse of at least five years.

served upon each claimant.                                 iii   A decree entered in an action for general determination of rights under Chapter  ,                            Determination of Water Rights, shall bar any claim of forfeiture for prior nonuse against any                            right determined to be valid in the decree, but shall not bar a claim for periods of nonuse that                            occur after the entry of the decree.                                 iv   A proposed determination by the state engineer in an action for general                            determination of rights under Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights, shall bar any claim of                            forfeiture for prior nonuse against any right proposed to be valid, unless a timely objection has                            been filed within the time allowed in Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights.                                 d   The extension of time to resume the use of that water may not exceed five years                            unless the time is further extended by the state engineer.                                    e   The provisions of this section

with the knowledge of the water right holder, provided that the use of water pursuant to a lease                            or other agreement with the appropriator or the appropriator s successor shall be considered to                            constitute beneficial use.                                 f   The provisions of this section shall not apply                                  i   to those periods of time when a surface water source fails to yield sufficient water to                            satisfy the water right, or when groundwater is not available because of a sustained drought                                  ii   to water stored in reservoirs pursuant to an existing water right, where the stored                            water is being held in storage for present

groundwater.                                     a   The state engineer shall furnish an application requiring the following                            information                                  i
