The department, upon order of the court, shall collect and disburse fines, restitution         with interest in accordance with Subsection            , and any other costs assessed under         Section          during               a   the parole period and any extension of that period in accordance with Subsection                     and              b   the probation period in cases for which the court orders supervised probation and any         extension of that period by the department in accordance with Subsection            .                   a   i   Probation may be terminated at any time at the discretion of the court or upon         completion without violation of    months probation in felony or class A misdemeanor cases, or             months in cases of class B or C misdemeanors or infractions.               ii   If the defendant, upon expiration or termination of the probation period, owes          outstanding fines, restitution, or other assessed costs, the court may retain jurisdiction of the case          and continue the defendant on bench probation or place the defendant on bench probation for the          limited purpose of enforcing the payment of fines, restitution, including interest, if any, in          accordance with Subsection            , and other amounts outstanding.               iii   Upon motion of the prosecutor or victim, or upon its own motion, the court may          require the defendant to show cause why his failure to pay should not be treated as contempt of          court or why the suspended jail or prison term should not be imposed.               b   The department shall notify the sentencing court and prosecuting attorney in writing          in advance in all cases when termination of supervised probation will occur by law.  The          notification shall include a probation progress report and complete report of details on outstanding          fines, restitution, and other amounts outstanding.                    a   i   Any time served by a probationer outside of confinement after having been          charged with a probation violation and prior to a hearing to revoke probation does not constitute          service of time toward the total probation term unless the probationer is exonerated at a hearing          to revoke the probation.               ii   Any time served in confinement awaiting a hearing or decision concerning revocation          of probation does not constitute service of time toward the total probation term unless the          probationer is exonerated at the hearing.               b   The running of the probation period is tolled upon the filing of a violation report with          the court alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of probation or upon the issuance of an                  order to show cause or warrant by the court.                   a   i   Probation may not be modified or extended except upon waiver of a hearing         by the probationer or upon a hearing and a finding in court that the probationer has violated the         conditions of probation.              ii   Probation may not be revoked except upon a hearing in court and a finding that the         conditions of probation have been violated.              b   i   Upon the filing of an affidavit alleging with particularity facts asserted to constitute         violation of the conditions of probation, the court that authorized probation shall determine if the         affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or extension of          probation is justified.               ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the          defendant a warrant for his arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show cause why his          probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.               c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall be          served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.               ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.               iii   The order to show cause shall inform the defendant of a right to be represented by          counsel at the hearing and to have counsel appointed for him if he is indigent.               iv   The order shall also inform the defendant of a right to present evidence.               d   i   At the hearing, the defendant shall admit or deny the allegations of the affidavit.               ii   If the defendant denies the allegations of the affidavit, the prosecuting attorney shall          present evidence on the allegations.               iii   The persons who have given adverse information on which the allegations are based          shall be presented as witnesses subject to questioning by the defendant unless the court for good          cause otherwise orders.               iv   The defendant may call witnesses, appear and speak in his own behalf, and present          evidence.               e   i   After the hearing the court shall make findings of fact.               ii   Upon a finding that the defendant violated the conditions of probation, the court may          order the probation revoked, modified, continued, or that the entire probation term commence          anew.                       iii   If probation is revoked, the defendant shall be sentenced or the sentence previously         imposed shall be executed.                   Restitution imposed under this chapter and interest accruing in accordance with         Subsection             is considered a debt for willful and malicious injury for purposes of         exceptions listed to discharge in bankruptcy as provided in Title    U.S.C.A. Sec.    ,     .                   The court may order the defendant to commit himself to the custody of the Division         of Mental Health for treatment at the Utah State Hospital as a condition of probation or stay of         sentence, only after the superintendent of the Utah State Hospital or his designee has certified to         the court that                a   the defendant is appropriate for and can benefit from treatment at the state hospital                b   treatment space at the hospital is available for the defendant  and               c   persons described in Subsection   A           g  are receiving priority for treatment          over the defendants described in this Subsection     .                    Presentence investigation reports, including presentence diagnostic evaluations, are          classified protected in accordance with Title   , Chapter  , Government Records Access and          Management Act.  Notwithstanding Sections          and         , the State Records Committee          may not order the disclosure of a presentence investigation report.  Except for disclosure at the          time of sentencing pursuant to this section, the department may disclose the presentence          investigation only when                a   ordered by the court pursuant to Subsection                            b   requested by a law enforcement agency or other agency approved by the department          for purposes of supervision, confinement, and treatment of the offender                c   requested by the Board of Pardons and Parole                d   requested by the subject of the presentence investigation report or the subject s          authorized representative  or               e   requested by the victim of the crime discussed in the presentence investigation report          or the victim s authorized representative, provided that the disclosure to the victim shall include          only information relating to statements or materials provided by the victim, to the circumstances          of the crime including statements by the defendant, or to the impact of the crime on the victim or          the victim s household.                    a   The court shall consider home confinement as a condition of probation under the                  supervision of the department, except as provided in Sections          and         . .              b   The department shall establish procedures and standards for home confinement,         including electronic monitoring, for all individuals referred to the department in accordance with         Subsection     .                   a   If the court places the defendant on probation under this section, it may order the         defendant to participate in home confinement through the use of electronic monitoring as described         in this section until further order of the court.              b   The electronic monitoring shall alert the department and the appropriate law         enforcement unit of the defendant s whereabouts.               c   The electronic monitoring device shall be used under conditions which require                i   the defendant to wear an electronic monitoring device at all times  and               ii   that a device be placed in the home of the defendant, so that the defendant s compliance          with the court s order may be monitored.               d   If a court orders a defendant to participate in home confinement through electronic          monitoring as a condition of probation under this section, it shall                i   place the defendant on probation under the supervision of the Department of          Corrections                ii   order the department to place an electronic monitoring device on the defendant and          install electronic monitoring equipment in the residence of the defendant  and               iii   order the defendant to pay the costs associated with home confinement to the          department or the program provider.               e   The department shall pay the costs of home confinement through electronic monitoring          only for those persons who have been determined to be indigent by the court.               f   The department may provide the electronic monitoring described in this section either          directly or by contract with a private provider.              Section   .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Payment of restitution.                   When the Board of Pardons and Parole orders the release on parole of an inmate who          has been sentenced to make restitution pursuant to Section          or whom the board has          ordered to make restitution, and all or a portion of restitution is still owing, the board may establish          a schedule, including both complete and court ordered restitution, by which payment of the                  restitution shall be made, or order  community  compulsory or other service in lieu of or in         combination with restitution. In fixing the schedule and supervising the paroled offender s         performance, the board may consider the factors specified in Subsection            .                  The board may impose any court order for restitution and order that a defendant make         restitution in an amount not to exceed the pecuniary damages to the victim of the offense of which         the defendant has been convicted, the victim of any other criminal conduct admitted to by the         defendant to the sentencing court, or for conduct for which the defendant has agreed to make         restitution as part of a plea agreement, unless the board applying the criteria as set forth in         Subsection             determines that restitution is inappropriate.                   The board may also make orders of restitution for recovery of any or all costs incurred          by the Department of Corrections or the state or any other agency arising out of the defendant s          needs or conduct.                   If the defendant, upon termination of the parole period owes outstanding fines,          restitution, or other assessed costs, the matter shall be referred to the district court for civil          collection remedies.  The Board of Pardons and Parole shall forward a restitution order to the          sentencing court to be entered on the judgment docket.  The entry shall constitute a lien and is          subject to the same rules as a judgment for money in a civil judgment.              Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                    a    .  Adjudication of jurisdiction of juvenile court    Disposition of cases              Enumeration of possible court orders    Considerations of court.                   a   When a minor is found to come within the provisions of Section     a    , the          court shall so adjudicate.  The court shall make a finding of the facts upon which it bases its          jurisdiction over the minor.  However, in cases within the provisions of Subsection     a       ,          findings of fact are not necessary.               b   If the court adjudicates a minor for a crime of violence or an offense in violation of          Title   , Chapter   , Part  , Weapons, it shall order that notice of the adjudication be provided to          the school superintendent of the district in which the minor resides or attends school.  Notice shall          be made to the district superintendent within three days and shall include the specific offenses for          which the minor was adjudicated.                   Upon adjudication the court may make the following dispositions by court order                a   i   The court may place the minor on probation or under protective supervision in the                  minor s own home and upon conditions determined by the court, including  community          compulsory service as provided in Section         . .              ii   If the court orders probation, the court shall direct that notice of its order be provided         to designated persons in the local law enforcement agency and the school or transferee school, if         applicable, which the minor attends.  The designated persons may receive the information for         purposes of the minor s supervision and student safety.              iii   Any employee of the local law enforcement agency and the school which the minor         attends who discloses the court s order of probation is not               A   civilly liable except when the disclosure constitutes fraud or malice as provided in          Section          and               B   civilly or criminally liable except when the disclosure constitutes a knowing violation          of Section         .               b   The court may place the minor in the legal custody of a relative or other suitable          person, with or without probation or protective supervision, but the juvenile court may not assume          the function of developing foster home services.               c   i   The court may vest legal custody of the minor in the Division of Child and Family          Services, Division of Youth Corrections, or the Division of Mental Health, and may order the          Department of Human Services to provide dispositional recommendations and services.               ii   Minors who are committed to the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services          on grounds other than abuse or neglect are subject to the provisions of Title   , Chapter  a, Part           A and Title   A, Chapter  a, Part  A.               d   i   The court may commit the minor to the Division of Youth Corrections for secure          confinement.               ii   A minor under the jurisdiction of the court solely on the ground of abuse, neglect, or          dependency under Subsection     a        c  may not be committed to the Division of Youth          Corrections.               e   The court may commit the minor, subject to the court retaining continuing jurisdiction          over him, to the temporary custody of the Division of Youth Corrections for observation and          evaluation for a period not to exceed    days.               f   i   The court may commit the minor to a place of detention or an alternative to          detention for a period not to exceed    days subject to the court retaining continuing jurisdiction                  over the minor.               ii   Subsection     f  applies only to those minors adjudicated for an act which if         committed by an adult would be a criminal offense or for contempt of court under Section             a    .  This commitment may be stayed or suspended upon conditions ordered by the court.              g   The court may vest legal custody of an abused, neglected, or dependent minor in the         Division of Child and Family Services or any other appropriate person in accordance with the         requirements and procedures of Title   , Chapter  a, Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency         Proceedings.              h   The court may place the minor on a ranch or forestry camp, or similar facility for care          and also for work, if possible, if the person, agency, or association operating the facility has been          approved or has otherwise complied with all applicable state and local laws.  A minor placed in          a forestry camp or similar facility may be required to work on fire prevention, forestation and          reforestation, recreational works, forest roads, and on other works on or off the grounds of the          facility and may be paid wages, subject to the approval of and under conditions set by the court.               i   The court may order that the minor be required to repair, replace, or otherwise make          restitution for damage or loss caused by the minor s wrongful act, including costs of treatment as          stated in Section     a    , and may impose fines in limited amounts.               j   The court may issue orders necessary for the collection of restitution and fines ordered          by the court, including garnishments, wage withholdings, and executions.               k   i   The court may through its probation department encourage the development of          employment or work programs to enable minors to fulfill their obligations under Subsection     i           and for other purposes considered desirable by the court.               ii   Consistent with the order of the court, the probation officer may permit the minor          found to be within the jurisdiction of the court to participate in a program of work restitution or           community  compulsory service in lieu of paying part or all of the fine imposed by the court.  The          work restitution or  community  compulsory service permitted by the probation officer may not          affect the amount of the surcharge.               l   In violations of traffic laws within the court s jurisdiction, the court may, in addition          to any other disposition, restrain the minor from driving for periods of time the court considers          necessary and take possession of the minor s driver license.  However, proceedings involving an          offense under Section     a     are governed by that section regarding suspension of driving                  privileges.              m   i   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section             a     because of violating Section        , Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Drug Paraphernalia         Act, or Title   , Chapter   b, Imitation Controlled Substances Act, the court shall, in addition to         any fines or fees otherwise imposed, order that the minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no         more than     hours, of  community  compulsory service.  Satisfactory completion of an approved         substance abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as  community          compulsory service hours.              ii   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section              a     because of a violation of Section   A        or Subsection            , the court may,          upon the first adjudication, and shall, upon a second or subsequent adjudication, order that the          minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no more than     hours of  community  compulsory          service, in addition to any fines or fees otherwise imposed.  Satisfactory completion of an          approved substance abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as           community  compulsory service hours.               n   The court may order that the minor be examined or treated by a physician, surgeon,          psychiatrist, or psychologist or that he receive other special care.  For these purposes the court may          place the minor in a hospital or other suitable facility.               o   i   The court may appoint a guardian for the minor if it appears necessary in the interest          of the minor, and may appoint a public or private institution or agency as guardian in which legal          custody of the minor is vested.               ii   In placing a minor under the guardianship or legal custody of an individual or of a          private agency or institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the minor.           When practicable, the court may take into consideration the religious preferences of the minor and          of the minor s parents.               p   i   In support of a decree under Section     a    , the court may order reasonable          conditions to be complied with by the parents or guardian, the minor, the minor s custodian, or any          other person who has been made a party to the proceedings.

If the arrested minor is taken to a detention          facility, the formal referral shall be filed with the juvenile court within    hours, excluding          weekends and holidays.  There shall be no requirement to file a formal referral with the juvenile          court on an offense that would be a class B misdemeanor or less if committed by an adult.               b   When the court is informed by a peace officer or other person that a minor is or appears          to be within the court s jurisdiction, the probation department shall make a preliminary inquiry to          determine whether the interests of the public or of the minor require that further action be taken.               c   Based on the preliminary inquiry, the court may authorize the filing of or request that          the county attorney or district attorney as provided under Sections         and        .  file a          petition.

Section   .  Section          .  is amended to read                        . .  Compulsory service    Graffiti penalties.                   If an offender uses graffiti and is convicted under Section          or          for its          use, or adjudicated in the juvenile court under Section     a    , the court may, as a condition of          probation under Subsection           , in addition to the compensatory or general damage award          imposed pursuant to Section         , order the offender to clean up graffiti of his own and any          other at a time and place within the jurisdiction of the court.               a   For a first conviction or adjudication, the court may require the offender to clean up          graffiti for not less than eight hours.               b   For a second conviction or adjudication, the court may require the offender to clean          up graffiti for not less than    hours.                       c   For a third conviction or adjudication, the court may require the offender to clean up         graffiti for not less than    hours.                  Any  community  compulsory service of a person under the age of    years which is         required, under this section, may be performed in the presence, and under the direct supervision,         of the person s parent or legal guardian.  The person s parent or legal guardian shall report         completion of the order to the court.                  The offender convicted under Section         ,         , or          or adjudicated         under Section     a     or his parent or legal guardian, if applicable, shall be responsible for         removal costs as determined under Section         , unless waived by the court for good cause.

If a court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a parent has refused to comply          with the minimum amount of visitation ordered in a decree of divorce, the court shall order the          parent to                a   perform a minimum of    hours of  community  compulsory service  and               b   participate in workshops, classes, or individual counseling to educate the parent about          the importance of complying with the court order and providing a child a continuing relationship          with both parents.                   If a custodial parent is ordered to perform  community  compulsory service or undergo          court ordered education, there is a rebuttable presumption that the noncustodial parent be granted          visitation by the court to provide child care during the time the custodial parent is complying with           community  compulsory service or education in order to recompense him for visitation time          wrongfully denied by the custodial parent under the divorce decree.                   If a noncustodial parent is ordered to perform  community  compulsory service or          undergo court ordered education, the court shall attempt to schedule the  community  compulsory          service or education at times that will not interfere with the noncustodial parent s visitation with          the child.                   The person ordered to participate in court ordered education is responsible for expenses                  of workshops, classes, and individual counseling.                  If a court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an obligor, as defined in         Section        , has refused to pay child support as ordered by a court in accordance with Title           , Chapter   , Uniform Civil Liability for Support Act, the court shall order the obligor to               a   perform a minimum of      ten hours of  community  compulsory service  and              b   participate in workshops, classes, or individual counseling to educate the obligor about         the importance of complying with the court order and providing the children with a regular and         stable source of support.                  The obligor is responsible for the expenses of workshops, classes, and individual          counseling ordered by the court.                   If a court orders an obligor to perform  community  compulsory service or undergo          court ordered education, the court shall attempt to schedule the  community  compulsory service          or education at times that will not interfere with the obligor s visitation with the child.                   The sanctions that the court shall impose under this section do not prevent the court          from imposing other sanctions as provided in Section         .  or other provisions in this          chapter, or prevent any person from bringing a cause of action allowed under state or federal law.
