The division shall make rules establishing a point system as provided for in this                            Subsection    .                                 a   i   The division shall assign a number of points to each type of moving traffic                               violation as a measure of its seriousness.                                 ii   The points shall be based upon actual relationships between types of traffic                            violations and motor vehicle traffic accidents.                                 b   Every person convicted of a traffic violation shall have assessed against his driving                            record the number of points that the division has assigned to the type of violation of which the                            person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be decreased by                                if on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded the severity of                            violation as minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court has graded the                            severity of violation as maximum.                                 c   i   A separate procedure for assessing points for speeding offenses shall be                            established by the division based upon the severity of the offense.                                 ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as                                  A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to ten miles per hour                                  B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from    to    miles per                            hour  and                                 C    maximum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by    or more miles per hour.                                 iii   Consideration shall be made for assessment of no points on minimum speeding                            violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.                                 d   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations                            occurring before a time limit set by the division.                                 ii   The time limit may not exceed three years.                                 iii   The division may also delete points to reward violation free driving for periods of                            time set by the division.                                 e   i   By publication in two newspapers having general circulation throughout the                            state, the division shall give notice of the number of points it has assigned to each type of                            traffic violation, the time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level                            at which the division will generally take action to deny or suspend under this section.                                 ii   The division may not change any of the information provided above regarding                               points without first giving new notice in the same manner.                                     a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the                            division shall immediately notify the licensee in a manner specified by the division and afford                            him an opportunity for a hearing in the county where the licensee resides.                                 ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may                            administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of                            relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.                                 iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision                            made after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made                            after a hearing before the full membership of the division.                                 iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,                            extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.                                 b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications                            determined by the division regarding a person                                  i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination                                  ii   who is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle                                  iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities that might make him dangerous                            on the highways  or                                 iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to drive a motor vehicle safely.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state                            upon receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed                            there that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a                            license.                                 b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                            nonresident driver of a motor vehicle or motorboat of any offense under the motor vehicle laws                            of this state, forward a certified copy of the record to the motor vehicle administrator in the                            state where the person convicted is a resident.                                     a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a                               motor vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be                            suspended or revoked.                                 b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when his license has                            been suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                                     a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of                            more than one year except                                  i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                                      ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges                            under Section                                                   iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports                            under Subsection                      and                                 iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section                                  a        .                                 b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until he                            shows satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                                     a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b,                            Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any                            person without hearing and without receiving a record of his conviction for a crime when the                            division has reason to believe that the person s license was granted by the division through                            error or fraud or that the necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is terminated.                                 b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that                            after the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                      a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is                            incompetent or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified                            by the  division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                 b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                            person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction                            imposed in accordance with Section                 .                                    c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                            suspension or revocation of his license.
