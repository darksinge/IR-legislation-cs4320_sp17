If construction of a new building or facility  will be paid for by nonstate funds, but         will require an immediate or future increase in state funding for operations and maintenance or        for capital improvements, the Legislature may not authorize the new building or facility until        the Legislature appropriates funds for               a   the portion of operations and maintenance, if any, that will require an immediate or        future increase in state funding  and              b   the portion of capital improvements, if any, that will require an immediate or future        increase in state funding.                  a   Except as provided in Subsection     b   or  c  , the Legislature may not fund        the design or construction of any new capital development projects, except to complete the        funding of projects for which partial funding has been previously provided, until the        Legislature has appropriated  .   of the replacement cost of existing state facilities and        infrastructure to capital improvements.              b   i   As used in this Subsection     b                A    Education Fund budget deficit  is as defined in Section   J        and              B    General Fund budget deficit  is as defined in Section   J      .              ii   If the Legislature determines that an Education Fund budget deficit or a General        Fund budget deficit exists, the Legislature may, in eliminating the deficit, reduce the amount        appropriated to capital improvements to  .   of the replacement cost of state buildings and        infrastructure.               c   i   The requirements under Subsections     a  and  b  do not apply to the        ,               ,        ,        , and         fiscal years.                ii   For the         fiscal year, the amount appropriated to capital improvements shall        be reduced to  .   of the replacement cost of state facilities.                   It is the policy of the Legislature that a new building or facility be approved and        funded for construction in a single budget action, therefore the Legislature may not fund the        programming, design, and construction of a new building or facility in phases over more than        one year unless the Legislature has approved each phase of the funding for the construction of        the new building or facility by the affirmative vote of two thirds of all the members elected to        each house.                  a   If, after approval of capital development and capital improvement priorities by        the Legislature under this section, emergencies arise that create unforeseen critical capital        improvement projects, the State Building Board may, notwithstanding the requirements of Title          J, Chapter  , Budgetary Procedures Act, reallocate capital improvement funds to address        those projects.              b   The State Building Board shall report any changes it makes in capital improvement        allocations approved by the Legislature to               i   the Office of Legislative Fiscal Analyst within    days of the reallocation  and              ii   the Legislature at its next annual general session.                   a   The State Building Board may adopt a rule allocating to institutions and        agencies their proportionate share of capital improvement funding.              b   The State Building Board shall ensure that the rule               i   reserves funds for the Division of Facilities Construction and Management for        emergency projects  and              ii   allows the delegation of projects to some institutions and agencies with the        requirement that a report of expenditures will be filed annually with the Division of Facilities        Construction and Management and appropriate governing bodies.                   It is the intent of the Legislature that in funding capital improvement requirements        under this section the General Fund be considered as a funding source for at least half of those        costs.                   a   Subject to Subsection      b , at least     of the state funds appropriated for        capital improvements shall be used for maintenance or repair of the existing building or        facility.              b   The State Building Board may modify the requirement described in Subsection             a  if the State Building Board determines that a different allocation of capital        improvements funds is in the best interest of the state.
