This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                       , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Board of Pardons and Parole    Creation    Compensation    Functions.                   There is created the Board of Pardons and Parole.  The board shall consist of five          full time members and five pro tempore members to be appointed by the governor with the advice          and consent of the Senate as provided in this section.  The members of the board shall be resident          citizens of the state.  The governor shall establish salaries for the members of the board within the          salary range fixed by the Legislature in Title   , Chapter   , State Officer Compensation.                   a   i   The full time board members shall serve terms of five years.  The terms of the          full time members shall be staggered so one board member is appointed for a term of five years          on March   of each year.               ii   The pro tempore members shall serve terms of five years.  The two pro tempore          members added by Subsection     shall be appointed to terms that both commence on May  ,              , and respectively end on February   ,     , and February   ,     .  These terms are reduced          by two and one years respectively so that the appointment of one pro tempore member expires          every year beginning in     .  Terms previously set to expire will now expire the last day of           February of their respective years.              b   All vacancies occurring on the board for any cause shall be filled by the governor with         the advice and consent of the Senate pursuant to this section for the unexpired term of the vacating         member.              c   The governor may at any time remove any member of the board for inefficiency,         neglect of duty, malfeasance or malfeasance in office, or for cause upon a hearing.              d   A member of the board may not hold any other office in the government of the United         States, this state or any other state, or of any county government or municipal corporation within         a state.  A member may not engage in any occupation or business inconsistent with his duties.               e   A majority of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, including          the holding of hearings at any time or any place within or without the state, or for the purpose of          exercising any duty or authority of the board.  Action taken by a majority of the board regarding          whether parole, pardon, commutation, termination of sentence, or remission of fines or forfeitures          may be granted or restitution ordered in individual cases is deemed the action of the board.  A          majority vote of the five full time members of the board is required for adoption of rules or          policies of general applicability as provided by statute.  However, a vacancy on the board does not          impair the right of the remaining board members to exercise any duty or authority of the board as          long as a majority of the board remains.               f   Any investigation, inquiry, or hearing that the board has authority to undertake or hold          may be conducted by any board member or an examiner appointed by the board.  When any of          these actions are approved and confirmed by the board and filed in its office, they are considered          to be the action of the board and have the same effect as if originally made by the board.               g   When a full time board member is absent or in other extraordinary circumstances the          chair may, as dictated by public interest and efficient administration of the board, assign a pro          tempore member to act in the place of a full time member.  Pro tempore members shall receive a          per diem rate of compensation as established by the Division of Finance and all actual and          necessary expenses incurred in attending to official business.               h   The chair may request staff and administrative support as necessary from the          Department of Corrections.                   a   Except as provided in Subsection     c , the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile          Justice shall                       i   recommend five applicants to the governor for appointment to the Board of Pardons         and Parole  and              ii   consider applicants  knowledge of the criminal justice system, state and federal         criminal law, judicial procedure, corrections policies and procedures, and behavioral sciences.              b   The procedures and requirements of Subsection     a  do not apply if the governor         appoints a sitting board member to a new term of office.                  a   The board shall appoint an individual to serve as its mental health adviser and may         appoint other staff necessary to aid it in fulfilling its responsibilities under Title   , Chapter   a,         Commitment and Treatment of Mentally Ill Persons.  The adviser shall prepare reports and          recommendations to the board on all persons adjudicated as guilty and mentally ill, in accordance          with Title   , Chapter   a.               b   The mental health adviser shall possess the qualifications necessary to carry out the          duties imposed by the board and may not be employed by the Department of Corrections , the          Department of Human Services, or a local mental health authority  or the Utah State Hospital.               i   The Board of Pardons and Parole may review outside employment by the mental health          advisor.               ii   The Board of Pardons and Parole shall develop rules governing employment with          entities other than the board by the mental health advisor for the purpose of prohibiting a conflict          of interest.               c   The mental health adviser shall                i   act as liaison for the board with the Department of Human Services and local mental          health authorities                ii   educate the members of the board regarding the needs and special circumstances of          mentally ill persons in the criminal justice system                iii   in cooperation with the Department of Corrections, monitor the status of persons in          the prison who have been found guilty and mentally ill                iv   monitor the progress of other persons under the board s jurisdiction who are mentally          ill                v   conduct hearings as necessary in the preparation of reports and recommendations  and               vi   perform other duties as assigned by the board.
