To the extent constitutionally permissible, cities, towns, or counties may issue bonds          payable solely from a special fund into which are to be deposited excise taxes levied and collected          by the city, town, or county, or excise taxes levied by the state and rebated pursuant to law to the          city, town, or county, or any combination of those excise taxes, or may pledge all or any part          thereof as an additional source of payment for their general obligation bonds.  For purposes of this          section, excise tax revenues include class B and class C road funds apportioned to counties, cities,          and towns under Section                     .                   Any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds payable in whole or in part from the          proceeds of excise tax revenues may contain covenants with the holder or holders of the bonds as          to the excise tax revenues, the disposition of the excise tax revenues, the issuance of future bonds,          and other pertinent matters as may be deemed necessary by the governing body to assure the          marketability of those bonds, provided the covenants are not inconsistent with the provisions of          this chapter.  Such resolution may also include provisions to insure the enforcement, collection,          and proper application of excise tax revenues as the governing body may think proper.

The state pledges to and agrees with the holders of any bonds issued by a city, town,          or county to which the proceeds of excise taxes collected by the state and rebated to the city, town,          or county are devoted or pledged as authorized in this section, that the state will not alter, impair,          or limit the excise taxes in a manner that reduces the amounts to be rebated to the city, town, or          county which are devoted or pledged as authorized in this section until the bonds or other          securities, together with applicable interest, are fully met and discharged.  Nothing in this section          may preclude such alteration, impairment, or limitation if adequate provision is made by law for          the protection of the holders of the bonds.  Each city, town, or county may include this pledge and          undertaking for the state in those bonds.

Bonds issued solely from a special fund into which are to be deposited excise tax          revenues constitutes a borrowing solely upon the credit of the excise tax revenues received or to          be received by the city, town, or county and does not constitute an indebtedness or pledge of the          general credit of the city, town, or county.  To the extent constitutionally permissible, such bonds          are not subject to the limitations of Article XIV, Utah Constitution nor to any statutory provisions          implementing that article.

The Legislature intends to establish a means for ensuring continued access to the          private and public lands of the state for the good of the people, while fulfilling its fiduciary          responsibilities toward the schoolchildren by protecting their trust holdings against loss.

The grant of the temporary public easement or right of entry under Subsection     is          consistent with the trust responsibilities of the state and in the best interest of the state.                   A responsible authority that has been granted a permanent easement or right of entry          over state lands may maintain the permanent easement or right of entry for the uses to which the          permanent easement or right of entry was put prior to and including January  ,     , subject to          the right of the managing unit of state government or private party to relocate the permanent          easement or right of entry.

The safety standards established by the Department of Transportation in accordance          with Section                      apply to all determinations of safety on R.S.                rights of way used for vehicular travel.

The holder of an R.S.       right of way and the owner of the servient estate shall         exercise their rights without unreasonably interfering with one another.                  The holder of the R.S.       right of way shall design and conduct construction and         maintenance activities so as to minimize impacts on adjacent federal public lands, consistent with         applicable safety standards.

In accordance with the terms of the R.S.       right of way grant, once accepted, an          R.S.       right of way is established for a perpetual term.                   a   Abandonment of any R.S.       right of way shall only take place in accordance          with the procedures in  Title   , Chapter   , Article  , Acquisition of Property for Highway          Purposes  Part  , Public Highways, of this chapter.               b   If any R.S.       right of way is abandoned by a political subdivision of the state, the          right of way shall revert to the state.                            The passage of time or the frequency of use of an R.S.       right of way is not         evidence of waiver or abandonment of the R.S.       right of way.                  An R.S.       right of way continues even if the servient estate is transferred out of         the public domain.             Section    .

The state and its political subdivisions do not waive immunity under Title   , Chapter            , Utah Governmental Immunity Act, for injuries or damages occurring in or associated with any          R.S.       right of way.                   The state and its political subdivisions assume no liability for injury or damage          resulting from a failure to maintain any                a   R.S.       right of way for vehicular travel  or               b   highway sign on an R.S.       right of way.                   If the state or any political subdivision of the state chooses to maintain an R.S.                right of way, the basic governmental objective involved in providing the improvements is the          consistent promotion of public safety.                   a   The state recognizes that there are limited funds available to upgrade all R.S.                rights of way to applicable safety standards.               b   A decision by the state or a political subdivision of the state to allocate funds for          maintaining an R.S.       right of way is the result of evaluation and assigning of priorities for          the promotion of public safety.               c   The state or a political subdivision of the state must use its judgment and expertise to          evaluate which safety feature improvements should be made first.  In making this policy          determination the state or a political subdivision of the state may                i   perform on site inspections and weigh all factors relating to safety, including the          physical characteristics and configuration of the R.S.       right of way and the volume and type          of traffic on the R.S.      right of way  and                        ii   consult with transportation experts who have expertise to make an evaluation of the         relative dangerousness of R.S.       rights of way within their jurisdiction.

Alcohol concentration in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per              milliliters of blood, and alcohol concentration in the breath shall be based upon grams of alcohol          per     liters of breath.                   a   A person convicted of a violation of Subsection     is guilty of a                i   class B misdemeanor  or               ii   class A misdemeanor if the person has also inflicted bodily injury upon another as a          proximate result of having operated the aircraft in a negligent manner.               b   In this section, the standard of negligence is that of simple negligence, the failure to          exercise that degree of care that an ordinarily reasonable and prudent person exercises under like          or similar circumstances.                   A peace officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person for a violation of this section          when the officer has probable cause to believe                a   the violation has occurred, although not in  his  the officer s presence  and               b   the violation was committed by that person.

Implied consent to chemical tests for alcohol or drugs             Number of tests    Refusal    Person incapable of refusal    Results of test available    Who          may give test    Evidence.                  a   A person operating an aircraft in this state consents to a chemical test or tests of his         breath, blood, or urine               i   for the purpose of determining whether  he  the person was operating or in actual         physical control of an aircraft while having a blood or breath alcohol content statutorily prohibited         under Section                    , or while under the influence of alcohol, any drug, or          combination of alcohol and any drug under Section                    , if the test is or tests are          administered at the direction of a peace officer having grounds to believe that person to have been          operating or in actual physical control of an aircraft in violation of Section                               or               ii   if the person operating the aircraft is involved in an accident that results in death,          serious injury, or substantial aircraft damage.               b   i   The peace officer determines which of the tests are administered and how many of          them are administered.               ii   The peace officer may order any or all tests of the person s breath, blood, or urine.               iii   If an officer requests more than one test, refusal by a person to take one or more          requested tests, even though  he  the person does submit to any other requested test or tests, is a          refusal under this section.               c   i   A person who has been requested under this section to submit to a chemical test or          tests of  his  the person s breath, blood, or urine may not select the test or tests to be administered.               ii   The failure or inability of a peace officer to arrange for any specific chemical test is          not a defense to taking a test requested by a peace officer, and it is not a defense in any criminal,          civil, or administrative proceeding resulting from a person s refusal to submit to the requested test          or tests.                   a   If the person has been placed under arrest and has then been requested by a peace          officer to submit to any one or more of the chemical tests provided in Subsection     and refuses          to submit to any chemical test, the person shall be warned by the peace officer requesting the test          that a refusal to submit to the test is admissible in civil or criminal proceedings as provided under                   Subsection    .              b   Following this warning, unless the person immediately requests that the chemical test         offered by a peace officer be administered, a test may not be given.                  Any person who is dead, unconscious, or in any other condition rendering  him  the         person incapable of refusal to submit to any chemical test or tests is considered to not have         withdrawn the consent provided for in Subsection    , and the test or tests may be administered         whether the person has been arrested or not.                  Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the test or tests shall be         made available to him.                   a   Only a physician, registered nurse, practical nurse, or person authorized under           Section         to draw blood under Section        .  , acting at the request of a peace officer,          may withdraw blood to determine the alcohol or drug content. This limitation does not apply to          the taking of a urine or breath specimen.               b   Any physician, registered nurse, practical nurse, or person authorized under Section                  to draw blood under Section        .   who, at the direction of a peace officer, draws a          sample of blood from any person whom a peace officer has reason to believe is flying in violation          of this chapter, or hospital or medical facility at which the sample is drawn, is immune from any          civil or criminal liability arising from drawing the sample, if the test is administered according to          standard medical practice.                   a   The person to be tested may, at  his  the person s own expense, have a physician          of  his  the person s own choice administer a chemical test in addition to the test or tests          administered at the direction of a peace officer.               b   The failure or inability to obtain the additional test does not affect admissibility of the          results of the test or tests taken at the direction of a peace officer, or preclude or delay the test or          tests to be taken at the direction of a peace officer.               c   The additional test shall be subsequent to the test or tests administered at the direction          of a peace officer.                   For the purpose of determining whether to submit to a chemical test or tests, the person          to be tested does not have the right to consult an attorney or have an attorney, physician, or other          person present as a condition for the taking of any test.                   If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test or tests or any additional                   test under this section, evidence of any refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or         proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was operating or         in actual physical control of an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol, any drug, or         combination of alcohol and any drug.                  The results of any test taken under this section or the refusal to be tested shall be         reported to the Federal Aviation Administration by the peace officer requesting the test.

Standards for chemical breath analysis    Evidence.                   The commissioner of the Department of Public Safety shall establish standards for the          administration and interpretation of chemical analysis of a person s breath, including standards of          training.                   In any action or proceeding in which it is material to prove that a person was operating          or in actual physical control of an aircraft while under the influence of alcohol or any drug or          operating with a blood or breath alcohol content statutorily prohibited, documents offered as          memoranda or records of acts, conditions, or events to prove that the analysis was made and the          instrument used was accurate, according to standards established in Subsection    , are admissible          if                a   the judge finds that they were made in the regular course of the investigation at or          about the time of the act, condition, or event  and               b   the source of information from which made and the method and circumstances of their          preparation indicate their trustworthiness.                   If the judge finds that the standards established under Subsection     and the conditions          of Subsection     have been met, there is a presumption that the test results are valid and further          foundation for introduction of the evidence is unnecessary.              Section    .  Section           , which is renumbered from Section         is renumbered          and amended to read                         .               .  Admissibility of chemical test results in actions for flying           under the influence    Weight of evidence.                   a   In any civil or criminal action or proceeding in which it is material to prove that a          person was operating or in actual physical control of an aircraft while under the influence of                   alcohol, drugs, or with a blood or breath alcohol content statutorily prohibited, the results of a         chemical test or tests as authorized in Section                     are admissible as evidence.              b   i   In a criminal proceeding, noncompliance with Section                     does         not render the results of the chemical test inadmissible.              ii   Evidence of a defendant s blood or breath alcohol content or drug content is admissible         except when prohibited by Rules of Evidence or the constitution.                  If the chemical test was taken more than two hours after the alleged flying or actual         physical control, the test result is admissible as evidence of the person s blood or breath alcohol         level at the time of the alleged operating or actual physical control, but the trier of fact shall          determine what weight is given to the result of the test.                   This section does not prevent a court from receiving otherwise admissible evidence as          to a defendant s blood or breath alcohol level or drug level at the time of the alleged operating or          actual physical control.
