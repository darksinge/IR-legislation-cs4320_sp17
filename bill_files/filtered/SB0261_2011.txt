Trustee                                  b   If the stated purpose of the obligation for which the trust deed was given as security                            is to finance residential rental property, the notice required under Subsection     c  shall                            include a statement, in at least    point font, substantially as follows                                  Notice to Tenant                                As stated in the accompanying Notice of Trustee s Sale, this property is scheduled to be                            sold at public auction to the highest bidder unless the default in the obligation secured by this                               property is cured.  If the property is sold, you may be allowed under federal law to continue to                            occupy your rental unit until your rental agreement expires, or until    days after the date you                            are served with a notice to vacate, whichever is later.  If your rental or lease agreement expires                            after the    day period, you may need to provide a copy of your rental or lease agreement to the                            new owner to prove your right to remain on the property longer than    days after the sale of                            the property.                                You must continue to pay your rent and comply with other requirements of your rental                            or lease agreement or you will be subject to eviction for violating your rental or lease                            agreement.                                The new owner or the new owner s representative will probably contact you after the                            property is sold with directions about where to pay rent.                                The new owner of the property may or may not want to offer to enter into a new rental                            or lease agreement with you at the expiration of the period described above.                                      The failure to provide notice as required under Subsections     c  and     b  or a                            defect in that notice may not be the basis for challenging or invaliding a trustee s sale.                                     A trustee qualified under Subsection                    a  i  or  iv  who exercises a power                           of sale has a duty to the trustor not to defraud, or conspire or scheme to defraud, the trustor.
