Section         is amended to read                    . Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody       consideration.                 If a  husband and wife  married couple having one or more minor children are       separated, or their marriage is declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the       future care and custody of the minor children as it considers appropriate.             a   In determining any form of custody, including a change in custody, the court shall       consider the best interests of the child without preference for either  the mother or father        parent solely because of the biological sex of the parent and, among other factors the court       finds relevant, the following              i   the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties              ii   which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including       allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent              iii   the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth, quality,       and nature of the relationship between a parent and child              iv   whether the parent has intentionally exposed the child to pornography or material       harmful to a minor, as defined in Section             and             v   those factors outlined in Section        . .             b   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that joint legal custody, as defined in       Section        . , is in the best interest of the child, except in cases where there is              i   domestic violence in the home or in the presence of the child              ii   special physical or mental needs of a parent or child, making joint legal custody       unreasonable              iii   physical distance between the residences of the parents, making joint decision       making impractical in certain circumstances  or             iv   any other factor the court considers relevant including those listed in this section       and Section        . .             c   The person who desires joint legal custody shall file a proposed parenting plan in       accordance with Sections        .  and        . .  A presumption for joint legal custody may       be rebutted by a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it is not in the best interest of       the child.             d   The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact       determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the       children be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.             e   The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s       desires regarding future custody or parent time schedules, but the expressed desires are not       controlling and the court may determine the children s custody or parent time otherwise.  The       desires of a child    years of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single       controlling factor.             f   If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection           e , they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be       obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only       method to ascertain the child s desires regarding custody.                 In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds       relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing       the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds       appropriate.                 If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court shall       take that evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other       parent.                 a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , a court may not discriminate against a       parent due to a disability, as defined in Section        , in awarding custody or determining       whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.             b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining       whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody,       the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising from the        disability by showing that               i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to        provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or              ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources        available to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of        the child at issue.              c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under        Title   B, Chapter  , Part  , Utah Adoption Act.                  This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint        physical custody or sole physical custody, but allows the court and the family the widest        discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.                  When an issue before the court involves custodial responsibility in the event of a        deployment of one or both parents who are servicemembers, and the servicemember has not yet        been notified of deployment, the court shall resolve the issue based on the standards in Sections          B        through   B       .

Joint physical custody                a   means the child stays with each parent overnight for more than     of the year, and        both parents contribute to the expenses of the child in addition to paying child support               b   can mean equal or nearly equal periods of physical custody of and access to the        child by each of the parents, as required to meet the best interest of the child               c   may require that a primary physical residence for the child be designated  and              d   does not prohibit the court from specifying one parent as the primary caretaker and        one home as the primary residence of the child.

The parenting plan shall contain provisions for resolution of future disputes        between the parents, allocation of decision making authority, and residential provisions for the        child, and provisions addressing notice and parent time responsibilities in the event of the        relocation of either party.

Regardless of the allocation of decision making in the parenting plan,        either parent may make emergency decisions affecting the health or safety of the child.                  Each parent may make decisions regarding the day to day care and control of the        child while the child is residing with that parent.                  When mutual decision making is designated but cannot be achieved, the parties        shall make a good faith effort to resolve the issue through the dispute resolution process.                  The plan shall include a residential schedule which designates in which parent s        home each minor child shall reside on given days of the year, including provisions for holidays,        birthdays of family members, vacations, and other special occasions.                  If a parent fails to comply with a provision of the parenting plan or a child support        order, the other parent s obligations under the parenting plan or the child support order are not        affected.  Failure to comply with a provision of the parenting plan or a child support order may        result in a finding of contempt of court.                   a   When one or both parents are servicemembers, the parenting plan shall contain        provisions that address the foreseeable parenting and custodial issues likely to arise in the event        of notification of deployment or other contingency, including long term deployments,        short term deployments, death, incapacity, and noncombatant evacuation operations.              b   The provisions in the parenting plan described in Subsection      a  shall comport        substantially with the requirements of an agreement made pursuant to Section   B       .

The court may make alterations in the parent time schedule to reasonably        accommodate the work schedule of both parents and may increase the parent time allowed to        the noncustodial parent but may not diminish the standardized parent time provided in Sections                and        . .

Each parent shall permit and encourage, during reasonable hours, reasonable and        uncensored communications with the child, in the form of mail privileges and virtual        parent time if the equipment is reasonably available, provided that if the parties cannot agree        on whether the equipment is reasonably available, the court shall decide whether the equipment        for virtual parent time is reasonably available, taking into consideration               a   the best interests of the child               b   each parent s ability to handle any additional expenses for virtual parent time  and              c   any other factors the court considers material.                   Parental care shall be presumed to be better care for the child than surrogate care        and the court shall encourage the parties to cooperate in allowing the noncustodial parent, if        willing and able to transport the children, to provide the child care.  Child care arrangements        existing during the marriage are preferred as are child care arrangements with nominal or no        charge.                   Each parent shall provide all surrogate care providers with the name, current        address, and telephone number of the other parent and shall provide the noncustodial parent        with the name, current address, and telephone number of all surrogate care providers unless the        court for good cause orders otherwise.                   Each parent shall be entitled to an equal division of major religious holidays        celebrated by the parents, and the parent who celebrates a religious holiday that the other parent        does not celebrate shall have the right to be together with the child on the religious holiday.                   If the child is on a different parent time schedule than a sibling, based on Sections                and        . , the parents should consider if an upward deviation for parent time with        all the minor children so that parent time is uniform between school aged and nonschool aged        children, is appropriate.                   When one or both parents are servicemembers or contemplating joining a        uniformed service, the parents should resolve issues of custodial responsibility in the event of        deployment as soon as practicable through reaching a voluntary agreement pursuant to Section          B        or through court order obtained pursuant to Section        .
