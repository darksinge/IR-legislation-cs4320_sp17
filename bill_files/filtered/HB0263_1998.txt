REMOVAL OF DIRECTORY SUBSIDY           AMENDMENTS                  GENERAL SESSION          STATE OF UTAH           Sponsor  J. Brent Haymond          AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC UTILITIES  MODIFYING PROVISIONS RELATED TO         PRICE REGULATION  PROVIDING FOR THE REMOVAL OF SUBSIDIES RELATED TO         PRINTED DIRECTORIES FROM THE RATE STRUCTURE OF THE INCUMBENT         TELEPHONE CORPORATION  DIRECTING THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION TO          MAKE THE RATE ADJUSTMENT THROUGH A RATE HEARING  ESTABLISHING AN          EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THE RATE ADJUSTMENT  AND MAKING TECHNICAL          CORRECTIONS.          This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                    b  . , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section      b  .  is amended to read                    b  . .  Price regulation    Maximum prices.                   The Legislature finds that                a   traditional rate of return regulation cannot guarantee that customers who do not have          the choice of alternative providers will be protected from the economic responsibility for making          up for an incumbent telephone corporation s competitive losses or from providing for the recovery          of past, regulated investments                b   the method of regulation set forth in this section will provide better protection to          customers who lack competitive choices than does traditional rate of return regulation  and               c   before moving from traditional rate of return regulation, it is essential the commission          address issues relating to the movement of prices towards cost and removing subsidies in the           existing price structure of incumbent telephone corporations to encourage competition for all         telecommunications services.                  a   Effective May  ,     , any incumbent telephone corporation with more than   ,            access lines in the state shall be regulated pursuant to this section and may not be regulated on the         basis of rate of return or any similar method of regulation that is based on the earnings of the         incumbent telephone corporation, except as provided in this section.              b   Any incumbent telephone corporation serving fewer than   ,    access lines in the         state may petition the commission to be regulated under price regulation rather than traditional rate         of return regulation.  In adopting price regulation for incumbent telephone corporations with fewer          than   ,    access lines, the commission may modify the provisions of this section taking into          consideration the individual circumstances of the incumbent telephone corporation seeking price          regulation.                   a   Any general rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than            ,    access lines in the state initiated before May  ,     , shall be based on a      test period          and shall be conducted under the principles of traditional rate of return regulation, even though the          final order in the case is not issued until May  ,     , or thereafter.               b   A rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than   ,             access lines in the state may be initiated after April   ,     , and before March  ,     .               i   The rate proceeding shall be revenue neutral relative to the last proceeding filed          pursuant to Subsection     a , except that the commission may increase or decrease the revenue          anticipated from all rates to account for changes in the following factors which are known and          measurable at the time of hearings in the case                A   any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone          corporation required by federal or state law or  approval  approved by the commission                B   changes in rules of the Federal Communications Commission, including rules with          regard to the separation of interstate and intrastate revenues, expenses, or investments                C   changes in tax rates applied to the incumbent telephone corporation                D   any other change external to the business operations of the incumbent telephone          corporation resulting from                I   accounting rules adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and approved          by the commission  or                      II   laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction  or              E   any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April   ,     .              ii   In the rate proceeding, the commission may also rebalance rates of particular services         to move rates of those services toward cost.                  a   The prices of tariffed telecommunications services offered by an incumbent         telephone corporation with more than   ,    access lines in the state may not increase during the         three year period commencing with the date of the final order in the last rate case initiated before         May  ,     .  The prices of services offered pursuant to a price list or competitive contract shall         be governed by Section     b  . .               b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , prices may increase pursuant to any prices          established in a final order of the commission for a rate proceeding initiated before March  ,     ,          or the adjustment of those prices as a result of an appeal or remand of the final order, or as a result          of the adjustment provided in Subsection    .                   a   Effective at the end of the three year period specified in Subsection    , the          commission shall regulate the maximum prices for the tariffed public telecommunications services          of the incumbent telephone corporation according to an aggregate price index or price indices          associated with groups of services.  The aggregate price index or price indices shall be adjusted          annually to reflect the effects of inflation, productivity, and exogenous factors and to maintain an          appropriate level of service quality.  The precise manner of annual adjustment shall be developed          by the commission after notice and a hearing and before the end of the three year period.               b   Factors in the price index or price indices may also include the following                i   any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone          corporation required by federal or state law or approved by the commission                ii   the impact of alteration in asset lives to better reflect changes in the economic lives of          plant and equipment approved by the commission consistent with Section        .                 iii   changes in rules of the Federal Communications Commission, including rules with          regard to the separation of interstate and intrastate revenues, expenses, or investments adopted by          the commission                iv   changes in tax rates applied to the incumbent telephone corporation                v   any other change external to the business operations of the incumbent telephone          corporation resulting from                       A   accounting rules adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and approved         by the commission  or              B   laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction  or              vi   any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April   ,     .                  a   The incumbent telephone corporation may decrease the price of a tariffed         telecommunications service subject to the limitation in Section     b  . .              b   Any decrease in price shall be made by filing a tariff with the commission.  The         decrease shall become effective    days after filing.                  a   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section or of Section       ,       ,                ,        , or        , as part of the removal of subsidies from the rate structure of the          incumbent telephone corporation to encourage competition for all telecommunications services,          the commission shall adjust rates to reflect the removal of all amounts currently embedded in the          rates of the incumbent telephone corporation related to the publication of printed directories by an          affiliate corporation.               b   The commission shall accomplish the rate adjustment in Subsection     a  by initiating          a proceeding to adjust rates of services to which directory revenues are allocated based upon the          allocation of directory revenue to those services in the embedded cost of service study of the          Division of Public Utilities used by the commission in its decision in the last rate case of the          incumbent telephone corporation initiated before May  ,     .               c   The rate adjustment in Subsection     a  shall be effective not later than January  ,              .
