Medical or psychiatric conditions which existed prior to enrollment may not be a                              basis for disability benefits until the eligible employee has had one year of continuous                           enrollment in the Public Employees Long Term Disability Program.                                     If there is a valid benefit protection contract, service credit shall accrue during the                           period of total disability, unless the disabled eligible employee is exempted from a system, or is                           otherwise ineligible for service credit.                                     Regardless of any medical evidence provided by the employee to support the                          application for disability, an employee is not eligible for long term disability benefits during                          any period in which the employee                                 a   makes a claim that the employee is able to work  or                                b   has a pending action in a court or before any state or local administrative body in                          which the employee has made a claim that the employee is able to work.
