When a decree of divorce is rendered, the court may include in it equitable orders                           relating to the children, property, debts or obligations, and parties.  The court shall include the                           following in every decree of divorce                                 a   an order assigning responsibility for the payment of reasonable and necessary                           medical and dental expenses of the dependent children                                 b   if coverage is or becomes available at a reasonable cost, an order requiring the                           purchase and maintenance of appropriate health, hospital, and dental care insurance for the                           dependent children                                 c   pursuant to Section           .                                      i   an order specifying which party is responsible for the payment of joint debts,                           obligations, or liabilities of the parties contracted or incurred during marriage                                 ii   an order requiring the parties to notify respective creditors or obligees, regarding                           the court s division of debts, obligations, or liabilities and regarding the parties  separate,                           current addresses  and                                iii   provisions for the enforcement of these orders   and                                 d   provisions for income withholding in accordance with Title   A, Chapter   ,                           Recovery Services .   and                                e   provisions to include fees pursuant to Section       A       .      as part of the support                          order when one or both parties are receiving child support services as defined in Subsection                               A              .                                    The court may include, in an order determining child support, an order assigning                           financial responsibility for all or a portion of child care expenses incurred on behalf of the                           dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.  If the                           court determines that the circumstances are appropriate and that the dependent children would                              be adequately cared for, it may include an order allowing the noncustodial parent to provide                           child care for the dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the                           custodial parent.                                    The court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for                           the custody of the children and their support, maintenance, health, and dental care, and for                           distribution of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary.                                    Child support, custody, visitation, and other matters related to children born to the                           mother and father after entry of the decree of divorce may be added to the decree by                           modification.                                    a   In determining parent time rights of parents and visitation rights of grandparents                           and other members of the immediate family, the court shall consider the best interest of the                           child.                                b   Upon a specific finding by the court of the need for peace officer enforcement, the                           court may include in an order establishing a parent time or visitation schedule a provision,                           among other things, authorizing any peace officer to enforce a court ordered parent time or                           visitation schedule entered under this chapter.                                    If a petition for modification of child custody or parent time provisions of a court                           order is made and denied, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the reasonable attorneys                            fees expended by the prevailing party in that action, if the court determines that the petition                           was without merit and not asserted or defended against in good faith.                                    If a petition alleges noncompliance with a parent time order by a parent, or a                           visitation order by a grandparent or other member of the immediate family where a visitation or                           parent time right has been previously granted by the court, the court may award to the                           prevailing party costs, including actual attorney fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing                           party because of the other party s failure to provide or exercise court ordered visitation or                           parent time.                                    a   The court shall consider at least the following factors in determining alimony                                 i   the financial condition and needs of the recipient spouse                                 ii   the recipient s earning capacity or ability to produce income                                 iii   the ability of the payor spouse to provide support                                 iv   the length of the marriage                                    v   whether the recipient spouse has custody of minor children requiring support                                 vi   whether the recipient spouse worked in a business owned or operated by the payor                           spouse  and                                vii   whether the recipient spouse directly contributed to any increase in the payor                           spouse s skill by paying for education received by the payor spouse or allowing the payor                           spouse to attend school during the marriage.                                b   The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining alimony.                                c   As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at the                           time of separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection     a .  However, the                           court shall consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion, base                            alimony on the standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short                            duration, when no children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may                            consider the standard of living that existed at the time of the marriage.                                 d   The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the parties                             respective standards of living.                                 e   When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major change in                            the income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change shall be                            considered in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony.  If one                            spouse s earning capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses during                            the marriage, the court may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital property                            and awarding alimony.                                 f   In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no                            children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring                            each party to the condition which existed at the time of the marriage.                                 g   i   The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new                            orders regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not                            foreseeable at the time of the divorce.                                 ii   The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address                            needs of the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court                            finds extenuating circumstances that justify that action.                                 iii   In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not                               be considered, except as provided in this Subsection    .                                 A   The court may consider the subsequent spouse s financial ability to share living                            expenses.                                 B   The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that                            the payor s improper conduct justifies that consideration.                                 h   Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years that the                            marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony, the court finds extenuating                            circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.                                     Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court                            that a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage or                            death of that former spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void ab                            initio, payment of alimony shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the                            action of annulment and his rights are determined.                                      Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates                            upon establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with                            another person.
