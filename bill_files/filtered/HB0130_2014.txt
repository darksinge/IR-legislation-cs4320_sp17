  which the person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be                            decreased by     if on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded                            the severity of violation as minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court                            has graded the severity of violation

severity of the offense.                                 ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as                                  A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to    miles per hour                                  B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from    to    miles per                            hour  and

may conduct the hearing, and any decision                            made after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made                            after a hearing before the full membership of the division.                                 iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,

    Services has ordered the suspension of the person s license.                                 b   A suspension under Subsection     a  shall remain in effect until the division                            receives notice from the Office of Recovery Services that the Office of Recovery Services has                            rescinded the order of suspension.                                 c   After an order of suspension is rescinded under Subsection     b , a report                            authorized by Section                  may not contain any evidence of the suspension.

Subsection    , and ending on the day that the temporary limited                            driver license expires, the suspension described in this Subsection     only applies if the person                            who is suspended operates a motor vehicle for a purpose other than employment, education, or                            child visitation.                                 B   Upon expiration of a temporary limited driver license described in this Subsection                                d                                   I   a suspension described in Subsection     a

person in another state of an offense committed                            there that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a                            license.                                 b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                            nonresident driver of a motor vehicle or

motor vehicle upon a highway when the person s                            license has been suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                                     a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of                            more than one year except                                  i   for failure to comply with

        v   when the division suspends the license under Subsection      or                                 vi   when the division denies the license under Subsection     .                                 b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until the                            person shows satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                            Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any                            person without hearing and without receiving a record of the person s conviction for a crime                            when the division has reason to believe that the person s license was granted by the division                            through error or fraud or that the necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is                            terminated.                                 b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that                            after the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                      a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is                            incompetent or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified                            by the  division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                 b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                            person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction                            imposed in accordance with Section                 .                                 c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                            suspension or revocation of the licensee s license.                                      a   Except as provided in Subsection      b , a report authorized by Section                                          may not contain any evidence of a conviction for speeding on an interstate system in                            this state if the conviction was for a speed of    miles per hour or less, above the posted speed                            limit and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in a manner specified by the division                            by the individual whose report is being requested.                                    b   The provisions of Subsection      a  do not apply for                                  i   a CDL license holder  or                                 ii   a violation that occurred in a commercial motor vehicle.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   G, Chapter  ,                            Administrative Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person                            if it has reason to believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is                            required under Title   , Chapter   a, Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Owners and                            Operators Act, and has driven the motor vehicle or permitted it to be driven within this state                            without the security being in effect.                                 b   The division may immediately suspend a driving privilege card holder s driving                            privilege card if the division receives notification from the Motor Vehicle Division that                                  i   the driving privilege card holder is the registered owner of a vehicle  and                                 ii   the driving privilege card holder s vehicle registration has been revoked under                            Subsection        a             a  ii  A .                                 c   Section         a          regarding the requirement of proof of owner s or operator s                            security applies to persons whose driving privileges are suspended under this Subsection     .                                 d   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this                            Subsection     , the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.                                 e   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been                            revoked by the division under this Subsection      may file a request for agency action                            requesting a hearing.                                      The division may deny an individual s license if the person fails to comply with                            the requirement to downgrade the person s CDL to a class D license under Section            .      .                                      The division may deny a person s class A, B, C, or D license if the person fails to                            comply with the requirement to have a K restriction removed from the person s license.                                      Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also                            disqualifies any license issued to that person under Part  , Uniform Commercial Driver License                            Act.                                Section  .    Section                 is amended to read                                          .

The criterion is whether upon all the                            evidence it is safe to permit the applicant to drive a motor vehicle or mobility vehicle.                                 b   In deciding whether to grant or deny a license or mobility vehicle permit, the                            division may be guided by the opinion of experts in the fields of diagnosing and treating                            mental, physical, or emotional disabilities and may take into consideration any other factors                               that bear on the issue of public safety.
