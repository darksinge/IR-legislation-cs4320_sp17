A hold on an article under Subsection     takes precedence over any request to                            claim or purchase the article subject to the hold.                                     When the purpose for the hold on or seizure of an article is terminated, the law                            enforcement agency requiring the hold or seizure shall within    days after the termination                                  a   notify the pawn or secondhand business in writing that the hold or seizure has been                            terminated                                  b   return the article subject to the seizure to the pawn or secondhand business  or                                 c   if the article is not returned to the pawn or secondhand business, advise the pawn or                            secondhand business either in writing or electronically of the specific alternative disposition of                            the article.                                     If the law enforcement agency does not notify the pawn or secondhand business                            that a hold on an item has expired, the pawn or secondhand business shall send a letter by                            registered or certified mail to the law enforcement agency that ordered the hold and inform the                            agency that the holding period has expired.  The law enforcement agency shall respond within                               days by                                  a   confirming that the holding period has expired and that the pawn or secondhand                            business may manage the item as if acquired in the ordinary course of business  or                                 b   providing written notice to the pawn or secondhand business that a court order has                            continued the period of time for which the item shall be held.

If the law enforcement agency does not respond within    days under Subsection                               , the pawn or secondhand business may manage the item as if acquired in the ordinary                            course of business.
