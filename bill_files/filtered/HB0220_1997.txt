Special orders become effective ten days after notification or mailing         to the last known address of the individuals or concerns affected thereby.                  The commission shall cause to be printed for distribution to the public               a   the text of this chapter               b   the commission s rules               c   the commission s annual reports to the governor  and              d   any other material the commission considers relevant and suitable and shall furnish         them to any person upon application.                  a   The commission shall appoint on a nonpartisan merit basis, fix the compensation,          and prescribe the duties and powers of officers, accountants, attorneys, experts, and other          personnel as necessary in the performance of its duties.

under federal and state law, make         arrangements  that will permit individuals employed under this chapter  to voluntarily elect         coverage under the United States Civil Service Retirement System or a comparable private         retirement plan with respect to past as well as future services of individuals hired under this         chapter prior to October  ,     , and whose service

from the council, such as women, minorities, and individuals          with disabilities.               d    i   Except as required by Subsection     d  ii , as terms of current council members

appointed every two years.               e   When a vacancy occurs in the membership for any reason, the replacement shall be          appointed for the unexpired term.               f   The commission shall terminate the term of any council member who ceases to be          representative as designated by his original appointment.               g   The commission may appoint local

formulating policies and discussing problems related to the administration of this chapter and                 in assuring impartiality and freedom from political influence in the solution of those problems.              i   i   Members shall receive no compensation or benefits for their services, but may         receive per diem and expenses incurred in the performance of the member s official duties at the         rates established by the Division of Finance under Sections   A       and   A      .              ii   Members may decline to receive per diem and expenses for their service.

Except as provided in Subsection     , each new employer shall pay a contribution rate          based on the average benefit cost rate experienced by employers of the major industry as defined          by  department rule to which the new employer belongs, the basic contribution rate to be          determined as follows                a    On  Except as provided in Subsection     b , on or before January   of each year, the          basic contribution rate to be used in computing the employer s overall contribution rate is the          benefit cost rate which is the greater of                i   the amount calculated by dividing the total benefit costs charged back to both active          and inactive employers of the same major industry for the last two fiscal years  shall be divided           by the total taxable wages paid by those employers that were paid during the same time period,          computed to four decimal places, disregarding the remaining fraction, if any .  The benefit cost rate          shall constitute the basic contribution rate of a new employer, but not less than   or               ii     .   This basic contribution rate is used in computing the employer s overall          contribution rate.                b   If the major industrial classification assigned to a new employer is an industry for          which a benefit cost rate does not exist because  such  the industry has not operated in the state          or has not been covered under this chapter, the employer s basic contribution rate shall be  .  .           This basic contribution rate is used in computing the employer s overall contribution rate.                   a   A reopening employer s basic contribution rate is the average overall contribution          rate for all employers in the state, but not less than   , until such time as the reopening employer          becomes a qualified employer as defined in Section   A      .               b   The average overall contribution rate for all employers in the state shall be defined by          rule.                       c   The reopening employer is an employer that is not substantially related to or affiliated         with the predecessor employer and that acquires, for the purpose of reopening, substantially all the         assets of a business or operating component of a business that has been closed or substantially         closed for    days or more of its normal operating period immediately prior to the acquisition.              d   A business or operating component of a business has been substantially closed if               i   its normal production has been stopped ,                ii   a majority of its workers have been laid off ,   and              iii   the services of remaining employees are devoted to the protection and disposition of         assets and inventory or administrative duties.                   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, and except as provided in          Subsection    , if an employing unit that moves into this state is declared to be a qualified          employer  by virtue of having  because it has sufficient payroll and benefit cost experience under          another state, a rate shall be computed on the same basis as a rate is computed for all other          employers subject to this chapter if that unit furnishes adequate records on which to compute the          rate.                   An employer who begins to operate in this state after having operated in another state          shall be assigned the maximum overall contribution rate until the employer acquires sufficient          experience in this state to be considered a  qualified employer  if the employer is                a   regularly engaged as a contractor in the construction, improvement, or repair of          buildings, roads, or other structures on lands                b   generally regarded as being a construction contractor or a subcontractor specialized in          some aspect of construction  or               c   required to have a contractor s license or similar qualification under Title   , Chapter            , Utah Construction Trades Licensing Act, or the equivalent in laws of another state.                   a   If an employer, other than a reopening employer,  has acquired  acquires the          business or all or substantially all the assets of another employer and the other employer had          discontinued operations upon the acquisition ,                 i   for purposes of determining and establishing the acquiring party s qualifications for an          experience rating classification, the payrolls of both employers during the qualifying period shall          be jointly considered in determining the period of liability with respect to                A   the filing of contribution reports ,                         B   the payment of contributions ,   and              C   after January  ,     , the benefit costs of both employers ,   and  the payrolls of both         employers during the qualifying period shall be jointly considered for the purpose of determining         and establishing the acquiring party s qualifications for an experience rating classification.  The               ii   the transferring employer shall be divested of  his  the transferring employer s payroll         experience.              b   Any employing unit or prospective employing unit that acquires the payroll experience         of an employer shall, for all purposes of this chapter, be an employer as of the date of acquisition.              c   Notwithstanding Section   A      , when  an  a transferring employer, as provided          in  this  Subsection     a ,  has been  is divested of  his  the employer s payroll experience by          transferring all of  his  the employer s business to another and by ceasing operations as of the date          of the transfer, the transferring employer shall cease to be an employer, as defined by this chapter,          as of the date of transfer.                    a   A rate of less than    shall be effective January   of any contribution year on or          after January  ,     , but before January  ,     , and a rate of less than the maximum overall          contribution rate on or after January  ,     , only with respect to new employers and to those          qualified employers who, except for amounts due under division determinations that have not          become final, paid all contributions prescribed by the division with respect to the four consecutive          calendar quarters in the fiscal year immediately preceding the computation date on or after January           ,     .               b   Notwithstanding Subsections    ,    ,    ,    , and    , on or after January  ,     , any          employer who fails to pay all contributions prescribed by the division with respect to the four          consecutive calendar quarters in the fiscal year immediately preceding the computation date,          except for amounts due under determinations that have not become final, shall pay a contribution          rate equal to the overall contribution rate determined under the experience rating provisions of this          chapter, plus  an additional  a surcharge of    of wages.               c    A qualified  Any employer who pays all required contributions shall, for the current          contribution year, be assigned a rate based upon  his  the employer s own experience as provided          under the experience rating provisions of this chapter effective the first day of the calendar quarter          in which the payment was made.               d   Delinquency in filing contribution reports shall not be the basis for denial of a rate less                  than the maximum contribution rate.
