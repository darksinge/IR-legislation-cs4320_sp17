If a parent has received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the                            parent has occurred, and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the                            physical presence of the alleged abuser, that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child                            is at substantial risk of being physically or sexually abused                                  d   the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child                                  e   the minor has been left without any provision for his support                                  f   a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for                            safe and appropriate care for the minor                                  g   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the parent                            is unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor, the whereabouts of the parent                            are unknown, and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful                                  h   the minor is in immediate need of medical care                                  i   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to                            the child s health or safety                                  j   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been neglected                                  k   the parent, or an adult residing in the same household as the parent, has been                            charged or arrested pursuant to Title   , Chapter   d, Clandestine Drug Lab Act, and any                            clandestine laboratory operation, as defined in Section          d      , was located in the residence                            or on the property where the child resided  or                                 l   the child s welfare is otherwise endangered.                                      a   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether                            reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from                            his home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued                            removal.  If the court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or                            guardian through the provision of those services,  it  the court shall place the minor with his                            parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division.                                 b   In making that determination, and in ordering and providing services, the child s                            health,  safety, and welfare shall be the paramount concern, in accordance with federal law.                                      Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency                            situation in which the child could not safely remain at home, the court shall make a finding that                            any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate.                                         In cases where actual sexual abuse or abandonment, or serious physical abuse or                            neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make  reasonable                            efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in his home, return a child to his                            home, provide reunification services, or attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.                                      The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of                            educational neglect as described in Subsection         a            s  ii .                                      a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section, it                            shall state the facts on which that decision is based.                                 b   If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home, the court shall                            state the facts on which that decision is based.                                      If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for                            the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned home, it shall                            order continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child, or the failure                            of a party to comply with notice provisions, or any other procedural requirement of this chapter                            or Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.

If that parent                            requests custody, the court shall place the minor with that parent unless it finds that the                            placement would be unsafe or otherwise detrimental to the child.  The provisions of this                            Subsection     are limited by the provisions of Subsection     b .                                 b   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section         a        , for purposes of this section                             natural parent  includes only a biological or adoptive mother, an adoptive father, or a                            biological father who was married to the child s biological mother at the time the child was                            conceived or born, or who has strictly complied with the provisions of Section            .       prior                            to removal of the child or voluntary surrender of the child by the custodial parent.  This                               definition applies regardless of whether the child has been or will be placed with adoptive                            parents or whether adoption has been or will be considered as a long term goal for the child.                                 c   i   The court shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that parent to                            assume custody, and the safety and appropriateness of the placement.                                 ii   The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to visit the parent s home,                            perform criminal background checks described in Sections         a    .      and       A  a    .     , and                            check the division s management information system for any previous reports of abuse or                            neglect received by the division regarding the parent at issue.                                 iii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any                            further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.                                 iv   The division shall report its findings in writing to the court.                                 v   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending its                            determination regarding that placement.                                     If the court orders placement with a parent under Subsection    , the child and the                            parent are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court.  The court may order that the parent                            assume custody subject to the supervision of the court, and order that services be provided to                            the parent from whose custody the child was removed, the parent who has assumed custody, or                            both.  The court shall also provide for reasonable parent time with the parent from whose                            custody the child was removed, unless parent time is not in the best interest of the child.  The                            court s order shall be periodically reviewed to determine whether                                  a   placement with the parent continues to be in the child s best interest                                  b   the child should be returned to the original custodial parent                                  c   the child should be placed with a relative or a friend, pursuant to Subsection      or                                 d   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                                     The time limitations described in Section         a         with regard to reunification                            efforts, apply to children placed with a previously noncustodial parent in accordance with                            Subsection    .                                     Legal custody of the child is not affected by an order entered under Subsection                                or    .  In order to affect a previous court order regarding legal custody, the party must petition                            that court for modification of the order.                                     a   i   If, at the time of the shelter hearing, a child is removed from the custody of                               his parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent, the court shall, at that time,                            determine whether  there is a relative who  a person described in Subsection                                  a            a  v  or, if practicable, a person described in Subsection         a            a  vi , is                            able and willing to care for the child.                                 ii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a                            reasonable search to determine whether  there are relatives of the child who are  a person                           described in Subsection         a            a  v  or, if practicable, a person described in Subsection                                  a            a  vi , is willing and appropriate, in accordance with the requirements of this part                            and Title   A, Chapter  a, Part  , Child Welfare Services, for placement of the child.  The                            court shall order the parents to cooperate with the division, within five working days, to                            provide information regarding relatives or a friend who may be able and willing to care for the                            child.                                 iii   The child may be placed in the temporary custody of the division pending the                            determination under Subsection     a  ii .                                 iv   This section may not be construed as a guarantee that an identified relative or                           friend will receive custody of the child.  However, preferential consideration shall be given  to                           a relative s request  for placement of the child with a person described in Subsection                                  a            a  v  or, if practicable, a person described in Subsection         a            a  vi , if                             it is in the best interest of the child, and  the provisions of this section are satisfied, unless the                           court finds that placement with a relative or friend is not in the best interest of the child.                                 b   i   If a willing relative or friend is identified pursuant to Subsection     a , the court                            shall make a specific finding regarding the fitness of that relative or friend to assume custody,                            and the safety and appropriateness of placement with that relative or friend.  In order to be                            considered a    willing relative    or friend under this section, the relative or friend shall be                            willing to cooperate if the child s permanency goal is reunification with his parent or parents,                            and be willing to adopt or take permanent custody of the child if that is determined to be in the                            best interest of the child.                                 ii   The court shall, at a minimum, order the division to conduct criminal background                            checks described in Sections         a    .      and       A  a    .     , visit the relative s or friend s                            home, check the division s management information system for any previous reports of abuse                            or neglect regarding the relative at issue, report its findings in writing to the court, and provide                               sufficient information so that the court may determine whether                                  A   the relative or friend has any history of abusive or neglectful behavior toward other                            children that may indicate or present a danger to this child                                  B   the child is comfortable with the relative                                  C   the relative or friend recognizes the parent s history of abuse and is determined to                            protect the child                                  D   the relative or friend is strong enough to resist inappropriate requests by the parent                            for access to the child, in accordance with court orders                                  E   the relative or friend is committed to caring for the child as long as necessary  and                                 F   the relative or friend can provide a secure and stable environment for the child.                                 iii   The court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any                            further investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement.                                 iv   The division shall complete and file its assessment regarding placement with a                            relative or friend as soon as practicable, in an effort to facilitate placement of the child with a                            relative or friend.                                 c   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division, pending the                            division s investigation pursuant to Subsection     b , and the court s determination regarding                            that placement.

In the case of a child defined as an  Indian  under                            the Indian Child Welfare Act,    U.S.C. Section     ,  relative  also means an  extended                            family member  as defined by that statute.                                     a   When the court vests physical custody of a child with a relative or friend                            pursuant to Subsection    , it shall order that the relative or friend assume custody subject to                            the continuing supervision of the court, and shall order that any necessary services be provided                            to the minor and the relative or friend.  That child is not within the temporary custody or                            custody of the Division of Child and Family Services.

The court may                            enter any order that it considers necessary for the protection and best interest of the child.  The                            court shall provide for reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody                            the child was removed unless parent time is not in the best interest of the child.                                 b   i   Placement with a relative or friend pursuant to Subsection     shall be                            periodically reviewed by the court, no less often than every six months, to determine whether                                  A   placement with the relative or friend continues to be in the child s best interest                                  B   the child should be returned home  or                                 C   the child should be placed in the custody of the division.                                 ii   No later than    months after placement with a relative or friend the court shall                            schedule a hearing for the purpose of entering a permanent order in accordance with the best                            interest of the child.                                 iii   The time limitations described in Section         a        , with regard to reunification                            efforts, apply to children placed with a relative or friend pursuant to Subsection    .                                     When the court orders that a child be removed from the custody of his parent and                            does not vest custody in another parent  or , a relative or friend under this section, the court                            shall order that the child be placed in the temporary custody of the Division of Child and                            Family Services, to proceed to adjudication and disposition and to be provided with care and                            services in accordance with this chapter and Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and Family Services.                                     a   Any preferential consideration that a relative or friend is initially granted                            pursuant to Subsection     expires     days from the date of the shelter hearing.  After that                            time period has expired, a relative or friend who has not obtained custody or asserted an                            interest in a child, may not be granted preferential consideration by the division or the court.                                 b   When the time period described in Subsection     a  has expired, the preferential                            consideration which is initially granted to a natural parent in accordance with Subsection    , is                            limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best interest of the                            child.
