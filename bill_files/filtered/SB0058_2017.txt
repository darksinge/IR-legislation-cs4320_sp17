Section        is amended to read                   . Powers of commissioner in possession    Sale of assets    Postpossession       financing    New deposit instruments    Executory contracts    Transfer of property          Avoidance of transfers    Avoidable preferences    Setoff.                 Upon taking possession of the institution, the commissioner may do all things       necessary to preserve its assets and business, and shall rehabilitate, reorganize, or liquidate the       affairs of the institution in a manner he determines to be in the best interests of the institution s       depositors and creditors.  Any such determination by the commissioner may not be overruled       by a reviewing court unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, fraudulent, or contrary to law.        In the event of a liquidation, he shall collect all debts due and claims belonging to it, and may       compromise all bad or doubtful debts.  He may sell, upon terms he may determine, any or all of       the property of the institution for cash or other consideration.  The commissioner shall give       such notice as the court may direct to the institution of the time and place of hearing upon an       application to the court for approval of the sale.  The commissioner shall execute and deliver to       the purchaser of any property of the institution sold by him those deeds or instruments       necessary to evidence the passing of title.                 With approval of the court and upon terms and with priority determined by the       court, the commissioner may borrow money and issue evidence of indebtedness.  To secure       repayment of the indebtedness, he may mortgage, pledge, transfer in trust, or hypothecate any       or all of the property of the institution superior to any charge on the property for expenses of       the proceeding as provided in Section       .  These loans may be obtained for the purpose of       facilitating liquidation, protecting or preserving the assets in the charge of the commissioner,       expediting the making of distributions to depositors and other claimants, aiding in the       reopening or reorganization of the institution or its merger or consolidation with another       institution, or the sale of all of its assets.  Neither the commissioner nor any special deputy or        other person lawfully in charge of the affairs of the institution is under any personal obligation        to repay those loans.  The commissioner may take any action necessary or proper to        consummate the loan and to provide for its repayment and to give bond when required for the        faithful performance of all undertakings in connection with it.  The commissioner or special        deputy shall make application to the court for approval of any loan proposed under this section.         Notice of hearing upon the application shall be given as the court directs.  At the hearing upon        the application any stockholder or shareholder of the institution or any depositor or other        creditor of the institution may appear and be heard on the application.  Prior to the obtaining of        a court order, the commissioner or special deputy in charge of the affairs of the institution may        make application or negotiate for the loan or loans subject to the obtaining of the court order.                  With the approval of the court pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation        under Section       , the commissioner may provide for depositors to receive new deposit        instruments from a depository institution that purchases or receives some or all of the assets of        the institution in the possession of the commissioner.  All new deposit instruments issued by        the acquiring depository institution may, in accordance with the terms of the plan of        reorganization or liquidation, be subject to different amounts, terms, and interest rates than the        original deposit instruments of the institution in the possession of the commissioner.  All        deposit instruments issued by the acquiring institution shall be considered new deposit        obligations of the acquiring institution.  The original deposit instruments issued by the        institution in the possession of the commissioner are not liabilities of the acquiring institution,        unless assumed by the acquiring institution.  Unpaid claims of depositors against the institution        in the possession of the commissioner continue, and may be provided for in the plan of        reorganization or liquidation.                  The commissioner, after taking possession of any institution or other person subject        to the jurisdiction of the department, may terminate any executory contract, including standby        letters of credit, unexpired leases and unexpired employment contracts, to which the institution        or other person is a party.  If the termination of an executory contract or unexpired lease        constitutes a breach of the contract or lease, the date of the breach is the date on which the        commissioner took possession of the institution.  Claims for damages for breach of an        executory contract shall be filed within    days of receipt of notice of the termination, and if        allowed, shall be paid in the same manner as all other allowable claims of the same priority out        of the assets of the institution available to pay claims.                  With approval of the court and upon a showing by the commissioner that it is in the        best interests of the depositors and creditors, the commissioner may transfer property on        account of an indebtedness incurred by the institution prior to the date of the taking.                  a   The commissioner may avoid any transfer of any interest of the institution in        property or any obligation incurred by the institution that is void or voidable by a creditor under        Title   , Chapter  , Uniform  Fraudulent Transfer  Voidable Transactions Act.              b   The commissioner may avoid any transfer of any interest in real property of the        institution that is void as against or voidable by a subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a        valuable consideration of the same real property or any portion thereof who has duly recorded        his conveyance at the time possession of the institution is taken, whether or not such a        purchaser exists.              c   The commissioner may avoid any transfer of any interest in property of the        institution or any obligation incurred by the institution that is invalid or void as against, or is        voidable by a creditor that extends credit to the institution at the time possession of the        institution is taken by the commissioner, and that obtains, at such time and with respect to such        credit, a judgment lien or a lien by attachment, levy, execution, garnishment, or other judicial        lien on the property involved, whether or not such a creditor exists.              d   The right of the commissioner under Subsections     b  and  c  to avoid any        transfer of any interest in property of the institution shall be unaffected by and without regard        to any knowledge of the commissioner or of any creditor of the institution.              e    Transfer  means every mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional, voluntary        or involuntary, or disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property,        including retention of title as a security interest.              f   The commissioner may avoid and recover any payment or other transfer of any        interest in property of the institution to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on account of an        antecedent debt owed by the institution before the transfer was made if the creditor at the time        of such transfer had reasonable cause to believe that the institution was insolvent, and if the        payment or other transfer will allow the creditor to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than        he would be entitled to under the provisions of Section       .  For the purposes of this        subsection               i   antecedent debt does not include earned wages and salaries and other operating        expenses incurred and paid in the normal course of business               ii   a transfer of any interest in real property is deemed to have been made or suffered        when it became so far perfected that a subsequent good faith purchaser of the property from the        institution for a valuable consideration could not acquire an interest superior to the transferee         and              iii   a transfer of property other than real property is deemed to have been made or        suffered when it became so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract could not acquire a        lien by attachment, levy, execution, garnishment, or other judicial lien superior to the interest        of the transferee.              g   For purposes of this section,  date of possession  means the earlier of the date the        commissioner takes possession of a financial institution under Title  , Chapter  , Possession of        Depository Institution by Commissioner, or the date when the commissioner enters an order        suspending payments to depositors and other creditors under Section       .                  a   With or without the prior approval of the court, the commissioner or any federal        deposit insurance agency appointed by him as receiver or liquidator of a depository institution        closed by the commissioner under the provisions of this chapter may setoff against the deposits        or other liabilities of the institution any debts or other obligations of the depositor or claimant        due and owing to the institution.  The amount of any setoff against the liabilities of the        institution shall be no greater than the amount the depositor or claimant would receive pursuant        to Section        after final liquidation of the institution.  When the liquidation value of a        depositor s or claimant s claim against the institution will or may be less than the full amount of        the claim, setoff may be made prior to final liquidation if the commissioner or any receiver or        liquidator appointed by him can reasonably estimate the liquidation value of the claim, and the        court, after notice and opportunity for hearing, approves the estimate for purposes of making        the setoff.  If the right of setoff is exercised, the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator        appointed by him shall give written notice to the depositor or claimant of the amount setoff.              b   The existence and amount of a debtor or creditor relationship or both, between the        institution and its depositor or claimant and the right to the proceeds in a deposit account shall        be determined solely by the books and records of the institution.              c   Any contract purporting to affect the right of setoff shall be in writing and signed by        the depositor debtor and an authorized officer of the institution and be maintained as a part of        the records of the institution.              d   Any claim that a deposit account is a special account not subject to setoff because it        was maintained for a specific purpose or to satisfy a particular obligation other than satisfaction        of or as security for an indebtedness to the institution or that the right to the deposit actually        belongs to a third party does not affect the right to setoff of the commissioner or any receiver or        liquidator appointed by him unless the special nature of the account is clearly shown in the        books and records of the institution.              e   In the absence of any other instrument in writing, the terms and provisions of the        signature card applicable to a particular account in effect at the time the commissioner takes        possession of the institution shall be determinative of the right of setoff by the commissioner or        any receiver or liquidator appointed by him.              f   Knowledge of the institution or of any director, officer, or employee of the        institution that the nature of the account is other than as shown in the books and records of the        institution does not affect the right of setoff by the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator        appointed by him.              g   The liability of the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him for        exercising a right of setoff other than as authorized by this section shall be only to a person        who establishes by the procedure set forth in Section       that his interest in the account is        superior to that of the person whose debt to the institution was setoff against the account.  The        amount of any such liability shall be no greater than the amount of the setoff and neither the        commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him shall be liable for any action taken        under this section unless the action taken is determined by the court to be arbitrary or        capricious.

As used in this section               a    Creditor  means               i   a creditor or other claimant of the settlor existing when the trust is created  or              ii   a person who subsequently becomes a creditor, including, whether or not reduced        to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,        undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured               A   one holding or seeking to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body        having adjudicative authority  or              B   one with a right to payment.              b    Property  means real property, personal property, and interests in real or personal        property.              c    Settlor  means a person who transfers property in trust.              d    Transfer  means any form of transfer of property, including gratuitous transfers,        whether by deed, conveyance, or assignment.              e    Trust  has the same meaning as in Section         .                   Paid and delivered  to the settlor, as beneficiary, does not include the settlor s use        or occupancy of real property or tangible personal property owned by the trust if the use or        occupancy is in accordance with the trustee s discretionary authority under the trust instrument.                  If the settlor of an irrevocable trust is also a beneficiary of the trust, and if the        requirements of Subsection     are satisfied, a creditor of the settlor may not               a   satisfy a claim or liability of the settlor in either law or equity out of the settlor s        transfer to the trust or the settlor s beneficial interest in the trust               b   force or require the trustee to make a distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary  or              c   require the trustee to pay any distribution directly to the creditor, or otherwise        attach the distribution before it has been paid or delivered by the trustee to the settlor, as        beneficiary.                  Notwithstanding Subsection    , nothing in this section prohibits a creditor from        satisfying a claim or liability from the distribution once it has been paid or delivered by the        trustee to the settlor, as beneficiary.                  In order for Subsection     to apply, the conditions in this Subsection     shall be        satisfied.  Where this Subsection     requires that a provision be included in the trust        instrument, no particular language need be used in the trust instrument if the meaning of the        trust provision otherwise complies with this Subsection    .              a   The trust instrument shall provide that the trust is governed by Utah law and is        established pursuant to this section.              b   The trust instrument shall require that at all times at least one trustee shall be a        Utah resident or Utah trust company, as the term  trust company  is defined in Section      .              c   The trust instrument shall provide that neither the interest of the settlor, as        beneficiary, nor the income or principal of the trust may be voluntarily or involuntarily        transferred by the settlor, as beneficiary.  The provision shall be considered to be a restriction        on the transfer of the settlor s beneficial interest in the trust that is enforceable under applicable        nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of Section     c     of the Bankruptcy Code.              d   The settlor may not have the ability under the trust instrument to revoke, amend, or        terminate all or any part of the trust, or to withdraw property from the trust, without the consent        of a person who has a substantial beneficial interest in the trust, which interest would be        adversely affected by the exercise of the power held by the settlor.              e   The trust instrument may not provide for any mandatory distributions of either        income or principal to the settlor, as beneficiary, except as provided in Subsection     f .              f   The settlor may not benefit from, direct a distribution of, or use trust property        except as stated in the trust instrument.  An agreement or understanding, express or implied,        between the settlor and the trustee that attempts to grant or permit the retention of greater rights        or authority than is stated in the trust instrument is void.              g   The trust instrument shall require that, at least    days before making any        distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary, the trustee notify in writing every person who has a        child support judgment or order against the settlor.  The trust instrument shall require that the        notice state the date the distribution will be made and the amount of the distribution.              h   At the time that the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not be in        default of making a payment due under any child support judgment or order.              i   A transfer of assets to the trust may not render the settlor insolvent.              j   At the time the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not intend to        hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor by transferring the assets to the trust.  A settlor s        expressed intention to protect trust assets from the settlor s potential future creditors is not        evidence of an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor.              k   At the time that the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not be        contemplating filing for relief under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.              l   Assets transferred to the trust may not be derived from unlawful activities.              m   At the time the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor shall sign a sworn        affidavit stating that               i   the settlor has full right, title, and authority to transfer the assets to the trust               ii   the transfer of the assets to the trust will not render the settlor insolvent               iii   the settlor does not intend to hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor by        transferring the assets to the trust               iv   there are no pending or threatened court actions against the settlor, except for those        court actions identified by the settlor on an attachment to the affidavit               v   the settlor is not involved in any administrative proceedings, except those        administrative proceedings identified on an attachment to the affidavit               vi   at the time of the transfer of the assets to the trust, the settlor is not in default of a        child support obligation               vii   the settlor does not contemplate filing for relief under the provisions of the        Bankruptcy Code  and              viii   the assets being transferred to the trust were not derived from unlawful activities.                  Failure to satisfy the requirements of Subsection     shall result in the        consequences described in this Subsection    .              a   If any requirement of Subsections     a  through  g  is not satisfied, none of the        property held in the trust will at any time have the benefit of the protections described in        Subsection    .              b   If the trustee does not send the notice required under Subsection     g , the court        may authorize any person with a child support judgment or order against the settlor to whom        notice was not sent to attach the distribution or future distributions, but the person may not               i   satisfy a claim or liability in either law or equity out of the settlor s transfer to the        trust or the settlor s beneficial interest in the trust  or              ii   force or require the trustee to make a distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary.              c   If any requirement set forth in Subsections     h  through  m  is not satisfied, the        property transferred to the trust that does not satisfy the requirement may not have the benefit        of the protections described in Subsection    .                  The provisions of Subsection     may apply to a trust even if               a   the settlor serves as a cotrustee or as an advisor to the trustee, provided that the        settlor may not participate in the determination as to whether a discretionary distribution will        be made               b   the settlor has the authority under the terms of the trust instrument to appoint        nonsubordinate advisors or trust protectors who can remove and appoint trustees and who can        direct, consent to, or disapprove distributions               c   the settlor has the power under the terms of the trust instrument to serve as an        investment director or to appoint an investment director under Section                        d   the trust instrument gives the settlor the power to veto a distribution from the trust               e   the trust instrument gives the settlor a testamentary nongeneral power of        appointment or similar power               f   the trust instrument gives the settlor the right to receive the following types of        distributions               i   income, principal, or both in the discretion of a person, including a trustee, other        than the settlor               ii   principal, subject to an ascertainable standard set forth in the trust               iii   income or principal from a charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable        remainder unitrust, as defined in    U.S.C.                   iv   a percentage of the value of the trust each year as determined under the trust        instrument, but not exceeding the amount that may be defined as income under    U.S.C.            b                v   the transferor s potential or actual use of real property held under a qualified        personal residence trust, or potential or actual possession of a qualified annuity interest, within        the meaning of    U.S.C.      and the accompanying regulations  and              vi   income or principal from a grantor retained annuity trust or grantor retained        unitrust that is allowed under    U.S.C.       or              g   the trust instrument authorizes the settlor to use real or personal property owned by        the trust.                  If a trust instrument contains the provisions described in Subsections     a  through         g , the transfer restrictions prevent a creditor or other person from asserting any cause of        action or claim for relief against a trustee of the trust or against others involved in the        counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of the trust for conspiracy to commit        fraudulent conveyance, aiding and abetting a fraudulent conveyance, participation in the trust        transaction, or similar cause of action or claim for relief.  For purposes of this subsection,        counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of the trust includes the preparation and        funding of a limited partnership, a limited liability company, or other entity if interests in the        entity are subsequently transferred to the trust.
