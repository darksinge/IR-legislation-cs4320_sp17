described in         Subsection     as advisory in determining whether or not execution of sentence should be         suspended and probation granted   The defendant is not required to satisfy all of those          circumstances for eligibility pursuant to this subsection       Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM    A limited legal review of this bill raises no obvious
