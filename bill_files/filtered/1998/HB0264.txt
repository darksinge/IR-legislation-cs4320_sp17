the child               Section     Section             is amended to read                             Responsibility of each party to protect his interests    Fraud no defense                    Each parent of a child conceived or born outside of marriage is responsible for his or          her own actions and is not excused from strict compliance with the provisions of this  chapter          based upon any action  statement  or omission of the other parent or third parties                           Any person injured by fraudulent representations or actions in connection with an         adoption is entitled to pursue civil or criminal penalties in accordance with existing law   A         fraudulent representation is not a defense to strict compliance with the requirements of this         chapter  and is not a basis for dismissal of a petition for adoption  vacation of an adoption decree          or an automatic grant of custody to the offended party   Custody determinations shall be based on         the best interest of the child  in accordance with the provisions of Section                              The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or misrepresentation         in adoption proceedings  and has provided a method for absolute protection of an unmarried         biological father s rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter   In balancing the rights          and interests of the state  and of all parties affected by fraud  specifically the child  the adoptive          parents  and the unmarried biological father  the Legislature has determined that the unmarried          biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate the effects of fraud and that           therefore  the burden of fraud shall be borne by him                    The Legislature finds that an unmarried biological father who resides in another state          may not  in every circumstance  be reasonably presumed to know of  and strictly comply with  the          requirements of this chapter   Therefore when all of the following requirements have been met  that          unmarried biological father may contest an adoption  prior to finalization of the decree of adoption           and assert his interest in the child  the court may then  in its discretion  proceed with an evidentiary          hearing under Subsection                              a   the unmarried biological father resides and has resided in another state where the          unmarried mother was also located or resided                b   the mother left that state without  notification or information to  notifying or informing          the unmarried biological father  regarding where  that she could be  contacted or  located in the          state of Utah                c   the unmarried biological father has  through every reasonable means  attempted to          locate the mother but  has been unable to do so  does not know or have reason to know that the          mother is residing in the state of Utah  and               d   the unmarried biological father has complied with the most stringent and complete          requirements of the state where the mother previously resided or was located  in order to protect          and preserve his parental interest and right in the child in cases of adoption                Legislative
