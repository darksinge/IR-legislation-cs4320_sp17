      misappropriation under Subsection                    Legislative Review Note      as of                  PM    This bill raises the following constitutional or statutory concerns        This bill is patterned after disclosure laws enacted in other states   The disclosure law of  one state  Massachusetts  has been challenged in court on the grounds that it       is preempted by  federal law      results in the taking of a trade secret without just compensation in violation of state  and federal constitutions  and     imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce    This bill  if challenged on similar grounds  would likely be upheld       The preemption challenge has been litigated and rejected in the Massachusetts Federal  District Court and  the First Circuit Court of Appeals   Phillip Morris  Inc  v  Massachusetts        U S  Dist  Lexis       Mass  D  C         aff d      F  d      st Cir          While this ruling  may not be conclusively binding on a Utah Federal District Court or the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals if this bill were challenged on preemption grounds  it is directly on point and creates          favorable precedence       The trade secret and interstate commerce challenges to Massachusetts  disclosure law have  not been fully resolved  although the district court has issued an order preventing the enforcement  of the law until full resolution occurs   Even without the benefit of a court decision directly on  point  it seems likely that this bill would successfully withstand a challenge on either ground if an  action were brought       First  the bill would likely withstand a trade secret challenge because disclosure is limited  to a nicotine yield rating and five known tobacco ingredients   More importantly  no disclosure is  required for any unknown tobacco ingredient  which a manufacturer may have a financial interest  in keeping secret from competitors  or for any formula  pattern  method  technique  or process for  producing a cigarette or tobacco product   See generally  Carson Products Company v  Califano       F  d       th Cir         Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides v  Browner       F  Supp       D D C         Mobay Chemical Corp  v  Costle      F  Supp       W D  Pa              Second  the bill would likely withstand an interstate commerce challenge because the  regulation of tobacco products comes within the State s general health and safety powers  the bill  is not a protectionist measure aimed at discriminating against interstate commerce  and disclosure   by itself  is not a unique or unreasonably heavy burden on interstate commerce   See generally  Manufacturers Ass n of Tri County v  Knepper      F  Supp        M D  Pa         aff d in part  and rev
