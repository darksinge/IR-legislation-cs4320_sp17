payment on behalf of the payees and deposit the monies in the court         treasury               b   The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the         warrant for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the taxpayer         is not required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar amount of         bail   In all other cases  the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not required to order         the withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the    day period  and the taxpayer         may be arrested on the warrant   However  the bail amount shall be reduced by the amount of tax          overpayment received by the court                c   If the taxpayer
