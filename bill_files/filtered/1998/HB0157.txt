of Utah               Section     Section    A         Effective           is amended to read                  A         Effective             Procedures governing meetings of judicial           nominating commissions                    The Judicial Council shall                a   enact rules establishing procedures governing the meetings of the judicial nominating          commissions  and               b   ensure that those procedures include                i   a minimum recruitment period of    days and a procedure to extend that period for an          additional    days if fewer than nine applications are received for a judicial vacancy                ii   standards for maintaining the confidentiality of the applications and related documents                iii   standards governing the release of applicant names before nomination                iv   standards for destroying the records of the names of applicants  applications  and          related documents upon

governing a nominating commissioner s disqualification and inability to         serve                   a   i   Except as provided in this Subsection     a  ii   if a judicial nominating         commission receives    or more applications to fill a judicial vacancy  the nominating commission         shall submit at least five names to the governor                ii   Notwithstanding Subsection     a  i   if five applicants do not receive the required          number of votes as specified in Subsection      c       from the nominating commission  the          commission shall submit only the names of applicants that received the required number of votes           but must submit the names of at least three applicants                b   In determining whether or not to submit an applicant s name to the governor  a          commission may not decline to consider an applicant merely because                i   the nominating commission had declined to submit that candidate s name to the          governor to fill a previous vacancy                ii   a previous nominating commission had declined to submit that candidate s name to the          governor  or               iii   that nominating commission or a previous nominating commission had submitted the          applicant s name to the governor and the governor selected someone else to fill the vacancy                 c   The vote required to submit an applicant s name to the governor is as follows                  i   if all seven members of the nominating commission are present and considering          applicants  a vote in favor of the applicant by four commissioners submits the candidate s name          to the governor                  ii   if only six members of the nominating commission are present and considering          applicants because one member is unable to attend  has recused himself or is otherwise          disqualified  a vote in favor of the applicant by four commissioners submits the candidate s name          to the governor                  iii   if only five members of the nominating commission are present and considering          applicants because two members are unable to attend  have recused themselves  or are otherwise                 disqualified  a vote in favor of the applicant by three commissioners submits the candidate s name         to the governor  and                iv   if only four members of the nominating commission are present and considering         applicants because three members are unable to attend  have recused themselves  or are otherwise         disqualified  a vote in favor of the applicant by three commissioners submits the candidate s name         to the governor                    a   Voting for the selection of nominees may differ from voting during the screening         process   Voting may occur in one or two more rounds  depending on the outcome of each round           Each commissioner is allotted a number of votes for each round equal to the number of nominees          remaining to be selected   For the selection of nominees for a trial court  each commissioner has          five votes during the first round   If one nominee is selected during the first round  each          commissioner has four votes during the next round   If there are multiple vacancies  the number          of votes allotted to each commissioner during each round of voting is multiplied by the number          of vacancies  and the commission selects nominees as a pool without matching any vote or any          candidate to a particular vacancy                b   Voting is by confidential ballot                c   A commissioner may not cast more than one vote for a single candidate during any          single round of voting                d   A commissioner must cast all allotted votes in each round                e   Any candidate receiving in any round a number of votes one less than the number of          voting commissioners present is selected as a nominee   If  after any round of voting  a candidate          receives two or fewer votes  the candidate is removed from consideration during subsequent          rounds of voting   The commission should further debate the qualifications of candidates who are          neither selected nor removed from consideration before conducting the next round of voting            Voting and discussion continues until the requisite number of nominees have been selected                f   The commission can reconsider its action on any candidate upon a majority vote to do          so                g   If after full deliberation the commission is unable to agree upon the required number          of nominees in the above described manner  those candidates not removed from consideration shall          be considered to be tied within the meaning of Section   A            and the commission may          certify up to two additional names                       h   The total vote tally  but not the vote of individual commissioners  is recorded in the         minutes   After the vote tallies are verified and recorded  the ballots are destroyed                   Unless the commission determines that there are not five qualified applicants  a list of         five names shall be certified to the governor for his selection  but in no event shall fewer than three         names be certified                   The governor may reject the initial list sent by the commission and request a new list          but the timelines for selection remain as provided by the Utah Constitution                         A judicial nominating commission may not nominate a justice or judge who was         not retained by the voters for the office for which the justice or judge was defeated until after the          expiration of that term of office                          Judicial nominating commissions are exempt from the requirements of Title              Chapter    Open and Public Meetings  and Title     Chapter   a  Utah Administrative Rulemaking          Act               Section      Effective date               This act takes effect on July
