to read                            Calculation of obligations                      The parents  child support obligation shall be divided between them in proportion to          their adjusted gross incomes  unless the low income table is applicable                    Except in cases of joint physical custody and split custody as defined in Section                  and in cases where the obligor

combined child support          obligation by multiplying the combined child support obligation by each parent s percentage of          combined adjusted gross income                    In the case of an incapacitated adult child  any amount that the adult child can          contribute toward his or her support should be applied to defray the cost borne by the adult child s          parents and should be determined as follows                a   reduce the total child support obligation by the amount the adult child is able to          contribute toward the adult child s own support  and               b   calculate each parent s proportionate share of the base combined child support          obligation  using the parents  respective incomes only  by multiplying the combined child support                 obligation by each parent s percentage of combined adjusted income                         In cases where the monthly adjusted gross income of the obligor is between              and         the base child support award shall be the lesser of the amount calculated in accordance         with Subsection     and the amount calculated using the low income table                         The base combined child support obligation table provides combined child         support obligations for up to six children   For more than six children  additional amounts may be         added to the base child support obligation shown   Unless rebutted by Subsection                       the amount ordered shall not be less than the amount which would be ordered for up to six         children                          If the monthly adjusted gross income of the obligor is      or less  the court or          administrative agency shall determine the amount of the child support obligation on a case by case          basis  but the base child support award shall not be less than                              The amount shown on the table is the support amount for the total number of          children  not an amount per child        Legislative Review Note      as of                  AM    A limited legal review of this bill raises no obvious constitutional or statutory concerns    Office
