member of the parent s household  or other person known to the parent   If a parent has          received actual notice that physical or sexual abuse by a person known to the parent has occurred                   and there is evidence that the parent has allowed the child to be in the physical presence of the         alleged abuser  that fact constitutes prima facie evidence that the child is at substantial risk of         being physically or sexually abused               d   the parent is unwilling to have physical custody of the child               e   the minor has been left without any provision for his support               f   a parent who has been incarcerated or institutionalized has not or cannot arrange for         safe and appropriate care for the minor               g   a relative or other adult custodian with whom the minor has been left by the parent is         unwilling or unable to provide care or support for the minor  the whereabouts of the parent are          unknown  and reasonable efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful                h   the minor is in immediate need of medical care                i   the physical environment or the fact that the child is left unattended poses a threat to          the child s health or safety                j   the minor or another minor residing in the same household has been  severely           neglected  or               k   the child s welfare is otherwise endangered                    The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether reasonable          efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the minor from his home and          whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued removal   If the          court finds that the minor can be safely returned to the custody of his parent or guardian through          the provision of those services  it shall place the minor with his parent or guardian and order that          those services be provided by the division                     Where the division s first contact with the family occurred during an emergency          situation in which the child could not safely remain at home  even with reasonable services being          provided  the court shall make a finding that any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was          reasonable                     In cases where obvious sexual abuse or abandonment  or serious physical abuse or          neglect are involved  neither the division nor the court has any duty to maintain a child in his          home  return a child to his home  provide reunification services  or attempt to rehabilitate the          offending parent or parents   The court may  however  determine that those services or efforts          would be reasonable in specific circumstances  and order the division to provide those services                             The court may not order continued removal of a minor solely on the basis of         educational neglect as described in Subsection     a        q  ii                     a   Whenever a court orders continued removal of a minor under this section  it shall         state the facts on which that decision is based               b   If no continued removal is ordered and the minor is returned home  the court shall state         the facts on which that decision is based                    If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody is necessary for the         protection of a child because harm may result to the child if he were returned home  it shall order         continued removal regardless of any error in the initial removal of the child  or the failure of a          party to comply with notice provisions  or any other procedural requirement of this chapter or Title            A  Chapter  a  Family Services               Section      Section      a     is amended to read                    a       Shelter hearing    Placement with a

accordance with the requirements of Section     a      the court shall          first determine whether  there is  reasonable efforts have been made to identify or locate and          provide notice to another natural parent as defined in Subsection  b   with whom the child was not          residing at the time the events or conditions that brought him within the court s jurisdiction          occurred  who desires to assume custody of the child   If that parent requests custody  the court          shall place the minor with that parent unless it finds that the placement would be unsafe or          otherwise detrimental to the child    The provisions of this Subsection     are limited by the          provisions of Subsection     b     Any preferential consideration for custody that may be granted          to a natural parent pursuant to this subsection expires    days from the date of the shelter hearing            After that time the court shall base its custody decision solely on

parent  whose consent for adoption would          be required pursuant to Section             who was married to the child s biological mother at          the time the child was conceived or born  or who has strictly complied with the provisions of          Section            prior to removal of the child or voluntary surrender of the child by the          custodial parent   This definition applies regardless of whether the child has been or will be placed                  with adoptive parents or whether adoption has been or will be considered as a long term goal for         the child

orders placement with a parent under Subsection      the child and the          parent are under the continuing jurisdiction of the court   The court may order that the parent          assume custody subject to the supervision of the court  and order that services be provided to the          parent from whose custody the child was removed  the parent who has assumed custody  or both            The court may also provide for reasonable visitation with the parent from whose custody the child          was removed  if that is in the best interest of the child   The court s order shall be periodically          reviewed to determine whether                a   placement with the parent continues to be in the child s best interest                b   the child should be returned to the original custodial parent                c   the child should be placed with a relative  pursuant to Subsection      or               d   the child should be placed in the custody of the division

custody  the party must petition that          court for modification of the order                    a   If  at the time of the shelter hearing  a child is removed from the custody of his                  parent and is not placed in the custody of his other parent  the court shall  at that time  attempt to         determine whether there is a relative who is able and willing to care for the child   The court may         order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct a reasonable search to determine         whether there are relatives of the child who are willing and appropriate  in

consideration may be given to a relative s         request for placement of the child  if it is in the best interest of the child  and the provisions of this          section are satisfied

and          appropriateness of placement with that relative   In order to be considered a  willing relative           under this section  the relative shall be willing to cooperate if the child s permanency goal is          reunification with his parent or parents  and be willing to adopt or take permanent custody of the          child if that is determined to be in the best interest of the child                ii   The court shall  at a minimum  order the division to conduct criminal background          checks described in Sections     a       and   A  a        visit the relative s home

may indicate or present a danger to this child                B   the child is comfortable with the relative                C   the relative recognizes the parent s history of abuse and is determined

court may order the Division of Child and Family Services to conduct any further                  investigation regarding the safety and appropriateness of the placement               c   The court may place the child in the temporary custody of the division  pending the         division s investigation pursuant to Subsection  b   and the court s determination regarding that         placement
