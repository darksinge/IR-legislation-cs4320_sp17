his liability under this part is not liable for claims for         contribution regarding matters addressed in the agreement or order                b   i   An agreement or order determining liability under this part does not discharge any          of the liability of responsible parties who are not parties to the agreement or order  unless the terms          of the agreement or order expressly provide otherwise                ii   An agreement or order determining liability made under this subsection reduces the          potential liability of other responsible parties by the amount of the agreement or order                    a   If the executive secretary obtains less than complete relief from a party who has          resolved his liability under this section  the executive secretary may bring an action against any          party who has not resolved his liability as determined in an order                b   In apportioning liability  the standards of Subsection     apply                c   A party who resolved his liability for some or all of the costs under this part may seek          contribution from any person who is not a party to the agreement or order
