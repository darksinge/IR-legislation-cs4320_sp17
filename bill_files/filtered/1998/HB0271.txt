 potential harm to the privacy interest of the individual                    An order under this section which authorizes the disclosure of private genetic          information shall                a

research project includes analysis of DNA from family members for pedigree         analysis or linkage analysis               a   the Institutional Review Board  in addition to making the determinations required in         Subsection      shall require               i   that education and counseling regarding how pedigree analysis is conducted and the         kind of information that results from such analysis is provided to research subjects  and              ii   that as far as practicable separate records are maintained on each subject  and              b   a research subject  prior to participation and in addition to the disclosures required by         Section            shall be informed                i   that one risk of participation is that by the end of the project other family members may          learn private genetic information about the individual                ii   of what will be done with records and data generated during the project  and
