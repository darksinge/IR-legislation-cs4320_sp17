but temporarily live          elsewhere  to the same extent as the named insured                    A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection            A           a  may                a   provide for the prorating of the insurance under that policy with other valid and          collectible insurance                b   grant any lawful coverage in addition to the

deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section   A                          A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage imposes on the insurer the duty         to defend  in good faith  any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit seeking         damages which would be payable under the policy                   a   If a policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage provides an insurer with the         defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured  that defense is not effective against a third          person making a claim against the insurer  unless there was collusion between the third person and          the insured                b   If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant  after          payment  the insurer is subrogated to the injured person s claim against the insured to the extent          of the payment and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has          been made whole with respect to the claim against the insured                    A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection   A           may          specifically exclude from coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured s household           including a person who usually makes his home in the same household but temporarily lives          elsewhere  if each person excluded from coverage satisfies the owner s or operator s security          requirement of Section      a      independently of the named insured s proof of owner s or          operator s security               Section     Section    A        is enacted to read                  A           Recovery for noneconomic damages    Limitations    Exceptions
