already received and yet to be received.                                     a  Subject to the notice requirement of Subsection     b , each local political                            subdivision and private entity intending to impose an impact fee shall prepare a written analysis                            of each impact fee that                                  i   identifies the impact on system improvements required by the development activity                                  ii   demonstrates how those impacts on system improvements are reasonably related to

development activity, the local political subdivision or private                            entity, as the case may be, shall identify, if applicable                                  i   the cost of existing public facilities                                  ii   the manner of financing existing public facilities, such as user charges, special                            assessments, bonded indebtedness, general taxes, or federal grants                                  iii   the relative extent to which the newly developed properties and other properties                            have already contributed to the cost of existing public facilities, by such means as user charges,                            special assessments, or payment from the proceeds of general taxes

future                                  v   the extent to which the newly developed properties are entitled to a credit because                            the local political subdivision or private entity, as the case may be, requires its developers or                            owners, by contractual arrangement or otherwise, to provide common facilities, inside or                            outside the proposed development, that have been provided by the local political subdivision or                            private entity, respectively, and financed through general taxation or other means, apart from                            user charges, in other parts of the service area                                  vi   extraordinary costs, if any, in servicing the newly developed properties  and                                 vii   the time price differential inherent in fair comparisons of amounts paid at                            different times.
