failure of a respondent to appear at a scheduled evidentiary hearing                             after receiving proper notice is an admission of the charged violation.                                  c   The validity of any hearing is not affected by the failure of any person to attend or                             remain in attendance.                                  d   All evidentiary

Any district                             court within the judicial district in which a person alleged to be guilty of willful contempt of                             court or refusal to obey a subpoena is found or resides, upon application by the party issuing                             the subpoena, may issue an order requiring the person to appear before the issuing party, and to                             produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence regarding the matter in                             question.  Failure to obey an order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.                                  g   In all cases heard by a hearing examiner, the hearing examiner shall prepare a                             report to the commission.

agreement  means a written agreement                             between the division, through its director, and the licensee, which specifies formal terms and                             conditions the licensee must fulfill in order to comply with the diversion program.                                  b   i   A diversion agreement shall contain a full detailed statement of the requirements                             agreed to by the licensee and a full detailed stipulation of the facts upon which the diversion                             agreement is premised.                                  ii   The facts stipulated in the diversion agreement shall constitute binding admissions                             of the licensee                                   A   in any proceeding under Subsection     c  or     d  to terminate the diversion                             agreement and impose disciplinary sanctions against the licensee  and                                  B   in any

agreement shall provide that if the licensee makes an intentional                             material misrepresentation of fact in the stipulation of facts contained in the diversion                             agreement, the director shall initiate the procedures set forth in Subsection      to terminate the                             diversion agreement and issue an order of license revocation.                                  d   i   The diversion agreement shall provide that if the licensee fails to comply with its                             terms, the director shall initiate the

include as probationary requirements any terms of                             the diversion agreement it does not consider necessary to protect the public.                                     iii   The term of the order of probation shall be as provided in Subsection      c  ii .                                  e   The division director may not approve a diversion agreement unless the licensee, as                             part of the diversion agreement                                   i   knowingly and intelligently waives the right to a hearing under Title   , Chapter                               b, Administrative Procedures Act, for the conduct upon which the diversion agreement was                             premised                                   ii   agrees to be subject to the procedures and remedies set forth in this section                                   iii   acknowledges an understanding of the consequences of making an intentional                             misrepresentation of fact in the stipulation of facts contained in the diversion agreement  and                                  iv   acknowledges an understanding of the consequences of failing to comply with the                             terms of the diversion agreement.                                      a   If the division and the licensee enter into a diversion agreement after the                             division has commenced an adjudicative proceeding against the licensee, the director shall stay                             that proceeding pending completion of the diversion agreement.                                  b   The order staying the adjudicative proceeding shall be filed in that proceeding and                             may reference the diversion agreement.                                      a   Upon successful completion of a diversion agreement, the director shall dismiss                             any charges under the director s jurisdiction of unprofessional or unlawful conduct that were                             filed against the licensee.                                  b   Whether or not an adjudicative proceeding had been commenced against the                             licensee, the division may not thereafter subject the licensee to disciplinary action for the                             conduct which formed the basis of the completed diversion agreement.                                  c   Neither the execution of a diversion agreement nor the dismissal of filed charges                             constitute disciplinary action, and no report of either may be made to disciplinary databases.                                  d   The division may consider the completion of a diversion program and the contents                             of the diversion agreement in determining the appropriate disciplinary action if the licensee is                             charged in the future with the same or similar conduct.                                  e   The order of dismissal shall be filed in the adjudicative proceeding in which the                                misconduct was charged and may reference the diversion agreement.                                      a   Acceptance of the licensee into diversion does not preclude the division from                             investigating or continuing to investigate the licensee for any unlawful or unprofessional                             conduct committed before, during, or after participation in the diversion program.                                  b   Acceptance of the licensee into diversion does not preclude the division from                             taking disciplinary action or continuing to take disciplinary action against the licensee for                             unlawful or unprofessional conduct committed before, during, or after participation in the                             diversion program, except for that conduct which formed the basis for the diversion agreement.                                  c   Any licensee terminated from the diversion program for failure to comply with the                             diversion agreement is subject to disciplinary action by the division for acts committed before,                             during, and after participation in the diversion program, including violations identified in the                             diversion agreement.                                       The classification, retention, and disclosure of records relating to a licensee s                             participation in the diversion program is governed by Title   , Chapter  , Government Records                             Access and Management Act, except that any provision in the diversion agreement which                             addresses access to or release of diversion records regarding the licensee shall govern the                             access to and release of those records.                                       Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the fact that the licensee                             completed a diversion program and the contents of the diversion agreement itself may be                             considered by the division in determining the appropriate disciplinary action if the licensee is                             charged in the future with the same or similar conduct.                                       Meetings regarding the diversion program are not subject to Title   , Chapter  ,                             Open and Public Meetings Act.                                       a   If, during the course of the diversion agreement, information is brought to the                             attention of the director that the licensee made an intentional material misrepresentation of fact                             in the stipulation of facts contained in the diversion agreement, the director shall cause to be                             served upon the licensee an order to show cause specifying the information relied upon by the                             director and setting a time and place for hearing to determine whether or not the licensee made                                the intentional material misrepresentation of fact and whether the agreement should be                             terminated on that ground.                                  b   Proceedings to terminate a diversion agreement on the grounds that the licensee                             made an intentional material misrepresentation of fact in the stipulation of facts contained in                             the diversion agreement and to issue an order of license revocation shall comply with Title   ,                             Chapter   b, Administrative Procedures Act, except as follows                                   i   the notice of agency action shall be in the form of an order to show cause, which                             shall contain all of the information specified in Subsection          b         , except a statement that                             a written response to the order to show cause is required                                   ii   no written response to the order to show cause is required                                   iii   discovery is prohibited, but the division may issue subpoenas or other orders to                             compel production of necessary evidence on behalf of either party and all parties shall have                             access to information contained in the division s diversion file to the extent permitted by law                                   iv   the hearing shall be held only after timely notice to all parties  and                                  v   any agency review or reconsideration of an order terminating a diversion agreement                             or of an order of license revocation pursuant to this Subsection      shall be limited to the                             division director s findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order which arose out of the order                             to show cause proceeding.                                  c   Upon finding the licensee made an intentional material misrepresentation of fact in                             the stipulation of facts contained in the diversion agreement and that terminating the agreement                             is in the best interest of the public, and issuing an order to that effect, the director shall issue an                             order of license revocation, revoking the licensee s professional license.                                  d   The order terminating the diversion agreement and the order of license revocation                             shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law as determined by the director following                             the hearing or as otherwise stipulated and agreed to by the parties.

adjudicative proceeding shall                             be considered to be merged into the order of license revocation and it may not constitute a basis                                for any separate disciplinary action against the licensee.                                  f   The order terminating the diversion agreement and the order of license revocation                             shall notify the licensee of the right to request agency review or reconsideration.                                       a   If, during the course of the diversion agreement, information is brought to the                             attention of the director that the licensee has violated the diversion agreement and if it appears                             in the best interest of the public to

                                 e   If the diversion agreement being terminated was entered into after the division had                             commenced an adjudicative proceeding against the

cause to be served upon                             the licensee an order to show cause why the probation should not be terminated and the stay of                             suspension lifted.

to determine whether or not the licensee has                             violated the order of suspension and probation and whether that order should be terminated and                             the
