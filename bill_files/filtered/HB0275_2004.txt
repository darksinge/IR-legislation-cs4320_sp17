Prior to finalization of a petition for adoption the court shall review and                            consider the information and recommendations contained in the preplacement and                            postplacement adoptive studies required by this section.

Each parent of a child conceived or born outside of marriage is responsible for his                            or her own actions and is not excused from strict compliance with the provisions of this                             chapter based upon any action, statement, or omission of the other parent or third parties.                                     Any person injured by fraudulent representations or actions in connection with an                            adoption is entitled to pursue civil or criminal penalties in accordance with existing law.  A                            fraudulent representation is not a defense to strict compliance with the requirements of this                            chapter, and is not a basis for dismissal of a petition for adoption, vacation of an adoption                            decree, or an automatic grant of custody to the offended party.  Custody determinations shall be                            based on the best interest of the child, in accordance with the provisions of Section            .      .                                     The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or                            misrepresentation in adoption proceedings, and has provided a method for absolute protection                            of an unmarried, biological father s rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  In                            balancing the rights and interests of the state, and of all parties affected by fraud, specifically                            the child, the adoptive parents, and the unmarried, biological father, the Legislature has                            determined that the unmarried, biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate                            the effects of fraud and that, therefore, the burden of fraud shall be borne by him.                                      The Legislature finds that an unmarried biological father who resides in another                           state may not, in every circumstance, be reasonably presumed to know of, and strictly comply                           with, the requirements of this chapter.  Therefore when all of the following requirements have                           been met, that unmarried biological father may contest an adoption, prior to finalization of the                           decree of adoption, and assert his interest in the child  the court may then, in its discretion,                              proceed with an evidentiary hearing under Subsection            .                                             a   the unmarried biological father resides and has resided in another state where the                           unmarried mother was also located or resided                                    b   the mother left that state without notifying or informing the unmarried biological                           father that she could be located in the state of Utah                                    c   the unmarried biological father has, through every reasonable means, attempted to                           locate the mother but does not know or have reason to know that the mother is residing in the                           state of Utah  and                                   d   the unmarried biological father has complied with the most stringent and complete                           requirements of the state where the mother previously resided or was located, in order to                           protect and preserve his parental interest and right in the child in cases of adoption.                                 Section  .    Section           .       is amended to read                                         .  .  Contested adoptions    Rights of parties    Determination of custody.                                      Whenever any party contests an adoption, the court shall first determine whether                           the provisions of this chapter have been complied with.  If a party who was entitled to notice                           and consent under the provisions of this chapter, was denied that right, and did not otherwise                           waive or forfeit that right  under the terms of this chapter, the court may                                    a   enjoin the adoption, or dismiss the adoption petition, and proceed in accordance                           with Subsection      or                                   b   determine whether proper grounds for termination of that parent s rights exist and,                           if so, order that the parent s rights be terminated in accordance with the provisions of this                           chapter or Title   , Chapter  a, Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act.                                       a   In any case, and under any circumstance, if a court determines that a petition                           for adoption may not be granted, the court may not automatically grant custody of a child to a                           challenging biological parent, but shall conduct an evidentiary hearing in each case, in order to                           determine who should have custody of the child, in accordance with the child s best interest.                                   b   Evidence considered at that hearing may include, but is not limited to, evidence of                           psychological or emotional bonds that the child had formed with third parties and any                           detriment that a change in custody may cause to the child.  The fact that a person relinquished a                           child to a licensed child placing agency or executed a consent for adoption may not be                           considered by the court as evidence of neglect or abandonment.                                         If a person whose consent for an adoption is required pursuant to Subsection                                     .          b ,  c ,  d ,  e , or  f  refused to consent, the court shall determine whether                           proper grounds exist for the termination of that person s rights pursuant to the provisions of this                           chapter or Title   , Chapter  a, Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act.                                     If there are proper grounds to terminate the person s parental rights, the court shall                           order that the person s rights be terminated.  If there are not proper grounds to terminate the                           person s parental rights, the court shall                                  a   dismiss the adoption petition  and                                 b   conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine who should have custody of the child                           and award custody in accordance with the child s best interest.                                     Evidence considered at the custody hearing may include evidence of psychological                           or emotional bonds that the child has formed with a third person, including the prospective                           adoptive parent, and any detriment that a change in custody may cause the child.                                     The fact that a person relinquished a child to a licensed child placing agency or                           consented to the adoption may not be considered as evidence that the person                                  a   is unfit or incompetent to be a parent                                  b   has neglected or abandoned the child                                  c   is not interested in having custody of the child  or                                 d   should not be granted custody because based on any of the above considerations it                           would not be in the child s best interest.                                  c        Any custody order entered pursuant to this section may also include provisions                            for parent time by a biological parent or visitation by an interested third party, and provide for                            the financial support of the child.                                     If a person or entity whose consent is required for an adoption under Subsection                                     .          a  or  g  refuses to consent, the court shall proceed with an evidentiary hearing                           and award custody as set forth in Subsection    .  The court may also finalize the adoption if                           doing so is in the best interest of the child.                                           An adoption may not be contested after the final decree of adoption is entered.                                Section  .
