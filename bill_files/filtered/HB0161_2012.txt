Section      A  a         is amended to read                                   A  a    .  Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of                           state.                                    a   Under both the United States Constitution and the constitution of this state, a                           parent possesses a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of the                           parent s children.  A fundamentally fair process must be provided to parents if the state moves                           to challenge or interfere with parental rights.  A governmental entity must support any actions                           or allegations made in opposition to the rights and desires of a parent regarding the parent s                           children by sufficient evidence to satisfy a parent s constitutional entitlement to heightened                           protection against government interference with the parent s fundamental rights and liberty                           interests.                                b   The fundamental liberty interest of a parent concerning the care, custody, and                           management of the parent s children is recognized, protected, and does not cease to exist                           simply because a parent may fail to be a model parent or because the parent s child is placed in                           the temporary custody of the state.  At all times, a parent retains a vital interest in preventing                           the irretrievable destruction of family life.  Prior to an adjudication of unfitness, government                           action in relation to parents and their children may not exceed the least restrictive means or                           alternatives available to accomplish a compelling state interest.  Until the state proves parental                              unfitness, the child and the child s parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous                           termination of their natural relationship and the state cannot presume that a child and the child s                           parents are adversaries.                                c   It is in the best interest and welfare of a child to be raised under the care and                           supervision of the child s natural parents.  A child s need for a normal family life in a                           permanent home, and for positive, nurturing family relationships  will usually  is best  be  met                           by the child s natural parents, except in extreme cases where additional assistance may be                          needed.  Additionally, the integrity of the family unit ,  and the right of parents to conceive and                           raise their children  have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth                          Amendment to the United States Constitution  are constitutionally protected.  The right of a                            fit, competent  parent to raise the parent s child without undue government interference is a                           fundamental liberty interest that has long been protected by the laws and Constitution  of this                          state and of the United States  and is a fundamental public policy of this state.                                d   The state recognizes that                                 i   a parent has the right, obligation, responsibility, and authority to raise, manage,                           train, educate, provide for, and reasonably discipline the parent s children  and                                ii   the state s role is secondary and supportive to the primary role of a parent.                                e   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty                           to exercise primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of their                           children.                                f   Subsections     through     shall be interpreted and applied consistent with this                           Subsection    .                                    It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection                           from abuse and neglect, and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating,                           prosecuting, and punishing abuse and neglect, as defined in this chapter, and in Title   A,                           Chapter  , Juvenile Court Act of     .  Therefore, the state, as parens patriae, has an interest in                           and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately provide                           for their welfare.  There may be circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a                           substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and                           proper parental care and protection.  Under those circumstances, the state may take limited                           action for the welfare and protection of the parent s children.                                       When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused, neglected, or dependent child,                           it shall take into account the child s verified need for protection from immediate harm and the                          extent to which the child s extended family may provide needed protection.  Throughout its                           involvement, the division shall utilize the least intrusive and least restrictive means available to                           protect a child, in an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable, permanent families,                           rather than in temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state.                                    When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s immediate safety                           or welfare, the division may  obtain  seek temporary custody of the child for a  planned                           limited period and place the child in a safe environment, subject to the requirements of this                          section and in accordance with the requirements of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Abuse,                            Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.                                     In determining and making  reasonable efforts  with regard to a child, pursuant to                            the provisions of Section       A  a        , both the division s and the court s paramount concern                            shall be the child s health, safety, and welfare, and the constitutionally protected rights of                           parents.  The desires of a parent for the parent s child shall be given full and serious                            consideration by the division and the court.                                     In cases where actual sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe                            abuse, or severe neglect are established, the state has no duty to make  reasonable efforts  or                            to, in any other way, attempt to maintain a child in the child s home, provide reunification                            services, or to attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.  This Subsection     does                            not exempt the division from providing court ordered services.                                     a    It is the division s obligation, under federal law, to  The division shall strive to                            achieve appropriate permanency for children who are abused, neglected, or dependent.  The                           division shall provide in home services in an effort to help a parent to correct the behavior that                           resulted in abuse, neglect, or dependency of the parent s child.  If in home services fail or are                           otherwise insufficient or inappropriate, the division shall also seek extended family support or                           a kinship placement to maintain a sense of security and stability for the child.  If in home                           services and kinship placement fail and cannot be corrected, the division may pursue a foster                           placement.                                 b   If the use or continuation of  reasonable efforts,  as described in Subsections                                and    , is determined to be inconsistent with the permanency plan for a child, then measures                               shall be taken, in a timely manner, to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan,                            and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.                                  b   If,   c   Subject to the parental rights recognized and protected under this section,                           if,  because of a parent s conduct or condition, the parent is conclusively determined to be unfit                            or incompetent based on the grounds for termination of parental rights described in Title   A,                            Chapter  , Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act, the continuing welfare and best interest                            of the child  is of paramount importance, and shall govern  shall be protected in determining                            whether that parent s rights should be terminated.

Subject to Subsections     and    , if the court determines that reunification                            services are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family, the court shall provide for                            reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,                            unless parent time is not in the best interest of the minor.                                     In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe                            abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make                             reasonable efforts  or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to                            attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.

With regard to a minor who is    months of age or younger at the time the minor                            is initially removed from the home, the court shall                                  a   hold a permanency hearing  eight     months after the date of the initial removal,                            pursuant to Section       A            and                                 b   order the discontinuance of those services after  eight     months from the initial                            removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                            to comply with the child and family plan.

There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                            parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following                            circumstances exist                                  a   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit                            indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                  b   subject to Subsection      a , the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such                            magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                  c   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,                            sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor                                  i   was removed from the custody of the minor s parent                                  ii   was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent  and                                 iii   is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual                            exploitation                                  d   the parent                                  i   caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect  or                                 ii   committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit                                  A   murder or manslaughter of a child  or                                    B   child abuse homicide                                  e   the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the                            parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the                            minor                                  f   the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,                            and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the                            offending parent                                  g   the parent s rights are terminated with regard to any other minor                                  h   the minor is removed from the minor s home on at least two previous occasions and                            reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times                                  i   the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer                                  j   the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a                            location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation                            was located                                  k   except as provided in Subsection      b , with respect to a parent who is the child s                            birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome or was exposed to an illegal or prescription                            drug that was abused by the child s mother while the child was in utero, if the child was taken                            into division custody for that reason, unless the mother agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled                            in, or has recently and successfully completed a substance abuse treatment program approved                            by the department  or                                 l   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification                            efforts or services.                                      a   The finding under Subsection      b  shall be based on competent evidence                            from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing                            that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately                            caring for the minor within    months after the day on which the court finding is made.                                 b   A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection      k  if the court finds, under                            the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection                                 k  is not warranted.

Recognition of rights of parents and children    Judicial process for                            termination    Parent unfit or incompetent    Best interest of child.                                     The state may only terminate parental rights in extreme cases and after fully and                           fairly exhausting all reasonably available alternatives and using the least restrictive means as                           required to satisfy the constitutional protection of parental rights, and to achieve the strong                           public policy in favor of strengthening and uniting families and avoiding or minimizing                           removal of a child from the home of the parent to the fullest extent possible.                                     In no event may parental rights be terminated without fully satisfying Section                                A  a        .                                     The state shall provide a parent with reasonably sufficient time and support to                           prevent or correct conditions that may otherwise cause a parent to be charged with unfitness                           and loss of the parent s child.                                     The state shall make all reasonable efforts to avoid removing a child from the                           custody of the child s parent and the child s home.                                     When a child is removed from the custody of a parent, the state shall earnestly                           strive to reunify the family.                                     No federal law, mandate, regulation, or financial contribution to the state shall be                           allowed to interfere with or undermine parental rights and the public policy of this state.                                     When conditions arise that may limit a parent s ability to care and provide for a                           child, grandparents, extended family, and kin who are willing and able to provide family                           support are entitled to offer and provide support without interference from the state.                                     Temporary deficiencies of a parent are not grounds for permanent termination of                           parental rights.                                        The court may not impose a premature or fixed time limit on the continuing                           progress of a parent who earnestly seeks to improve the parent s parenting abilities and protect                           the best interests of the parent s child.  The state shall be a support and not a threat thereto.                                            This part provides a judicial process for voluntary and involuntary severance                            of the parent child relationship, designed to safeguard the rights and interests of all parties                            concerned and promote their welfare and that of the state.                                            Wherever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved, but if a                            parent is found, by reason of  his  the parent s conduct or condition, to be unfit or incompetent                            based upon any of the grounds for termination described in this part, the court shall then                           balance and consider the welfare and best interest of the child  of paramount importance  in                            determining whether termination of parental rights shall be ordered.
