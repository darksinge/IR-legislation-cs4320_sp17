The state finds with respect to the grazing zones described in Subsection     that               a   agricultural livestock industry on the lands comprising these zones has provided a        significant contribution to the history, customs, culture, economy, welfare, and other values of        each area for more than     years               b   the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exists within these zones        if managed properly, that will support and expand continued, responsible agricultural livestock        activities and wildlife habitat               c   agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources,        human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural resources, landmarks,        structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition,        preservation, and protection               d   i   the highest management priority for lands within these zones is the preservation,        restoration, and enhancement of watershed and rangeland health to sustain and expand forage        production for both livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, and the restoration and development        of historic, existing, and future livestock grazing and wildlife habitat resources in order to        provide protection for the resources, objects, customs, culture, and values identified above  and              ii   notwithstanding Subsection     d  i , if part or all of any zone lies within a sage        grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with        the management priorities set forth in Subsection     d  i  to the maximum extent consistent        with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area               e   subject to Subsection     d  ii , responsible development of any deposits of energy        and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold,        uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in        these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these        zones  and              f   subject to Subsection     d  ii , responsible development of any recreation        resources, including roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use, sightseeing,        canyoneering, hunting, fishing, trapping, and hiking resources that may exist in these grazing        zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these grazing        zones.                  The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection     that the        historic levels of livestock grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection     in each        zone have greatly diminished, or are under other serious threat, due to               a   unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies,        including               i   de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non WSAs               ii   ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interior        applicable to each of these zones  and              iii   the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage               b   inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each year        proven to be most effective for maintaining and enhancing rangeland conditions               c   mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage by        excess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery counties               d   improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion, invasive        species, and juniper, and other woody vegetation that               i   compromise watershed and rangeland health               ii   crowd out grazing forage               iii   degrade habitat and limit wildlife populations               iv   reduce water yield  and              v   heighten the risk of catastrophic wildfire  and              e   other practices that degrade overall rangeland health.                  To protect and preserve against the threats described in Subsection    , the state        supports the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection                   a   efficient and sustained policies, programs, and practices directed at preserving,        restoring, and enhancing watershed and rangeland health to maximize               i   all permitted forage production for livestock grazing and other compatible uses,        including flexible grazing on and off dates adaptive to yearly climate and range conditions  and              ii   forage for fish and wildlife               b   a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and local        government agencies to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development        of               i   forage resources for grazing livestock and wildlife  and              ii   other uses compatible with livestock grazing and wildlife utilization               c   effective and responsible management of wild horses and burros to eliminate excess        populations  and              d   effective and responsible management of wildlife habitat.                  The state requests that the federal agencies that administer lands within each        grazing zone               a   fully cooperate and coordinate with the state and the respective counties within        which each grazing zone is situated to develop, amend, and implement land and resource        management plans, and implement management decisions that are consistent with the        purposes, goals, and policies described in this section to the maximum extent allowed under        federal law               b   expedite the processing, granting, and streamlining of grazing permits, range        improvements, and applications to enhance and otherwise develop all existing and permitted        grazing resources located within each grazing zone, including renewable vegetative resources               c   allow continued maintenance and increased development of roads, power lines,        pipeline infrastructure, and other utilities necessary to achieve the goals, purposes, and policies        described in this section and consistent with multiple use and sustained yield principles               d   refrain from any planning decisions and management actions that will undermine,        restrict, or diminish the goals, purposes, and policies for each grazing zone as stated in this        section               e   subject to Subsection     d  ii , refrain from implementing a policy that is contrary        to the goals and purposes described within this section  and              f   refrain from implementing utilization standards less than    , unless               i   implementing a standard of less than     utilization on a temporary basis is        necessary to resolve site specific concerns  and              ii   the federal agency consults, coordinates, and cooperates fully with local        governments.                  a   If a grazing zone described in Subsection     is managed or neglected in such a        way as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a        county or a county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk adversely affects the health,        safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock        grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that adverse effect               i   Subsections              a  and  b  shall govern and apply to the chief executive        officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in        the grazing zone  and              ii   Subsection              b  shall govern and apply to the attorney general with        respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing zone.              b   If a grazing zone described in Subsection     is managed or neglected in such a way        as to increase the risk of catastrophic wildfire, and if the chief executive officer of a county or a        county sheriff finds that the catastrophic wildfire risk constitutes an imminent threat to the        health, safety, and welfare of the people of the political subdivision and that increased livestock        grazing in part or all of the grazing zone would substantially reduce that imminent threat               i   Subsections              and     shall govern and apply to the chief executive        officer and the county sheriff with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in        the grazing zone  and              ii   Subsection              and Section           shall govern and apply to the        attorney general with respect to making increased livestock grazing available in the grazing        zone.                  a   The state recognizes the importance of all grazing districts on Utah BLM and        Forest Service lands but establishes the grazing zones described in Subsection     to provide        special protection and preservation against the identified threats found in Subsection     to        exist in these zones.              b   It is the intent of the state to designate additional grazing agricultural commodity        zones in future years, if circumstances warrant special protection and preservation for new        zones.                   The state calls upon applicable federal, state, and local agencies to coordinate with        each other and establish applicable intergovernmental standing commissions, with membership        consisting of representatives from the United States government, the state, and local        governments to coordinate and achieve consistency in planning decisions and management        actions in zones described in Subsection     in order to achieve the goals, purposes, and        policies described in this section.                   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, and subject to Subsection            d  ii , the state s mineral, oil, gas, and energy policies and plans on land within the zones        described in Subsection     shall be governed by Sections   J       and   J      .Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
