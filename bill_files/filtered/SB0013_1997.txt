Section      b  .  is amended to read                  b  . .  Interconnection.                   a    i   The commission may require any telecommunications corporation to        interconnect its essential facilities with another telecommunications corporation that provides        public telecommunications services in the same, adjacent, or overlapping service territory.             ii   Interconnecting telecommunications corporations shall permit the mutual exchange        of traffic between their networks without unreasonable blocking or other unreasonable restrictions        on the flow of traffic.  In determining unreasonable blocking or unreasonable restrictions, the        commission shall, among other things, take into account the necessity and time required for        adapting the network to respond to significant changes in usage patterns.             b   i   Whenever the commission grants a certificate to one or more telecommunications        corporations to provide public telecommunications services in the same or overlapping service        territories, all telecommunications corporations providing public telecommunications services in          the affected area shall have the right to interconnect with the essential facilities and to purchase the        essential services of all other certificate holders operating in the same area on a nondiscriminatory        and reasonably unbundled basis.             ii   Each telecommunications corporation shall permit access to and interconnection with        its essential facilities and the purchase of its essential services on terms and conditions, including        price, no less favorable than those the telecommunications corporation provides to itself and its        affiliates.             c   Nothing in this section  shall prevent a telecommunications corporation from entering        into nondiscriminatory agreements for interconnection with its essential facilities and the purchase        and sale of essential services.             d   i   A telecommunications corporation shall file with the commission the prices, terms,        and conditions of any agreement it makes for the interconnection of essential facilities or the        purchase or sale of essential services.             ii   The agreement shall take effect ten days after filing.             iii   Each telecommunications corporation shall allow any other telecommunications        corporation to obtain interconnection with its essential facilities and to purchase essential services        on prices, terms, and conditions no less favorable than those on file with the commission.             e   If there is a dispute over interconnection of essential facilities  or , the purchase and sale        of essential services, or the planning or provisioning of facilities or unbundled elements, one or both        of the disputing parties may bring the dispute to the commission, and the commission, by order, shall        resolve the dispute on an expedited basis.             f   It is not a discriminatory pricing practice to vary prices to reflect genuine cost differences.                 a   The commission shall adopt rules or issue an interim order which implements by        December   ,     , the competitive provision of facilities based intraLATA toll and local exchange        services.             b   The rules or interim order shall address those issues the commission determines are        essential for a competing telecommunications corporation to provide intraLATA toll and local        exchange services and necessary to protect the public interest, including the interconnection with                essential facilities and the purchase and sale of essential services of telecommunications corporations        authorized to provide public telecommunications services in the same or overlapping service        territories on a nondiscriminatory and reasonably unbundled basis.                 a   By December   ,     , the commission shall adopt additional rules or issue a  final        order to implement the competitive provision of facilities based intraLATA toll and local exchange        services.             b   The rules or final order shall address other issues relating to              i   competition for intraLATA toll and local exchange services              ii   blocking, timing of provisioning of unbundled elements, and service quality standards        for interconnecting carriers               ii    iii   the transition to a competitive market  and              iii    iv   the protection of the public interest.                 Nothing in this section shall require or prohibit the commission from ordering changes        in dialing patterns for intraLATA toll services.                 If the commission, by order, approves the application of a telecommunications        corporation to provide public telecommunications services in all or part of the service territory        certificated to an incumbent telephone corporation before the adoption of the rules or final order        described in Subsection    , the commission may              a   order the interconnection of essential facilities and the purchase and sale of the essential        services of a telecommunications corporation with those of a competing telecommunications        corporation on such terms and conditions and to the extent necessary to allow the competing        telecommunications corporation to operate under authority granted by the commission  and             b   address and resolve, by order, other issues  necessary for the competitive provision of        intraLATA toll and local exchange services.             Section  .  Section      b  .  is amended to read                  b  . .  Price regulation    Maximum prices.                 The Legislature finds that              a   traditional rate of return regulation cannot guarantee that customers who do not have the                choice of alternative providers will be protected from the economic responsibility for making up for        an incumbent telephone corporation s competitive losses or from providing for the recovery of past,        regulated investments              b   the method of regulation set forth in this section will provide better protection to        customers who lack competitive choices than does traditional rate of return regulation  and             c   before moving from traditional rate of return regulation, it is essential the commission        address issues relating to the movement of prices towards cost and removing subsidies in the existing        price structure of incumbent telephone corporations to encourage competition for all        telecommunications services.                 a   Effective May  ,     , any incumbent telephone corporation with more than   ,           access lines in the state shall be regulated pursuant to this section and may not be regulated on the        basis of rate of return or any similar method of regulation that is based on the earnings of the        incumbent telephone corporation, except as provided in this section.             b   Any incumbent telephone corporation serving fewer than   ,    access lines in the state        may petition the commission to be regulated under price regulation  rather than traditional rate of        return regulation.  In adopting price regulation for incumbent telephone corporations with fewer than          ,    access lines, the commission may modify the provisions of this section taking into        consideration the individual circumstances of the incumbent telephone corporation seeking price        regulation.                 a   Any general rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than          ,    access lines in the state initiated before May  ,     , shall be based on a      test period and        shall be conducted under the principles of traditional rate of return regulation, even though the final        order in the case is not issued until May  ,     , or thereafter.             b   A rate proceeding for an incumbent telephone corporation with more than   ,    access        lines in the state may be initiated after April   ,     , and before March  ,     .             i   The rate proceeding shall be revenue neutral relative to the last proceeding filed pursuant        to Subsection     a , except that the commission may increase or decrease the revenue anticipated        from all rates to account for changes in the following factors which are known and measurable at the                time of hearings in the case              A   any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone        corporation required by federal or state law or approval by the commission              B   changes in rules of the Federal Communications Commission, including rules with        regard to the separation of interstate and intrastate revenues, expenses, or investments              C   changes in tax rates applied to the incumbent telephone corporation              D   any other change external to the business operations of the incumbent telephone        corporation resulting from              I   accounting rules adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and approved by        the commission  or             II   laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction  or             E   any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April   ,     .             ii   In the rate proceeding, the commission may also rebalance rates of particular services        to move rates of those services toward cost.                 a   The prices of tariffed telecommunications services offered by an incumbent telephone        corporation with more than   ,    access lines in the state may not increase during the three year        period commencing with the date of the final order in the last rate case initiated  before May  ,     .         The prices of services offered pursuant to a price list or competitive contract shall be governed by        Section     b  . .             b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a , prices may increase pursuant to any prices        established in a final order of the commission for a  general  rate proceeding initiated before  May         March  ,            , or the adjustment of those prices as a result of an appeal or remand of the        final order.                 a   Effective at the end of the three year period specified in Subsection    , the        commission shall regulate the maximum prices for the tariffed public telecommunications services        of the incumbent telephone corporation according to an aggregate price index or price indices        associated with groups of services.  The aggregate price index or price indices shall be adjusted        annually to reflect the effects of inflation, productivity, and exogenous factors and to maintain an                appropriate level of service quality.  The precise manner of annual adjustment shall be developed        by the commission after notice and a hearing and before the end of the three year period.             b   Factors in the price index or price indices may also include the following              i   any removal of subsidies in the existing price structure of the incumbent telephone        corporation required by federal or state law or approved by the commission              ii   the impact of alteration in asset lives to better reflect changes in the economic lives of        plant and equipment approved by the commission consistent with Section        .               iii   changes in rules of the Federal Communications Commission, including rules with        regard to the separation of interstate and intrastate revenues, expenses, or investments adopted by        the commission              iv   changes in tax rates applied to the incumbent telephone corporation              v   any other change external to the business operations of the incumbent telephone        corporation resulting from              A   accounting rules adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and approved        by the commission  or             B   laws or rules enacted or adopted by a governmental entity having jurisdiction  or             vi   any other extraordinary events not reasonably foreseeable as of April   ,     .                 a   The incumbent telephone corporation may decrease the price of a tariffed        telecommunications service subject to the limitation in Section     b  . .             b   Any decrease in price shall be made by filing a tariff with the commission.  The decrease        shall become effective    days after filing.
