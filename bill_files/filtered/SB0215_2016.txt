Urquhart      House Sponsor   V. Lowry Snow             LONG TITLE      General Description            This bill amends motor vehicle insurance provisions relating to subrogation.       Highlighted Provisions             This bill                   modifies the rights of subrogation on the part of an underinsured motorist carrier        and                  makes technical changes.       Money Appropriated in this Bill             None       Other Special Clauses             None       Utah Code Sections Affected        AMENDS               A       . , as last amended by Laws of Utah     , Chapters     and     and       further amended by Revisor Instructions, Laws of Utah     , Chapters     and                   Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah             Section  .  Section   A       .  is amended to read               A       . . Underinsured motorist coverage.                 As used in this section              a    Covered person  has the same meaning as defined in Section   A       .             b   i    Underinsured motor vehicle  includes a motor vehicle, the operation,       maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time of an injury causing       occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the injured party       for all special and general damages.             ii   The term  underinsured motor vehicle  does not include              A   a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same policy that       also contains the underinsured motorist coverage              B   an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection   A            or             C   a motor vehicle owned or leased by              I   a named insured              II   a named insured s spouse  or             III   a dependent of a named insured.                 a   Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection   A           c  provides       coverage for a covered person who is legally entitled to recover damages from an owner or       operator of an underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.             b   A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or furnished       to the covered person, the covered person s spouse, or covered person s resident relative may       recover underinsured benefits only if the motor vehicle is              i   described in the policy under which a claim is made  or             ii   a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the       policy.                 a   For purposes of this Subsection    ,  new policy  means              i   any policy that is issued that does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an       existing policy  or             ii   a change to an existing policy that results in              A   a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy  or             B   a change in the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle liability coverage.              a    b   For new policies written on or after January  ,     , the limits of underinsured       motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle       liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the       insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy, unless a named insured rejects or       purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form that              i   is filed with the department              ii   is provided by the insurer              iii   waives the higher coverage              iv   need only state in this or similar language that  underinsured motorist coverage       provides benefits or protection to you and other covered persons for bodily injury resulting       from an accident caused by the fault of another party where the other party has insufficient       liability insurance   and             v   discloses the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist       coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle       liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the       insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.              b    c   Any selection or rejection under Subsection      a   b  continues for that       issuer of the liability coverage until the insured requests, in writing, a change of underinsured       motorist coverage from that liability insurer.              c    d   i   Subsections      a   b  and   b    c  apply retroactively to any claim arising       on or after January  ,     , for which, as of May   ,     , an insured has not made a written       demand for arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.             ii   The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsections      a   b  and         b    c  clarifies legislative intent and does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights.              d   For purposes of this Subsection    ,  new policy  means                i   any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an       existing policy  or               ii   a change to an existing policy that results in                A   a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy  or               B   a change in the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle liability coverage.              e   i   As used in this Subsection     e ,  additional motor vehicle  means a change       that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include       replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.             ii   The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or       commercial lines policy does not constitute a new policy for purposes of Subsection      d   a .             iii   If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where       underinsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where underinsured motorist limits are       lower than the named insured s motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice       to a named insured within    days that              A   in the same manner described in Subsection      a   b  iv , explains the purpose of       underinsured motorist coverage  and             B   encourages the named insured to contact the insurance company or insurance       producer for quotes as to the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist       coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle        liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the        insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.              f   A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under        Subsection      d   a  ii  does not constitute a new policy.              g   i   Subsection      d   a  applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after        January  ,      for which, as of May  ,     , an insured has not made a written demand for        arbitration or filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.              ii   The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection      d   a                A   does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights  and              B   clarifies legislative intent.              h   A self insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide underinsured        motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self insured retention under        Subsections      a   b  and  l  by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement from        the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the               i   self insured entity s coverage level  and              ii   process for filing an underinsured motorist claim.              i   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than               i      ,    for one person in any one accident  and              ii   at least    ,    for two or more persons in any one accident.              j   An acknowledgment under Subsection      a   b  continues for that issuer of the        underinsured motorist coverage until the named insured, in writing, requests different        underinsured motorist coverage from the insurer.              k   i   The named insured s underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection           , is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motor        vehicle, as described in Subsection    .              ii   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage of        the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with,        or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motor        vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.              l   i   In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January  ,     , for        policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium        renewal notice, an explanation of               A   the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage in the same manner as described in        Subsection      a   b  iv   and              B   a disclosure of the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist        coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle        liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the        insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.              ii   The disclosure required under this Subsection     l  shall be sent to all named        insureds that carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the named        insured s motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage        limits available by the insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.              m   For purposes of this Subsection    , a notice or disclosure sent to a named insured        in a household constitutes notice or disclosure to all insureds within the household.                  a   i   Except as provided in this Subsection    , a covered person injured in a        motor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not elect        to collect underinsured motorist coverage benefits from another motor vehicle insurance policy.              ii   The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motor        vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance        coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.              iii   Subsection     a  ii  applies to all persons except a covered person described        under Subsections     b  i  and  ii .              b   i   Except as provided in Subsection     b  ii , a covered person injured while        occupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to the        covered person, the covered person s spouse, or the covered person s resident parent or resident        sibling, may also recover benefits under any one other policy under which the covered person is        also a covered person.              ii   A   A covered person may recover benefits from no more than two additional        policies, one additional policy from each parent s household if the covered person is               I   a dependent minor of parents who reside in separate households  and              II   injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or        furnished to the covered person, the covered person s resident parent, or the covered person s        resident sibling.              B   Each parent s policy under this Subsection     b  ii  is liable only for the        percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent s policy of underinsured        motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents  underinsured coverage applicable to the        accident.              iii   A covered person s recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full        amount of damages.              iv   Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident is        primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections          A           a ,  b , and  c  is secondary coverage.              v   The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other.              vi   A covered person as described under Subsection     b  i  is entitled to the highest        limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per household        applicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative.              vii   A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections if        recovery is unavailable under previous elections.              viii   A   As used in this section,  interpolicy stacking  means recovering benefits for a        single incident of loss under more than one insurance policy.              B   Except to the extent permitted by this Subsection    , interpolicy stacking is        prohibited for underinsured motorist coverage.              c   Underinsured motorist coverage               i   is secondary to the benefits provided by Title   A, Chapter  , Workers         Compensation Act               ii   may not be subrogated by a workers  compensation insurance carrier               iii   may not be reduced by benefits provided by workers  compensation insurance               iv   may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person is        made whole               v   may not be collected for bodily injury or death sustained by a person               A   while committing a violation of Section     a                    B   who, as a passenger in a vehicle, has knowledge that the vehicle is being operated        in violation of Section     a       or              C   while committing a felony  and              vi   notwithstanding Subsection     c  v , may be recovered               A   for a person under    years of age who is injured within the scope of Subsection            c  v , but is limited to medical and funeral expenses  or              B   by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section          , who is injured        within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer s duties.                  The inception of the loss under Subsection   A           for underinsured        motorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.                  a    Within  Except as provided in Subsection     d , within five business days        after notification that all liability insurers have tendered  their liability  the liability insurers         policy limits, the underinsured carrier shall either               i   waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the person        liable for the injuries caused in the accident  or              ii   pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability carrier.              b   If neither option is exercised under Subsection     a , the subrogation claim is        considered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.              c   The notification under Subsection     a  shall include               i   the name, address, and phone number for all liability insurers               ii   the liability insurers  liability policy limits  and              iii   the claim number associated with each liability insurer.              d   i   A claimant may demand payment of policy limits from all liability insurers by        sending notice to all applicable underinsured motorist insurers demanding payment.              ii   The notice under Subsection     d  i  shall include the name, address, and claim        number of all liability insurers from which the claimant has demanded policy limits.              iii   The claimant shall send a copy of the notice to all liability insurers from which the        claimant has demanded policy limits.              e   Upon the liability insurer tendering limits to a claimant, the liability insurer shall        provide notice of the tender to all underinsured motorist insurers for which the liability insurer        received notice under Subsection     d .              f   If a claimant accepts the policy limits tender of each liability insurer, the liability        insurer shall pay the claimant the accepted policy limits.              g   i   The subrogation rights of an underinsured motorist insurer are waived, unless               A   within five days of delivery of the notice of tender from the liability insurer, the        underinsured motorist insurer affirmatively asserts the underinsured motorist insurer s rights to        subrogation by delivering notice to the liability insurer of the underinsured motorist insurer s        rights to subrogate  and              B   the underinsured motorist insurer reimburses the liability insurer for the policy        limits paid to the claimant.              ii   If the subrogation rights of an underinsured motorist insurer are not waived under        Subsection     g  i , any liability release signed by the claimant or the claimant s representative        is rescinded.              iii    A claimant s underinsured motorist coverage is preserved if the claimant provides        notice to the underinsured motorist insurer as described in Subsection     d  .              h   A person providing a notice required in this Subsection     shall deliver the notice        by a service that provides proof of delivery.                  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a covered person may seek, subject to        the terms and conditions of the policy, additional coverage under any policy               a   that provides coverage for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents  and              b   that is not required to conform to Section   A       .                  a   When a claim is brought by a named insured or a person described in        Subsection   A           and is asserted against the covered person s underinsured motorist        carrier, the claimant may elect to resolve the claim               i   by submitting the claim to binding arbitration  or              ii   through litigation.              b   Unless otherwise provided in the policy under which underinsured benefits are        claimed, the election provided in Subsection     a  is available to the claimant only, except that        if the policy under which insured benefits are claimed provides that either an insured or the        insurer may elect arbitration, the insured or the insurer may elect arbitration and that election to        arbitrate shall stay the litigation of the claim under Subsection     a  ii .              c   Once a claimant elects to commence litigation under Subsection     a  ii , the        claimant may not elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration under this section        without the written consent of the underinsured motorist coverage carrier.              d   i   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, a claim that is submitted to        binding arbitration under Subsection     a  i  shall be resolved by a single arbitrator.              ii   All parties shall agree on the single arbitrator selected under Subsection     d  i .              iii   If the parties are unable to agree on a single arbitrator as required under Subsection            d  ii , the parties shall select a panel of three arbitrators.              e   If the parties select a panel of three arbitrators under Subsection     d  iii                i   each side shall select one arbitrator  and              ii   the arbitrators appointed under Subsection     e  i  shall select one additional        arbitrator to be included in the panel.              f   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing               i   each party shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator selected        under Subsection     d  i   or              ii   if an arbitration panel is selected under Subsection     d  iii                A   each party shall pay the fees and costs of the arbitrator selected by that party  and              B   each party shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator selected        under Subsection     e  ii .              g   Except as otherwise provided in this section or unless otherwise agreed to in        writing by the parties, an arbitration proceeding conducted under this section is governed by        Title   B, Chapter   , Utah Uniform Arbitration Act.              h   i   The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with Rules    a     through  f ,           through   ,   , and    of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, once the requirements of        Subsections     a  through  c  are satisfied.              ii   The specified tier as defined by Rule    c     of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure        shall be determined based on the claimant s specific monetary amount in the written demand        for payment of uninsured motorist coverage benefits as required in Subsection     a  i  A .              iii   Rules   .  and   .  of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to        arbitration claims under this part.              i   An issue of discovery shall be resolved by the arbitrator or the arbitration panel.              j   A written decision by a single arbitrator or by a majority of the arbitration panel        constitutes a final decision.              k   i   Except as provided in Subsection    , the amount of an arbitration award may        not exceed the underinsured motorist policy limits of all applicable underinsured motorist        policies, including applicable underinsured motorist umbrella policies.              ii   If the initial arbitration award exceeds the underinsured motorist policy limits of all        applicable underinsured motorist policies, the arbitration award shall be reduced to an amount        equal to the combined underinsured motorist policy limits of all applicable underinsured        motorist policies.              l   The arbitrator or arbitration panel may not decide an issue of coverage or        extra contractual damages, including               i   whether the claimant is a covered person               ii   whether the policy extends coverage to the loss  or              iii   an allegation or claim asserting consequential damages or bad faith liability.              m   The arbitrator or
