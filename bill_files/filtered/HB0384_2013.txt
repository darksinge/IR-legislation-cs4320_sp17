A claimant may file an answer to a complaint for civil forfeiture without posting                           bond with respect to the property subject to forfeiture.                                Section   .    Section                 is enacted to read                                         .  Criminal forfeiture procedure.                                     If a claimant is criminally prosecuted for conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, the                           prosecuting attorney may elect to seek forfeiture of the claimant s interest in the property                           through the criminal case.                                     If the prosecuting attorney elects to seek forfeiture of the claimant s interest in the                           property through the criminal case, the information or indictment shall state that the claimant s                           interest in the property is subject to forfeiture and the basis for the forfeiture.                                     a   Upon application of the prosecuting attorney, the court may enter restraining                              orders or injunctions, or take other reasonable actions to preserve for forfeiture under this                           section, any property subject to forfeiture if, after notice to known claimants and claimants who                           can be identified after due diligence and who are known to have an interest in the property, and                           after affording those persons an opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that                                  i   there is a substantial probability that the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture                           and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being sold, transferred, destroyed,                           or removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture  and                                 ii   the need to preserve the availability of the property or prevent its sale, transfer,                           destruction, or removal through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship against                           any party against whom the order is to be entered.                                 b   A temporary restraining order may be entered ex parte upon application of the                           prosecuting attorney before or after an information or indictment has been filed with respect to                           the property, if the prosecuting attorney demonstrates that                                  i   there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is                           sought would, in the event of a conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section  and                                 ii   provision of notice would jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture                           or would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.                                 c   The temporary order expires not more than    days after entry unless extended for                           good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension.                                 d   After service of the temporary order upon any claimants known to the prosecuting                           attorney, a hearing concerning the order entered under this section shall be held as soon as                           practicable and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.                                 e   The court is not bound by the Utah Rules of Evidence regarding evidence it may                           receive and consider at any hearing under this section.                                     a   Upon conviction of a claimant for conduct giving rise to criminal forfeiture, the                           prosecutor shall ask the finder of fact to make a specific finding as to whether the property or                           any part of it is subject to forfeiture.                                 b   A determination of whether property is subject to forfeiture under this section shall                           be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.                                     a   Upon conviction of a claimant for violating any provision of state law                           subjecting a claimant s property to forfeiture and a finding by the trier of fact that the property                              is subject to forfeiture, the court shall enter a judgment and order the property forfeited to the                           state upon the terms stated by the court in its order.                                 b   Following the entry of an order declaring property forfeited, the court may, upon                           application of the prosecuting attorney, enter appropriate restraining orders or injunctions,                           require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators,                           appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the state in                           property ordered forfeited.                                     a   i   After property is ordered forfeited under this section, the seizing agency shall                           direct the disposition of the property under Section                 .                                 ii   Any property right or interest under this Subsection     a  not exercisable by or                           transferable for value to the state expires and does not revert to the defendant.                                 iii   The defendant or any person acting in concert with or on behalf of the defendant is                           not eligible to purchase forfeited property at any sale held by the seizing agency unless                           approved by the judge.                                 b   The court may stay the sale or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of                           any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture if the defendant demonstrates that                           proceeding with the sale or disposition of the property may result in irreparable injury, harm, or                           loss.                                     Except as provided under Subsection     or     , a party claiming an interest in                           property subject to forfeiture under this section                                  a   may not intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving the forfeiture of                           property under this section  and                                 b   may not commence an action at law or equity concerning the validity of the party s                           alleged interests in the property subsequent to the filing of an indictment or an information                           alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this section.                                     The district court that has jurisdiction of a case under this part may enter orders                           under this section without regard to the location of any property that may be subject to                           forfeiture under this section or that has been ordered forfeited under this section.                                     To facilitate the identification or location of property declared forfeited and to                           facilitate the disposition of petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture after the entry of                           an order declaring property forfeited to the state, the court may, upon application of the                              prosecuting attorney, order that the testimony of any witness relating to the forfeited property                           be taken by deposition, and that any book, paper, document, record, recording, or other                           material shall be produced as provided for depositions and discovery under the Utah Rules of                           Civil Procedure.                                      a   i   Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the                           prosecuting attorney shall publish notice of the order s intent to dispose of the property by                           electronic publication on Utah s Public Legal Notice Website established in Subsection                                              b .                                 ii   The prosecuting attorney shall also send written notice to any claimants, other than                           the defendant, known to the prosecuting attorney to have an interest in the property, at the                           claimant s last known address.                                 b   i   Any claimant, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property that                           has been ordered forfeited to the state under this section may, within    days after the notice                           has been published or the claimant receives the written notice under Subsection      a ,                           whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of the claimant s                           alleged interest in the property.                                 ii   Any genuine issue of material fact, including issues of standing, may be tried to a                           jury upon demand of any party.                                 c   The petition shall                                  i   be in writing and signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury                                  ii   set forth the nature and extent of the claimant s right, title, or interest in the                           property, the time and circumstances of the claimant s acquisition of the right, title, or interest                           in the property  and                                 iii   set forth any additional facts supporting the claimant s claim and the relief sought.                                 d   The trial or hearing on the petition shall be expedited to the extent practicable.  The                           court may consolidate a trial or hearing on the petition and any petition filed by any claimant                           other than the defendant under this section.  The court shall permit the parties to conduct                           pretrial discovery pursuant to the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.                                 e   i   At the trial or hearing, the claimant may testify and present evidence and                           witnesses on the claimant s own behalf and cross examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.                            The prosecuting attorney may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of the                              claim to the property and cross examine witnesses who appear.                                 ii   In addition to testimony and evidence presented at the trial or hearing, the court                           may consider the relevant portion of the record of the criminal case that resulted in the order of                           forfeiture.                                 iii   Any trial or hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the Utah Rules of Evidence.                                 f   The court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination, if                           after the trial or hearing, the court or jury determines that the petitioner has established by a                           preponderance of the evidence that                                  i   the claimant has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and the right, title, or                           interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or                           interest was vested in the claimant rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title,                           or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts or conduct that gave rise                           to the forfeiture of the property under this section  or                                 ii   the claimant acquired the right, title, or interest in the property in a bona fide                           transaction for value, and, at the time of acquisition, the claimant did not know that the                           property was subject to forfeiture.                                 g   Following the court s disposition of all petitions filed under this Subsection     , or                           if no petitions are filed following the expiration of the period provided in Subsection      b                            for the filing of petitions, the state has clear title to property subject to the order of forfeiture                           and may warrant good title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee.                                Section   .    Section                 is enacted to read                                         .  Trial by jury.                                The right to trial by jury applies to forfeiture proceedings under this chapter.                                Section   .    Section                 is enacted to read                                         .  Innocent owners.                                     An innocent owner s interest in property may not be forfeited.                                     In a forfeiture proceeding under this chapter, the prosecuting attorney has the                           burden of establishing evidence that a claimant                                  a   is responsible for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, subject to Subsection                                      b   knew of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, and allowed the property to be                           used in furtherance of the conduct                                     c   acquired the property with notice of its actual or constructive seizure for forfeiture                           under this chapter                                  d   acquired the property knowing the property was subject to forfeiture under this                           chapter  or                                 e   acquired the property in an effort to conceal, prevent, hinder, or delay its lawful                           seizure or forfeiture under any provision of state law.                                     a   A claimant under this chapter is not required to take steps to prevent illegal use                           or criminal activity regarding the property that the claimant reasonably believes would be likely                           to result in physical harm or danger to any person.                                 b   A claimant may demonstrate that the claimant took reasonable action to prohibit the                           illegal use of the property by                                  i   making a timely notification to a law enforcement agency of information that led the                           claimant to know that conduct subjecting the property to seizure would occur, was occurring,                           or has occurred                                  ii   timely revoking or attempting to revoke permission to use the property regarding                           those engaging in the illegal conduct  or                                 iii   taking reasonable actions to discourage or prevent the illegal use of the property.                                     If the state relies on Subsection     a  to establish that a claimant is not an innocent                           owner, and if the claimant is criminally charged with the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture                           and is acquitted of that charge on the merits                                  a   the property subject to the forfeiture or the open market value of the property, if the                           property has been disposed of under Subsection                     , shall be returned to the                           claimant  and                                 b   any payments required under this chapter regarding holding the property shall be                           paid to the claimant.                                     A person may not assert under this chapter an ownership interest in contraband.                                     Property is presumed to be subject to forfeiture under this chapter if the prosecuting                           attorney establishes that                                  a   the claimant has engaged in conduct giving cause for forfeiture                                  b   the property was acquired by the claimant during that period of the conduct giving                           cause for forfeiture or within a reasonable time after that period  and                                    c   there was no likely source for the purchase or acquisition of the property other than                           the conduct giving cause for forfeiture.                                     A finding that property is the proceeds of conduct giving cause for forfeiture does                           not require proof that the property was the proceeds of any particular exchange or transaction.                                Section   .    Section                 is enacted to read                                         .  Release of property held for forfeiture on certain grounds.                                     After the seizing agency gives notice that the property is to be held for forfeiture, a                           person or entity may not alienate, convey, sequester, or attach that property until the court                           issues a final order of dismissal or an order of forfeiture regarding the property.                                     The seizing agency or the prosecuting attorney may authorize the release of                           property held for forfeiture to a claimant if retention of actual custody is unnecessary.                                     With the consent of a court of competent jurisdiction, the prosecuting attorney may                           discontinue forfeiture proceedings and transfer the action to another state or federal agency that                           has initiated forfeiture proceedings involving the same property.                                     Property held for forfeiture is considered to be in the custody of the district court                           and subject only to                                  a   the orders and decrees of the court having jurisdiction over the property or the                           forfeiture proceedings  and                                 b   the acts of the agency that possesses the property or the prosecuting attorney                           pursuant to this chapter.                                     a   A claimant may obtain release of property held for forfeiture by posting with the                           district court a surety bond or cash in an amount equal to the current fair market value of the                           property as determined by the court or by the parties  stipulation.                                 b   The district court may refuse to order the release of the property if                                  i   the bond tendered is inadequate                                  ii   the property is contraband or is retained as evidence  or                                 iii   the property is particularly altered or designed for use in conduct giving cause for                           forfeiture.                                 c   If a surety bond or cash is posted and the court later determines that the property is                           subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the forfeiture of the surety bond or cash in lieu of the                           property.                                        A claimant is entitled to the immediate release of property held for forfeiture                           pending the final determination of forfeiture if                                  a   the claimant had a possessory interest in the property at the time of seizure                                  b   continued possession by the agency or the state pending the final disposition of the                           forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as                                  i   preventing the functioning of a legitimate business                                  ii   preventing any individual from working                                  iii   preventing any child from attending elementary or secondary school                                  iv   preventing or hindering any person from receiving necessary medical care                                  v   hindering the care of an elderly or disabled dependent child or adult                                  vi   leaving any individual homeless  or                                 vii   any other condition that the court determines causes a substantial hardship                                  c   the hardship from the continued possession of the property by the agency outweighs                           the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is                           returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding  and                                 d   determination of substantial hardship under this Subsection     is based upon the                           property s use prior to the seizure.                                     After the seizing agency gives notice that the property is to be held for forfeiture, a                           claimant may file a motion for hardship release                                  a   in the court in which forfeiture proceedings have commenced  or                                 b   in any district court having jurisdiction over the property, if forfeiture proceedings                           have not yet commenced.                                     The motion for hardship release shall also be served upon the prosecuting attorney                           or the seizing agency within    days after filing the motion.                                     The court shall render a decision on a motion for hardship filed under this section                           not later than    days after the date of filing, or    days after service upon the prosecuting                           attorney or seizing agency, whichever is earlier, unless this period is extended by the agreement                           of both parties or by the court for good cause shown.                                      a   If the claimant demonstrates substantial hardship pursuant to this section, the                           court shall order the property immediately released to the claimant pending completion of                           proceedings by the government to obtain forfeiture of the property.                                    b   The court may place conditions on release of the property as it finds necessary and                           appropriate to preserve the availability of the property or its equivalent for forfeiture.
