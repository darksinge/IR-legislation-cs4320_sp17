A licensee under this chapter whose license is suspended, revoked, or lapsed, but who          continues to act as a licensee, is subject to the penalties for acting as a licensee without a license.                   a   In any circumstances that would justify a suspension under Subsection    , the          commissioner may put the licensee on probation for a specified period no longer than    months.                b   The probation order shall state the conditions for retention of the license which shall          be reasonable.               c   Any violation of the probation is grounds for revocation pursuant to a proceeding          authorized under Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative Procedures Act.                   Any person licensed in this state shall immediately report to the commissioner                a   a suspension or revocation of that person s license in any other state, District of          Columbia, or territory of the United States                b   the imposition of a disciplinary sanction imposed on that person by any other state,          District of Columbia, or territory of the United States  and               c   a judgment or injunction entered against that person on the basis of conduct involving          fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or violation of a bail bond surety law or rule.

Subsequent motions to modify bail orders may be made only upon a showing that there          has been a material change in circumstances.
