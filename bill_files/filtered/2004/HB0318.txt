of                 PM   Utah Constitution Article XIII  Section    Subsection     provides that the Legislature may  exempt from property tax by statute   t angible personal property required by law to be  registered with the State before it is used on a public highway or waterway  on public land  or  in the air     This constitutional provision further requires that   i f the Legislature exempts   this  tangible personal property from property tax       it shall provide for the payment of  uniform statewide fees or uniform statewide rates of assessment or taxation on that property in  lieu of the property tax   This bill establishes multiple classes of tangible personal property and  subjects each class to a different fee schedule  Utah courts have not yet ruled on the issue of  whether the uniformity requirement of Utah Constitution Article XIII  Section    Subsection      permits the classification of tangible personal property and the imposition of different fees on  the basis of those classes  A limited legal review of this issue suggests that it is unclear whether  a court would find that the classifications and accompanying fee schedules provided for in this  bill meet the constitutional uniformity requirement    Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel  Bill Documents  Bills Directory           Who represents me       Remember my Legislators      State Senate
