Section      A  a         is amended to read                                    A  a       Rights of parents    Children s rights    Interest and responsibility of                            state                                      a   i  Courts have recognized a general presumption that it is in the best interest and                            welfare of a child to be raised under the care and supervision of  his  the child s natural parents                              A child s need for a normal family life in a permanent home  and for positive  nurturing family                            relationships will usually best be met by  his  the child s natural parents                                  ii   Additionally  the integrity of the family unit  and the right of parents to conceive                            and raise their children have found protection in the due process clause of the Fourteenth                            Amendment to the United States Constitution                                  iii   The right of a fit  competent parent to raise  his  the parent s child has long been                            protected by the laws and Constitution of this state and of the United States                                  b   It is the public policy of this state that parents retain the fundamental right and duty                            to exercise primary control over the care  custody  control  supervision  upbringing  and                            education of their children who are in their custody                                      a   It is also the public policy of this state that children have the right to protection                            from abuse and neglect  and that the state retains a compelling interest in investigating                             prosecuting  and punishing abuse and neglect  as defined in this chapter  and in Title                                Chapter  a  Juvenile Court Act of                                       b   Therefore  as a counterweight to parental rights  the state  as parens patriae  has an                            interest in and responsibility to protect children whose parents abuse them or do not adequately                            provide for their welfare   There are circumstances where a parent s conduct or condition is a                            substantial departure from the norm and the parent is unable or unwilling to render safe and                            proper parental care and protection   Under those circumstances  the welfare and protection of                            children is the consideration of paramount importance                                      When the division intervenes on behalf of an abused  neglected  or dependent child                             it shall take into account the child s need for protection from immediate harm   Throughout its                            involvement  the division shall utilize the least intrusive means available to protect a child  in                            an effort to ensure that children are brought up in stable  permanent families  rather than in                            temporary foster placements under the supervision of the state                                         When circumstances within the family pose a threat to the child s safety or welfare                             the state s

responsibilities shall be identified on the record  for the purpose of assisting                             in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts  in accordance with                             state and federal law                                   iii   A   The time period for reunification services may not exceed    months from the                             date that the child was initially removed from the child s home                                   B   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire                                months of reunification services                                   iv   If reunification services have been ordered  the court may terminate those services                             at any time                                   v   If  at any time  continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a child is determined to                             be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the child established pursuant to Subsection                                  a          then measures shall be taken  in a timely manner  to place the child in accordance                             with the permanency plan  and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the                             permanent placement of the child                                   d   Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period                             described in Subsection     c  does not interrupt the running of the period                                   e   i   If reunification services have been ordered  a permanency hearing shall be                             conducted by the court in accordance with Section         a         at the expiration of the time                             period for reunification services   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than                                months after the original removal of the child                                   ii   If reunification services have not been ordered  a permanency hearing shall be                             conducted within    days  in accordance with Section         a                                           f   With regard to a child who is    months of age or younger at the time the child is                             initially removed from the home  the court shall                                   i   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal                                 pursuant to Section         a          and                                  ii   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                             removal of the child from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts to                             comply with the treatment plan                                   g   With regard to a child in the custody of the division whose parent or parents have                             been ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that child for a period                             of six months since the date that reunification services were ordered  the court shall terminate                             reunification services  and the division shall petition the court for termination of parental                             rights                                        a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                            permanency for children who are abused  neglected  or dependent  the Legislature finds that a                            parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited   The court may determine that                            efforts to reunify a child with the child s family are not reasonable or appropriate  based on the                            individual circumstances  and that reunification services should not be provided   In                            determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a child  and in making  reasonable                            efforts   the child s health  safety  and welfare shall be the paramount concern                                     b        a   There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided                             to a parent if the court finds   by clear and convincing  evidence    that establishes beyond a                            reasonable doubt that any of the following circumstances exist                                   i   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown  based upon a verified affidavit                             indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent                                   ii   the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders  him                             the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services   that finding shall be based on                            competent evidence from mental health professionals establishing that  even with the provision                            of services  the parent is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within                               months                                    iii   A   the minor has been previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical                             or sexual abuse   that                                    B   following the adjudication the child was removed from the custody of  his  the                            child s parent    and was subsequently returned to the custody of that parent     and                                  C   the minor is being removed due to additional physical or sexual abuse                                      iv   the parent has caused the death of another child through abuse or neglect or has                             committed  aided  abetted  attempted  conspired  or solicited to commit murder or                             manslaughter of a child or child abuse homicide                                   v   the minor has suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the                             parent  if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the                             minor                                   vi   A   the minor has been adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by                             the parent     and                                  B   the court finds that it would not benefit the child to pursue reunification services                             with the offending parent                                   vii   the parent s rights have been terminated with regard to any other child                                   viii   A   the child has been removed from  his  the child s home on at least two                             previous occasions  and                                  B   reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times   or                                   ix   the parent has abandoned the child for a period of six months or longer  or                                  x   any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification                             efforts or services                                   b   For purposes of Subsection     a  ii   the court s finding that a parent is suffering                            from a mental illness of such magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing                            reunification services shall be based on competent evidence from mental health professionals                            establishing that  even with the provision of services  the parent is unlikely to be capable of                            adequately caring for the child within    months                                       a   The following shall be considered in determining whether reunification services                            are appropriate                                        a   Failure   i   failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with                             any previous treatment plan                                      ii   the fact that the child was abused while the parent was under the influence of drugs                             or alcohol                                      iii   a past history of violent behavior                                      iv   whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the child                                      v   any patterns of the parent s behavior that have exposed the child to repeated abuse                                 or   and                                  vi   testimony by a competent professional that the parent s behavior is unlikely to be                             successful   shall be considered in determining whether reunification services are appropriate                                    b   The court shall also consider whether the parent has expressed an interest in                             reunification with the child  in determining whether reunification services are appropriate                                       If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsection     a   and the                             whereabouts of a parent become known within six months of the out of home placement of the                             minor  the court may order the division to provide reunification services   The time limits                             described in Subsection      however  are not tolled by the parent s absence                                       a   If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized  the court shall order reasonable                             services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor   In                             determining detriment  the court shall consider the age of the child  the degree of parent child                             bonding  the length of the sentence  the nature of the treatment  the nature of the crime or

implementation of family reunification services                              and any other appropriate factors                                    b   Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the    month                             limitation imposed in Subsection                                       c   Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the    month                             limitation imposed in Subsection      unless the court determines that continued reunification                             services would be in the child s best interest                                       If  pursuant to Subsection      b  ii    iii    iv    v    vi    vii    viii    ix   or  x                                  a   the court does not
