present and flowing at all times                                  ii   it is clearly demonstrated that the required water related value is considered                           outstandingly remarkable within a region of comparison consisting of one of the three                           physiographic provinces in the state  and that the rationale and justification for the conclusions                           are disclosed                                  iii   the effects of the addition upon the local and state economies  agricultural and                           industrial operations and

         from the proposed river segment have been evaluated in detail by the relevant federal agency                                  iv   it is clearly demonstrated that the provisions and terms of the process for review of                           potential additions have been applied in a consistent manner by all federal agencies  and                                 v   the rationale and justification for the proposed addition  including a comparison                           with protections offered by other management tools  is clearly analyzed within the multiple use

management plans will be                           withheld until                                 i   it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area contains historic  cultural or scenic                           values  fish or wildlife resources  or natural processes which are unique or substantially                           significant on a regional basis  or contain natural hazards which

             federal agency for impacts resulting from potential actions which are consistent with the                           multiple use  sustained yield principles  and that this analysis describes the rationale for any                           special management attention required to protect  or prevent irreparable damage to the values                            resources  processes or hazards                                  iii   the difference between special management attention required for an ACEC and                           normal multiple use management has been identified and justified  and that any determination                           of irreparable damage has been analyzed and justified for short and long term horizons

conclusions of all studies are submitted to the state for review  and the results                            in support of or in opposition to  are included in all planning documents

the fiduciary obligations of both the                           state and federal governments toward trust lands management  and which assures that revenue                           authorized by federal statute to the state from mineral or timber production  present or future  is                           not diminished in any manner during valuation  negotiation  or implementation processes
