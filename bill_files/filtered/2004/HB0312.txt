to recover health care costs to the state imposed by nonparticipating manufacturers                                 b   to prevent nonparticipating manufacturers from undermining the state s policy of                          reducing underage smoking by offering cigarettes for sale substantially below the prices of                          cigarettes of other manufacturers
