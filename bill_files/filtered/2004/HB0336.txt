Subsection     may recover an amount                          not to exceed the amount of the guarantee upon a showing that                                 a   the claimant did not prevail on the real property claim  and                                b   the person seeking the guarantee suffered damages as a result of the maintenance of                          the notice                                     A court shall award costs and attorney fees to a prevailing party on any motion                          under this section unless the court finds that                                    a   the nonprevailing party acted with substantial justification  or                                b   other circumstances make the imposition of attorney fees and costs unjust       Legislative Review
