This bill allocates certain state sales and use tax revenues to counties  cities  and towns to  prevent revenue losses to those counties  cities  and towns   The revenue losses are as a result  of changes in the amount of local sales and use taxes a seller may retain if that seller is required  to remit sales and use taxes to the state on a monthly basis  The bill does not provide the  purposes for which the counties  cities  and towns may use the allocated revenues  Utah  Constitution Article XIII  Section    Utah s  vertical revenue sharing  provision   provides that   the Legislature may not impose a tax for the purpose of a political subdivision of the State  but  may by statute authorize political subdivisions of the State to assess and collect taxes for their  own purposes    There is no Utah case holding that this constitutional provision prohibits the  Legislature from allocating state revenues to local governments  However  there is some  authority indicating that such an allocation may constitute impermissible vertical revenue  sharing if the revenues are used for a purely local purpose  A court could find that this  allocation to counties  cities  and towns constitutes impermissible vertical revenue sharing if  the court determines that because the bill does not provide the purposes for which the allocated  revenues may be expended  those revenues may be expended for purely local purposes   However  a court could uphold the constitutionality of the allocation as having a state purpose  by finding that the state has an interest in simplifying state and local sales and use taxes and  this allocation prevents a resulting revenue loss to local governments    Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel  Bill Documents  Bills Directory
