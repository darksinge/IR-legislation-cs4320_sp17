As used in this section                                 a    Disposition or appointment of property  includes a transfer of an item of property                           or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument.                                b    Disqualifying homicide  means a homicide established by a preponderance of the                          evidence that meets the elements of any felony homicide offense in Title   , Chapter  ,                          Offenses Against the Person, except automobile homicide, applying the same principles of                          culpability and defenses as in Title   , including but not limited to Chapter  , Principles of                          Criminal Responsibility.                                 b    c    Governing instrument  means a governing instrument executed by the                           decedent.                                d    Killer  means a person who commits a disqualifying homicide.                                 c    e    Revocable,  with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision, or                           nomination, means one under which the decedent, at the time of or immediately before death,                           was alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the designation, in                           favor of the killer, whether or not the decedent was then empowered to designate himself in                           place of his killer and whether or not the decedent then had capacity to exercise the power.                                    An individual who  feloniously and intentionally kills  commits a disqualifying                          homicide of the decedent forfeits all benefits under this chapter with respect to the decedent s                           estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse s or child s share, a                           homestead allowance, exempt property, and a family allowance.  If the decedent died intestate,                           the decedent s intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed his intestate share.                                    The  felonious and intentional  killing of the decedent by means of a disqualifying                          homicide                                 a   revokes any revocable                                 i   disposition or appointment of property made by the decedent to the killer in a                           governing instrument                                 ii   provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of                           appointment on the killer  and                                   iii   nomination of the killer in a governing instrument, nominating or appointing the                           killer to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative,                           executor, trustee, or agent   and                                b   severs the interests of the decedent and killer in property held by them at the time of                           the killing as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests of the                           decedent and killer into tenancies in common.                                    A severance under Subsection     b  does not affect any third party interest in                           property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the                           killer unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded in                           records appropriate to the kind and location of the property which are relied upon, in the                           ordinary course of transactions involving such property, as evidence of ownership.                                    Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the killer disclaimed all                           provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or                           representative capacity, as if the killer predeceased the decedent.                                    A wrongful acquisition of property or interest by  a killer  one who kills another                          under circumstances not covered by this section shall be treated in accordance with the                           principle that  a killer  one who kills cannot profit from his wrong.                                     After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing                          criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively                          establishes the convicted individual as the decedent s killer for purposes of this section.  In the                          absence of a conviction, the  The court, upon the petition of an interested person, shall                           determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual  would be                          found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing  has committed a                          disqualifying homicide of the decedent.  If the court determines that, under that standard, the                           individual  would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing  has                          committed a disqualifying homicide of the decedent, the determination conclusively establishes                           that individual as  the decedent s killer  having committed a disqualifying homicide for                          purposes of this section.  A judgment of criminal conviction for a disqualifying homicide of the                          decedent, after all direct appeals have been exhausted, conclusively establishes that the                          convicted individual has committed the disqualifying homicide for purposes of this section.                                    a   A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or                              transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing                           instrument affected by  an intentional and felonious killing  a disqualifying homicide, or for                           having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument,                           upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent s death, before the payor or other third party                           received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.  A payor or                           other third party is liable for a payment made or other action taken after the payor or other third                           party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.                                b   Written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under Subsection     a  shall be                           mailed to the payor s or other third party s main office or home by registered or certified mail,                           return receipt requested, or served upon the payor or other third party in the same manner as a                            summons in a civil action.

The court shall hold the funds or item of                            property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance                            with the determination.  Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge                            the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of                            property transferred to or deposited with the court.                                     a   A person who purchases property for value and without notice, or who receives                            a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable                            obligation, is neither obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property, or                            benefit nor is liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of                            property or benefit.  But a person who, not for value, receives a payment, item of property, or                            any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the                            payment, item of property, or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or                            the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.                                 b   If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to                            a payment, an item of property, or any other benefit covered by this section, a person who, not                            for value, receives the payment, item of property, or any other benefit to which the person is                               not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property, or benefit, or                            is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or                            benefit, to the person who would have been entitled to it were this section or part of this section                            not preempted.
