tax an amount in excess of                                the lawful state and local percentage of total taxable sales allowed under this chapter, the seller                             shall remit to the commission the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter, plus any                             excess.                                  g   If the accounting methods regularly employed by the seller in the transaction of the                             seller s business are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month or quarterly period                             will impose unnecessary hardships, the commission may accept reports at intervals that will, in                             the commission s opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer or seller and will not                             jeopardize collection of the tax.                                            a   Except as provided in Subsections           through           and Section

calendar quarterly period, file with the commission a return for the preceding quarterly period.                                  ii   The seller shall remit with the return under Subsection

provided in Subsection           c , a return shall contain information and                             be in a form the commission prescribes by rule.                                  d   The sales tax as computed in the return shall be based upon the total nonexempt                             sales made during the period, including both cash and charge sales.                                  e

including                             both by cash and by charge.                                  f   i   Subject to Subsection           f  ii  and in accordance with Title   G, Chapter

Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM   As required by legislative rules and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General  Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its  own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill.  The note is based on an analysis of  relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill.  The note is not written for  the purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide  information relevant to legislators  consideration of this bill.  The note is not a substitute for the  judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a law in the  context of a specific case.    This bill expands sales and use tax payment, collection, and remittance obligations to include     out of state sellers who have a certain ownership or other relationship with an in state seller.   These relationships include an out of state seller who has a substantial ownership interest in an  in state business, or a seller who makes sales to in state purchasers by mail, telephone, the  Internet, or other media, and has a contractual relationship with an in state seller to perform  installation, maintenance, or repair services for those in state purchasers.    Because this bill imposes obligations on out of state sellers, the bill raises issues under the  Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  The Constitution of the Unites States  grants Congress the authority to  regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the  several States.   U.S. Const. art. I,    .  Case law has interpreted the Commerce Clause as  having a dormant aspect, which  prohibits certain state actions that interfere with interstate  commerce.   Quill Corp. v. North Dakota By and Through Heitkamp,     U.S.    ,              quoting South Caroling State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc.,     U.S.    ,             .    In evaluating a state statute under a dormant Commerce Clause challenge, the Supreme Court  of the United States has held that a state may not require an out of state seller to collect and  remit a use tax unless the seller has  substantial nexus  with the taxing state.  Quill,     U.S. at     .  The Court has found that  a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail  or common carrier lacks the  substantial nexus  required by the Commerce Clause.   The Quill  case thus established a bright line rule that some physical presence is required in a state before  the state may impose sales and use tax collection obligations on a seller.  Quill,     U.S. at         w hether or not a State may compel a vendor to collect a sales or use tax may turn on the  presence in the taxing State of a small sales force, plant, or office.    In Scripto v. Carson, the  Supreme Court of the United States found that independent contractors soliciting business  within a state was sufficient presence for the state to impose use tax collection duties.  Scripto  v. Carson,     U.S.    ,           .        This bill raises the issue of the application of the Quill case and its  substantial nexus  standard  to an area of rapidly changing, evolving technology.  Cases are currently moving through the  courts that provide the courts with an opportunity to more clearly define and articulate the legal  contours of what constitutes  substantial nexus  with a taxing state.  It is impossible to predict  the outcome of these cases and what changes, if any, they might have on the standards set forth  in Quill.  In addition, the Court in Quill noted that this issue is  one that Congress may be  better qualified to resolve  and also  has the ultimate power to resolve.   Quill,     U.S. at     . Thus, it is also possible that Congress may act on this interstate commerce issue.          However, because current dormant Commerce Clause case law under Quill requires physical  presence to satisfy  substantial nexus,  there is a high probability that if challenged, a court  would hold that this bill, which establishes nexus on the basis of an ownership or other  relationship between an out of state seller and an in state seller, violates the dormant  Commerce Clause.
