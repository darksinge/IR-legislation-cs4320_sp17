Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  State agencies and local governments to adopt guidelines.                   Each state agency and local government shall adopt guidelines to assist them in the          identification of actions that have constitutional taking implications.                   In creating the guidelines, the state agency and local government shall take into          consideration recent court rulings on the taking of private property and apply the following          principles                a   state agencies and local governments shall be sensitive to, anticipate, and account for          the obligations imposed by takings law in planning and carrying out governmental actions                       b   governmental actions that are taken by state agencies and local governments and that         result in a physical invasion or occupancy of private property and actions that affect the value or         use of private property may constitute a taking of private property               c   governmental actions may amount to a taking even though               i   the action constitutes less than a complete deprivation of all use or value of the private         property               ii   the action constitutes less than a complete deprivation of all separate and distinct         interests in the same private property  or              iii   the action is only temporary in nature                d   although governmental actions taken specifically to protect the public health and safety          are given broader latitude by the courts before the actions are considered to be takings, and because          the mere assertion of a public health and safety purpose is insufficient to avoid a taking, state          agencies and local governments should ensure that governmental actions taken to protect the          public health and safety are                i   taken only in response to real and substantial threats to public health and safety                ii   designed to advance significantly the health and safety purpose  and               iii   no greater than necessary to achieve the health and safety purpose                e   although normal governmental processes do not ordinarily constitute takings, undue          delays in decision making that interfere with private property use may be held to be a taking and          may increase significantly the size of compensation due to a private property owner if a taking is          found to have occurred  and               f   the constitutional protections against taking private property are self executing and          require compensation regardless of whether underlying authority for the action intended a taking          or authorized the payment of compensation.                    The   a   Each state agency shall complete the guidelines on or before January  ,                     , and review and update the guidelines annually to maintain consistency with court          rulings.               b   Each local government shall complete the guidelines on or before January  ,     , and          review and update the guidelines annually to maintain consistency with court rulings.

Using the guidelines prepared under Section        , and in consultation with the         takings attorney hired under authority of Section        . , each state agency and local         government shall               a   determine whether an action has constitutional taking implications  and              b   if so, prepare an assessment of constitutional taking implications that includes an         analysis of the following               i   the likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking, including a         description of how the taking affects the use or value of private property               ii   alternatives to the proposed action that may                A   fulfill the government s legal obligations  of the state agency                 B   reduce the impact on the private property owner  and               C   reduce the risk of a constitutional taking  and               iii   an estimate of financial cost to the state or local government for compensation and the          source of payment within the  agency s  entity s budget if a constitutional taking is determined.                   In addition to the guidelines prepared under Section        , each state agency and          local government shall  adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to  comply with the following          criteria if implementing or enforcing actions that have constitutional taking implications                a   If  an  a state agency or local government requires a person to obtain a permit for a          specific use of private property, any conditions imposed on issuing the permit shall directly relate          to the purpose for which the permit is issued and shall substantially advance that purpose.               b   Any restriction imposed on the use of private property shall be proportionate to the          extent the use contributes to the overall problem that the restriction is to redress.               c   If an action involves a permitting process or any other decision making process that          will interfere with, or otherwise prohibit, the use of private property pending the completion of the          process, the duration of the process shall be kept to the minimum necessary.               d   Before taking an action restricting private property use for the protection of public          health or safety, the state agency or local government, in internal deliberative documents, shall                i   clearly identify, with as much specificity as possible, the public health or safety risk          created by the private property use                ii   establish that the action substantially advances the purpose of protecting public health          and safety against the specifically identified risk                       iii   establish, to the extent possible, that the restrictions imposed on the private property         are proportionate to the extent the use contributes to the overall risk  and              iv   estimate, to the extent possible, the potential cost to the government if a court         determines that the action constitutes a constitutional taking.                  If there is an immediate threat to health and safety that constitutes an emergency and         requires an immediate response, the analysis required by Paragraph     b  of this section may be         made when the response is completed.                  a   Before the state agency implements an action that has constitutional taking         implications, the state agency shall submit a copy of the assessment of constitutional taking          implications to the governor and the Legislative Management Committee.               b   Before a local government implements an action that has constitutional taking          implications, the local government shall submit a copy of the assessment of constitutional taking          implications to                i   the county executive and the county legislative body, if the local government is a          county or township  and               ii   the municipal executive and the municipal legislative body, as defined in   A      ,          if the local government is a municipality.
