The enforcing authority may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to              a    to  obtain a declaratory judgment that an act or practice violates this chapter              b    to  enjoin, in accordance with the principles of equity, a supplier who has violated,       is violating, or is otherwise likely to violate this chapter   and              c    to  recover, for each violation, actual damages, or obtain relief under Subsection           b , on behalf of consumers who complained to the enforcing authority within a reasonable       time after it instituted proceedings under this chapter .   and             d   obtain a fine in an amount determined after considering the factors in Subsection          .                 a   The enforcing authority may bring a class action on behalf of consumers for the       actual damages caused by an act or practice specified as violating this chapter in a rule adopted       by the enforcing authority under Subsection            before the consumer transactions on       which the action is based, or declared to violate Section         or         by final judgment       of courts of general jurisdiction and appellate courts of this state that was either reported       officially or made available for public dissemination under Subsection            c  by the       enforcing authority    days before the consumer transactions on which the action is based, or,       with respect to a supplier who agreed to it, was prohibited specifically by the terms of a consent        judgment that became final before the consumer transactions on which the action is based.              b   i   On motion of the enforcing authority and without bond in an action under this        Subsection    , the court may make appropriate orders, including appointment of a master or        receiver or sequestration of assets, but only if it appears that the defendant is threatening or is        about to remove, conceal, or dispose of the defendant s property to the damage of persons for        whom relief is requested.  An appropriate order may include an order to               A    to  reimburse consumers found to have been damaged               B    to  carry out a transaction in accordance with consumers  reasonable expectations               C    to  strike or limit the application of unconscionable clauses of contracts to avoid        an unconscionable result   or               D   impose a fine in an amount determined after considering the factors listed in        Subsection      or               D  to   E   grant other appropriate relief.              ii   The court may assess the expenses of a master or receiver against a supplier.              c   If an act or practice that violates this chapter unjustly enriches a supplier and        damages can be computed with reasonable certainty, damages recoverable on behalf of        consumers who cannot be located with due diligence shall be transferred to the state treasurer        pursuant to Title   , Chapter  a, Unclaimed Property Act.              d   If a supplier shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of this        chapter resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures        reasonably adapted to avoid the error, recovery under this Subsection     is limited to the        amount, if any, by which the supplier was unjustly enriched by the violation.              e   An action may not be brought by the enforcing authority under this Subsection            more than two years after the occurrence of a violation of this chapter.                  a   The enforcing authority may terminate an investigation or an action other than a        class action upon acceptance of the supplier s written assurance of voluntary compliance with        this chapter.  Acceptance of an assurance may be conditioned on a commitment to reimburse        consumers or take other appropriate corrective action.              b   An assurance is not evidence of a prior violation of this chapter.  Unless an        assurance has been rescinded by agreement of the parties or voided by a court for good cause,        subsequent failure to comply with the terms of an assurance is prima facie evidence of a        violation.                  a   In addition to other penalties and remedies set out under this chapter, and in        addition to its other enforcement powers under  Title   ,  Chapter  , Division of Consumer        Protection, the division director may issue a cease and desist order and impose an        administrative fine of up to   ,    for each violation of this chapter.              b   All money received through  administrative  fines imposed under this section shall        be deposited in the Consumer Protection Education and Training Fund created by Section              .                  a   Within    days after agency or judicial review of a final division order imposing        an administrative fine, the supplier on whom the fine is imposed shall pay the fine in full.              b   The unpaid amount of a fine is increased by                   i   if the fine has not been paid in full within    days after the final division order        imposing the fine  and              ii   unless the division waives the     increase in a stipulated payment plan.                  A fine imposed under Subsection     d  or Subsection     b  i  D  shall be        determined after considering the following factors               a   the seriousness, nature, circumstances, extent, and persistence of the conduct        constituting the violation               b   the harm to other persons resulting either directly or indirectly from the violation               c   cooperation by the supplier in an inquiry or investigation conducted by the        enforcing authority concerning the violation               d   efforts by the supplier to prevent occurrences of the violation               e   efforts by the supplier to mitigate the harm caused by the violation, including a        reimbursement made to a consumer injured by the act of the supplier               f   the history of previous violations by the supplier               g   the need to deter the supplier or other suppliers from committing the violation in        the future  and              h   other matters as justice may require.
