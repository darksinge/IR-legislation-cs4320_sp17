WATER FORFEITURE AMENDMENTS                                 GENERAL SESSION                          STATE OF UTAH                             Sponsor   Michael R. Styler                             This act modifies the Water and Irrigation Code to amend provisions relating to the                          abandonment and forfeiture of water.                          This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows                           AMENDS                                     , as last amended by Chapter    , Laws of Utah                               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                Section  .    Section               is amended to read                                       .  Reversion to the public by abandonment or forfeiture for nonuse within five                           years    Extension of time.                                    In order to further the state policy of securing the maximum use and benefit of its                          scarce water resources, a person entitled to the use of water has always had a continuing obligation                          to place all of a water right to beneficial use.  The forfeiture of all or part of any right to use water                          for failure to place all or part of the water to beneficial use makes possible the allocation and use                          of water consistent with long established beneficial use concepts.  The provisions of Subsections                              through     shall be construed to carry out the purposes and policies set forth in this Subsection                             .                                    As used in this section,  public water supply entity  means an entity that supplies water                          as a utility service or for irrigation purposes and is also                                 a   a municipality, water conservancy district, metropolitan water district, irrigation district                          created under Section       A        , or other public agency                                 b   a water company regulated by the Public Service Commission  or                                c   any other owner of a community water system.                                          a   When an appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest abandons or                              ceases to use all or a portion of a water right for a period of five years, the water right or the unused                          portion of that water right ceases and the water reverts to the public, unless, before the expiration                           of the five year period, the appropriator or the appropriator s successor in interest files a verified                          nonuse application  for an extension of time  with the state engineer.                                b   i   A nonuse application may be filed on all or a portion of the water right, including                          water rights held by mutual irrigation companies.                                ii   Public water supply entities that own stock in a mutual water company, after giving                          written notice to the water company, may file nonuse applications with the state engineer on the                          water represented by the stock.                                 b    c   i   A water right or a portion of the water right may not be forfeited unless a                           judicial action to declare the right forfeited is commenced within    years from the end of the                           latest period of nonuse of at least five years.                                ii   If forfeiture is asserted in an action for general determination of rights in conformance                           with the provisions of Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights, the    year limitation period                           shall commence to run back in time from the date the state engineer s proposed determination of                           rights is served upon each claimant.                                iii   A decree entered in an action for general determination of rights under Chapter  ,                          Determination of Water Rights, shall bar any claim of forfeiture for prior nonuse against any right                           determined to be valid in the decree, but shall not bar a claim for periods of nonuse that occur after                          the entry of the decree.                                iv   A proposed determination by the state engineer in an action for general determination                          of rights under Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights, shall bar any claim of forfeiture for prior                          nonuse against any right proposed to be valid, unless a timely objection has been filed within the                          time allowed in Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights.                                 c    d   The extension of time to resume the use of that water may not exceed five years                           unless the time is further extended by the state engineer.                                 d    e   The provisions of this section are applicable whether the unused or abandoned                           water or a portion of the water is permitted to run to waste or is used by others without right with                          the knowledge of the water right holder, provided that the use of water pursuant to a lease or other                          agreement with the appropriator or the appropriator s successor shall be considered to constitute                          beneficial use.                                   f   The provisions of this section shall not apply                                 i   to those periods of time when a surface water source fails to yield sufficient water to                          satisfy the water right, or when groundwater is not available because of a sustained drought                                 ii   to water stored in reservoirs pursuant to an existing water right, where the stored water                          is being held in storage for present or future use  or                                iii   when a water user has beneficially used substantially all of a water right within a                          five year period, provided that this exemption shall not apply to the adjudication of a water right                          in a general determination of water rights under Chapter  , Determination of Water Rights.                                g   Groundwater rights used to supplement the quantity or quality of other water supplies                          may not be subject to loss or reduction under this section if not used during periods when the other                          water source delivers sufficient water so as to not require use of the supplemental groundwater.                                          a   The state engineer shall furnish an application  form that includes a space for                           requiring the following information                                 i   the name and address of the applicant
