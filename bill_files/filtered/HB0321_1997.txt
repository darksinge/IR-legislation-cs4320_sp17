The  Department of Workforce Services  Labor Commission has authority to establish          rules necessary for the purposes of Sections     a    through     a   .                   The presumption provided by Sections     a    through     a    is a rebuttable          presumption.              Section   .  Section    A         Effective           is amended to read                  A         Effective          .  Surplus lines insurance    Unauthorized insurers.                   Notwithstanding Section   A       , a foreign insurer that has not obtained a          certificate of authority to do business in this state under Section   A        may negotiate for and          make insurance contracts with persons in this state and on risks located in this state, subject to the          limitations and requirements of this section.                   For contracts made under this section, the insurer may, in this state, inspect the risks          to be insured, collect premiums and adjust losses, and do all other acts reasonably incidental to the          contract, through employees or through independent contractors.                   Subsections     and     do not permit any person to solicit business in this state on          behalf of an insurer that has no certificate of authority.  Any insurance placed with a nonadmitted          insurer shall be placed with a surplus lines broker licensed under Chapter   .  The commissioner          may by rule prescribe how a surplus lines broker may pay or permit the payment, commission, or          other remuneration on insurance placed by him under authority of his license to one holding a          license to act as an insurance agent, and how he may advertise the availability of his services in          procuring, on behalf of persons seeking insurance, contracts with nonadmitted insurers.                   For contracts made under this section, nonadmitted insurers are subject to Sections            A        and   A        and the rules adopted under those sections.                   A nonadmitted insurer may not issue workers  compensation insurance coverage to                  employers located in this state, except for stop loss coverages issued to employers securing         workers  compensation under Subsection    A          A          c .                  a   The commissioner may by rule prohibit making contracts under Subsection     for         a specified class of insurance if authorized insurers provide an established market for the class in         this state that is adequate and reasonably competitive.              b   The commissioner may by rule place restrictions and limitations on and create special         procedures for making contracts under Subsection     for a specified class of insurance if there         have been abuses of placements in the class or if the policyholders in the class, because of limited         financial resources, business experience, or knowledge, cannot protect their own interests          adequately.               c   The commissioner may prohibit an individual insurer from making any contract under          Subsection     and all insurance agents and brokers from dealing with the insurer if                i   the insurer has willfully violated this section, Section   A      ,   A       , or            A       , or any rule adopted under any of these sections                ii   the insurer has failed to pay the fees and taxes specified under Section   A        or               iii   the commissioner has reason to believe that the insurer is in an unsound condition or          is operated in a fraudulent, dishonest, or incompetent manner or in violation of the law of its          domicile.               d   The commissioner may issue lists of unauthorized foreign insurers whose solidity he          doubts or whose practices he considers objectionable.  The commissioner shall issue lists of          unauthorized foreign insurers he considers to be reliable and solid.  The commissioner may also          issue other relevant evaluations of unauthorized insurers.  No action lies against the commissioner          or any employee of the department for any written or oral communication made in, or in          connection with the issuance of, these lists or evaluations.  A foreign unauthorized insurer shall          be listed on the commissioner s  reliable  list only if the unauthorized insurer                i   has delivered a request to the commissioner to be on the list                ii   has established satisfactory evidence of good reputation and financial integrity                iii   has delivered to the commissioner a copy of its current annual statement certified by          the insurer and continues each subsequent year to file its annual statements with the commissioner          within    days of its filing with the insurance regulatory authority where it is domiciled  and               iv   A   is in substantial compliance with the solvency standards in Chapter   , Part  ,                  Risk Based Capital, or maintains capital and surplus of at least   ,   ,   , whichever is greater,         and maintains in the United States an irrevocable trust fund in either a national bank or a member         of the Federal Reserve System, or maintains a deposit meeting the statutory deposit requirements         for insurers in the state where it is made, which trust fund or deposit               I   shall be in an amount not less than   ,   ,    for the protection of all of the insurer s         policyholders in the United States               II   may consist of cash, securities, or investments of substantially the same character and         quality as those which are  qualified assets  under Section   A         and              III   may include as part of the trust arrangement a letter of credit that qualifies as          acceptable security under Subsection   A           c  iii   or               B   in the case of any  Lloyd s  or other similar incorporated or unincorporated group of          alien individual insurers, maintains a trust fund that                I   shall be in an amount not less than    ,   ,    as security to its full amount for all          policyholders and creditors in the United States of each member of the group                II   may consist of cash, securities, or investments of substantially the same character and          quality as those which are  qualified assets  under Section   A         and               III   may include as part of this trust arrangement a letter of credit that qualifies as          acceptable security under Subsection   A           c  iii .                   A surplus lines broker may not, either knowingly or without reasonable investigation          of the financial condition and general reputation of the insurer, place insurance under this section          with financially unsound insurers or with insurers engaging in unfair practices, or with otherwise          substandard insurers, unless the broker gives the applicant notice in writing of the known          deficiencies of the insurer or the limitations on his investigation, and explains the need to place          the business with that insurer.  A copy of this notice shall be kept in the office of the broker for at          least five years.  To be financially sound, an insurer shall satisfy standards that are comparable to          those applied under the laws of this state to authorized insurers.  Insurers on the  doubtful or          objectionable  list under Subsection     d  and insurers not on the commissioner s  reliable  list          under Subsection     d  are presumed substandard.                   A policy issued under this section shall include a description of the subject of the          insurance and indicate the coverage, conditions, and term of the insurance, the premium charged          and premium taxes to be collected from the policyholder, and the name and address of the                  policyholder and insurer.  If the direct risk is assumed by more than one insurer, the policy shall         state the names and addresses of all insurers and the portion of the entire direct risk each has         assumed.  All policies issued under the authority of this section shall have attached or affixed to         the policy the following statement   The insurer issuing this policy does not hold a certificate of         authority to do business in this state and thus is not fully subject to regulation by the Utah         insurance commissioner.  This policy receives no protection from any of the guaranty associations         created under Title   A, Chapter   .                   Upon placing a new or renewal coverage under this section, the broker shall promptly         deliver to the policyholder or his agent evidence of the insurance consisting either of the policy          as issued by the insurer or, if the policy is not then available, a certificate, cover note, or other          confirmation of insurance complying with Subsection    .                    If he finds it necessary to protect the interests of insureds and the public in this state,          the commissioner may by rule subject policies issued under this section to as much of the          regulation provided by this title as is required for comparable policies written by authorized          foreign insurers.                    a   Each surplus lines transaction in this state shall be examined to determine whether          it complies with                i   the surplus lines tax levied under Chapter                  ii   the solicitation limitations of Subsection                    iii   the requirement of Subsection     that placement be through a surplus lines broker                iv   placement limitations imposed under Subsections     a ,  b , and  c   and               v   the policy form requirements of Subsections     and     .               b   The examination described in Subsection      a  shall take place as soon as practicable          after the transaction.  The surplus lines broker shall submit to the examiner information necessary          to conduct the examination within a period specified by rule.               c   The examination described in Subsection      a  may be conducted by the          commissioner or by an advisory organization created under Section   A        and authorized          by the commissioner to conduct these examinations.  The commissioner is not required to          authorize any additional advisory organizations to conduct examinations under this subsection.           The commissioner s authorization of one or more advisory organizations to act as examiners under          this subsection shall be by rule.  In addition, the authorization shall be evidenced by a contract, on                  a form provided by the commissioner, between the authorized advisory organization and the         department.              d   The person conducting the examination described in Subsection      a  shall collect         a stamping fee of an amount not to exceed    of the policy premium payable in connection with         the transaction.  Stamping fees collected by the commissioner shall be deposited in the General         Fund.  The commissioner shall establish this fee by rule.  Stamping fees collected by an advisory         organization are the property of the advisory organization to be used in paying the expenses of the         advisory organization.  Liability for paying the stamping fee is as required under Subsection           A          for taxes imposed under Section   A      .  The commissioner shall adopt a rule          dealing with the payment of stamping fees.  If stamping fees are not paid when due, the          commissioner or advisory organization may impose a penalty of     of the fee due, plus                 per month from the time of default until full payment of the fee.  Fees relative to policies covering          risks located partially in this state shall be allocated in the same manner as under Subsection            A         .               e   The commissioner, representatives of the department, advisory organizations,          representatives and members of advisory organizations, authorized insurers, and surplus lines          insurers are not liable for damages on account of statements, comments, or recommendations made          in good faith in connection with their duties under this subsection or under Section   A       .               f   Examinations conducted under this subsection and the documents and materials related          to the examinations are confidential.              Section   .  Section    A         Effective           is amended to read                  A         Effective          .  Motor vehicle liability coverage.                   In addition to complying with the requirements of Chapter    and Part II of Chapter            , a policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection   A           a  shall                a   name the motor vehicle owner or operator in whose name the policy was purchased,          state that named insured s address, the coverage afforded, the premium charged, the policy period,          and the limits of liability                b   i   if it is an owner s policy, designate by appropriate reference all the motor vehicles          on which coverage is granted, insure the person named in the policy, insure any other person using          any named motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured, and, except          as provided in Subsection    , insure any person included in Subsection     c  against loss from                  the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of these         motor vehicles within the United States and Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and         costs, for each motor vehicle, in amounts not less than the minimum limits specified under Section           A         or              ii   if it is an operator s policy, insure the person named as insured against loss from the         liability imposed upon him by law for damages arising out of the insured s use of any motor         vehicle not owned by him, within the same territorial limits and with the same limits of liability         as in an owner s policy under Subsection     b  i   and              c   except as provided in Subsection    , insure persons related to the named insured by          blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship who are residents of the named insured s household,          including those who usually make their home in the same household but temporarily live          elsewhere, to the same extent as the named insured.                   A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection            A           a  may                a   provide for the prorating of the insurance under that policy with other valid and          collectible insurance                b   grant any lawful coverage in addition to the required motor vehicle liability coverage                c   if the policy is issued to a person other than a motor vehicle business, limit the          coverage afforded to a motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum          limits under Section   A       , and to those instances when there is no other valid and          collectible insurance with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or          contingent  and               d   if issued to a motor vehicle business, restrict coverage afforded to anyone other than          the motor vehicle business or its officers, agents, or employees to the minimum limits under          Section   A       , and to those instances when there is no other valid and collectible insurance          with at least those limits, whether the other insurance is primary, excess, or contingent.                   Motor vehicle liability coverage need not insure any liability                a   under any workers  compensation law under Title    A    A                b   resulting from bodily injury to or death of an employee of the named insured, other          than a domestic employee, while engaged in the employment of the insured, or while engaged in          the operation, maintenance, or repair of a designated vehicle  or                       c   resulting from damage to property owned by, rented to, bailed to, or transported by the         insured.                  An insurance carrier providing motor vehicle liability coverage has the right to settle         any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of the         settlement is deductible from the limits of liability specified under Section   A       .                  A policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage imposes on the insurer the duty         to defend, in good faith, any person insured under the policy against any claim or suit seeking         damages which would be payable under the policy.                  a   If a policy containing motor vehicle liability coverage provides an insurer with the          defense of lack of cooperation on the part of the insured, that defense is not effective against a third          person making a claim against the insurer, unless there was collusion between the third person and          the insured.               b   If the defense of lack of cooperation is not effective against the claimant, after          payment, the insurer is subrogated to the injured person s claim against the insured to the extent          of the payment and is entitled to reimbursement by the insured after the injured third person has          been made whole with respect to the claim against the insured.                   A policy of motor vehicle liability coverage under Subsection   A           may          specifically exclude from coverage a person who is a resident of the named insured s household,          including a person who usually makes his home in the same household but temporarily lives          elsewhere, if each person excluded from coverage satisfies the owner s or operator s security          requirement of Section      a    , independently of the named insured s proof of owner s or          operator s security.              Section   .  Section    A         Effective           is amended to read                  A         Effective          .  Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.                   As used in this section,  covered persons  includes                a   the named insured                b   persons related to the named insured by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship,          who are residents of the named insured s household, including those who usually make their home          in the same household but temporarily live elsewhere                c   any person occupying or using a motor vehicle referred to in the policy or owned by          a self insurer  and                       d   any person who is entitled to recover damages against the owner or operator of the         uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury to or death of persons under         Subsection     a ,  b , or  c .                  As used in this section,  uninsured motor vehicle  includes               a   i   a vehicle, the operation, maintenance, or use of which is not covered under a         liability policy at the time of an injury causing occurrence  or              ii   A   a vehicle covered with lower liability limits than required by Section   A                      B   the vehicle described in Subsection     a  ii  A  is uninsured to the extent of the         deficiency                b   an unidentified vehicle that left the scene of an accident proximately caused by the          vehicle operator  or               c   i   an insured vehicle if, before or after the accident, the liability insurer of the vehicle          is declared insolvent by a court of competent jurisdiction                ii   the vehicle described in Subsection     c  i  is uninsured only to the extent that the          claim against the insolvent insurer is not paid by a guaranty association or fund.                   Uninsured motorist coverage under Subsection   A           b  provides coverage          for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of          uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death in limits that at least          equal the minimum bodily injury limits for motor vehicle liability policies under Section            A       .                   a   Except as provided in Subsection     b , the named insured may reject uninsured          motorist coverage by an express writing to the insurer that provides liability coverage under          Subsection   A           a .  This rejection continues for that issuer of the liability coverage          until the insured in writing requests uninsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.               b   All persons, including governmental entities, that are engaged in the business of, or          that accept payment for, transporting natural persons by motor vehicle, and all school districts that          provide transportation services for their students, shall provide coverage for all vehicles used for          that purpose, by purchase of a policy of insurance or by self insurance, uninsured motorist          coverage of at least    ,    per person and     ,    per accident.               i   This coverage is secondary to any other insurance covering an injured covered person.               ii   This coverage does not apply to an employee, who is injured by an uninsured motorist,                  whose exclusive remedy is provided by Title    A    A, Chapter      , Workers  Compensation         Act.              c   As used in this subsection               i    Governmental entity  has the same meaning as under Section        .              ii    Motor vehicle  has the same meaning as under Section     a    .                  When a covered person alleges that an uninsured motor vehicle under Subsection     b          proximately caused an accident without touching the covered person or the vehicle occupied by         the covered person, the covered person must show the existence of the uninsured motor vehicle         by clear and convincing evidence consisting of more than the covered person s testimony.                    a   The limit of liability for uninsured motorist coverage for two or more motor          vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance          coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.               b   i   Subsection  a  applies to all persons except a covered person as defined under          Subsection     b  ii .               ii   A covered person as defined under Subsection     b  ii  is entitled to the highest limits          of uninsured motorist coverage afforded for any one vehicle that the covered person is the named          insured or an insured family member.               iii   This coverage shall be in addition to the coverage on the vehicle the covered person          is occupying.               iv   Neither the primary nor the secondary coverage may be set off against the other.               c   Coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident shall be primary          coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections     a  and  b  shall          be secondary coverage.                   a   Uninsured motorist coverage under this section applies to bodily injury, sickness,          disease, or death of covered persons while occupying or using a motor vehicle only if the motor          vehicle is described in the policy under which a claim is made, or if the motor vehicle is a newly          acquired or replacement vehicle covered under the terms of the policy.  Except as provided in          Subsection     or    , a covered person injured in a vehicle described in a policy that includes          uninsured motorist benefits may not elect to collect uninsured motorist coverage benefits from any          other motor vehicle insurance policy under which he is a covered person.               b   Each of the following persons may also recover uninsured motorist benefits under any                  other policy in which they are described as a  covered person  as defined in Subsection                   i   a covered person injured as a pedestrian by an uninsured motor vehicle  and              ii   a covered person injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned         by, furnished, or available for the regular use of the covered person, the covered person s resident         spouse, or the covered person s resident relative.              c   A covered person in Subsection     b  is not barred against making subsequent         elections if recovery is unavailable under previous elections.                  a   As used in this section,  underinsured motor vehicle  includes a vehicle, the         operation, maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time of an          injury causing occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the          injured party for all special and general damages.               b   The term  underinsured motor vehicle  does not include                i   a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same policy that also          contains the underinsured motorist coverage  or               ii   an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection    .                   a   Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection   A           c  provides          coverage for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators          of underinsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death in limits of          at least    ,    for one person in any one accident, and at least    ,    for two or more persons          in any one accident.               b   The named insured s underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection     a ,          is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle,          as described in Subsection    .  Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the          liability coverage of the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added          to, combined with, or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the          underinsured motor vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.               c   i   For new policies or contracts written after January  ,     , a named insured may          reject underinsured motorist coverage by an express writing to the insurer that provides liability          coverage under Subsection   A           a .  This rejection continues for that issuer of the          liability coverage until the insured in writing requests underinsured motorist coverage from that          liability insurer.                       ii   In conjunction with the first three renewal notices sent after January  ,     , for         policies existing on that date, the insurer shall notify the insured of the availability of underinsured         motorist coverage along with estimated ranges of premiums for the coverage.  The department         shall provide standard language to be used by insurers to fulfill the insurers  duty under this         subsection.                   a   Underinsured motorist coverage under this section applies to bodily injury,         sickness, disease, or death of an insured while occupying or using a motor vehicle owned by,         furnished, or available for the regular use of the insured, a resident spouse, or resident relative of         the insured, only if the motor vehicle is described in the policy under which a claim is made, or          if the motor vehicle is a newly acquired or replacement vehicle covered under the terms of the          policy.  Except as provided in Subsection     , a covered person injured in a vehicle described in          a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not elect to collect underinsured motorist          coverage benefits from any other motor vehicle insurance policy under which he is a named          insured.               b   i   The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motor          vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance          coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.               ii   Subsection      b  i  applies  to  all  persons  except  a  covered person as defined          under Subsection      c  i  B .               iii   Coverage  on  a  motor  vehicle  occupied  at  the  time of an accident shall be primary          coverage, and the coverage elected by a  person described under Subsections     a  and  b  shall          be secondary coverage.               c   i   Each  of the following persons may also recover underinsured motorist coverage          benefits under any  other  policy  in  which  they  are described as a  covered person  as defined          under Subsection                    A   a  covered  person  injured  as  a pedestrian by an underinsured  motor vehicle  or               B   a covered person  injured  while  occupying  or  using  a  motor vehicle that is not          owned by, furnished, or available for the regular use of  the  covered  person,  the  covered           person s resident spouse, or the covered person s resident relative.               ii   This coverage shall only be available as a secondary source  of coverage.               iii   A covered person as defined under Subsection      c  i  B  is entitled to the highest                  limits of underinsured motorist coverage afforded for any one vehicle that the covered person is         the named insured or an insured family member.              iv   This coverage shall be in addition to the coverage on the vehicle the covered person         is occupying.              v   Neither the primary nor the secondary coverage may be set off against the other.              d   A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections if recovery         is unavailable under previous elections.

Any  fee chargeable to         the employer or carrier is to be a credit upon any fee payable by the injured employee or, in the         case of death, by the dependents, for any recovery had against the third party.              b   The person liable for compensation payments shall be reimbursed, less the          proportionate share of costs and attorneys  fees provided for in Subsection     a , for the payments          made as follows                i   without reduction based on fault attributed to the employer, officer, agent, or employee          of the employer in the action against the third party if the combined percentage of fault attributed          to persons immune from suit is determined to be less than     prior to any reallocation of fault          under Subsection              or               ii   less the amount of payments made multiplied by the percentage of fault attributed to          the employer, officer, agent, or employee of the employer in the action against the third party if          the combined percentage of fault attributed to persons immune from suit is determined to be              or more prior to any reallocation of fault under Subsection            .               c   The balance shall be paid to the injured employee, or  his  the employee s heirs in case          of death, to be applied to reduce or satisfy in full any obligation thereafter accruing against the          person liable for compensation.                   The apportionment of fault to the employer in a civil action against a third party is not          an action at law and does not impose any liability on the employer.  The apportionment of fault          does not alter or diminish the exclusiveness of the remedy provided to employees, their heirs, or          personal representatives, or the immunity provided employers pursuant to Section    A                   A       or   A       for injuries sustained by an employee, whether resulting in death or not.

As determined by  the department  an administrative law judge, an employee is not          entitled to disability compensation, unless the employee fully cooperates with any evaluation or          reemployment plan under this chapter or Chapter  , Utah Occupational Disease Act.  The           department  administrative law judge shall dismiss without prejudice the claim for benefits of an          employee  who  if the administrative law judge finds that the employee fails to fully cooperate,          unless the  department  administrative law judge states specific findings on the record justifying          dismissal with prejudice.                    a   The loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of both hands, both arms, both          feet, both legs, both eyes, or any combination of two such body members constitutes total and          permanent disability, to be compensated according to this section.               b   A finding of permanent total disability pursuant to Subsection      a  is final.                    a   An insurer or self insured employer may periodically reexamine a permanent total          disability claim, except those based on Subsection     , for which the insurer or self insured          employer had or has payment responsibility to determine whether the worker remains permanently                   totally disabled.              b   Reexamination may be conducted no more than once every three years after an award         is final, unless good cause is shown by the employer or its insurance carrier to allow more frequent         reexaminations.              c   The reexamination may include               i   the review of medical records               ii   employee submission to reasonable medical evaluations               iii   employee submission to reasonable rehabilitation evaluations and retraining efforts               iv   employee disclosure of Federal Income Tax Returns                v   employee certification of compliance with Section    A          A        and               vi   employee completion of sworn affidavits or questionnaires approved by the           department  division.               d   The insurer or self insured employer shall pay for the cost of a reexamination with          appropriate employee reimbursement pursuant to rule for reasonable travel allowance and per diem          as well as reasonable expert witness fees incurred by the employee in supporting the employee s          claim for permanent total disability benefits at the time of reexamination.               e   If an employee fails to fully cooperate in the reasonable reexamination of a permanent          total disability finding,  the department  an administrative law judge may order the suspension of          the employee s permanent total disability benefits until the employee cooperates with the          reexamination.               f   i   Should the reexamination of a permanent total disability finding reveal evidence that          reasonably raises the issue of an employee s continued entitlement to permanent total disability          compensation benefits, an insurer or self insured employer may petition the  department  Division          of Adjudication for a rehearing on that issue.  The petition shall be accompanied by documentation          supporting the insurer s or self insured employer s belief that the employee is no longer          permanently totally disabled.               ii   If the petition under Subsection      f  i  demonstrates good cause,  the department           as determined by the Division of Adjudication, an administrative law judge shall adjudicate the          issue at a hearing.               iii   Evidence of an employee s participation in medically appropriate, part time work may          not be the sole basis for termination of an employee s permanent total disability entitlement, but                   the evidence of the employee s participation in medically appropriate, part time work under         Subsection     may be considered in the reexamination or hearing with other evidence relating to         the employee s status and condition.              g   In accordance with Section    A          A      , the  department  administrative         law judge may award reasonable attorneys fees to an attorney retained by an  employee to         represent the employee s interests with respect to reexamination of the permanent total disability         finding, except if the employee does not prevail, the attorneys fees shall be set at      .  The         attorneys fees shall be paid by the employer or its insurance carrier in addition to the permanent         total disability compensation benefits due.               h   During the period of reexamination or adjudication if the employee fully cooperates,          each insurer, self insured employer, or the Employers  Reinsurance Fund shall continue to pay the          permanent total disability compensation benefits due the employee.                    If any provision of this section, or the application of any provision to any person or          circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this section shall be given effect without the invalid          provision or application.

An employer is liable only for the hearing loss of an employee that arises out of and          in the course of the employee s employment for that employer.                   If previous occupational hearing loss or nonoccupational hearing impairment is          established by competent evidence, the employer  shall  may not be liable for the prior hearing loss          so established, whether or not compensation has previously been paid or awarded.  The employer          is liable only for the difference between the percentage of hearing loss presently established and          that percentage of prior hearing loss established by preemployment audiogram or other competent          evidence.                   The date for compensation for occupational hearing loss shall be determined by the          date of direct head injury or the last date when harmful industrial noise contributed substantially          in causing the hearing loss.

Then, as provided in Subsection    , the         Employers  Reinsurance Fund shall reimburse the employer or its insurance carrier for     of         those expenses.                   After the initial     week period under Subsection    , permanent total disability          compensation payable to an employee under this chapter or Chapter  , Utah Occupational Disease          Act, becomes the liability of and shall be paid by the Employers  Reinsurance Fund.                   If it is determined that the employee is permanently and totally disabled, the employer          or its insurance carrier shall be given credit for all prior payments of temporary total, temporary          partial, and permanent partial disability compensation made as a result of the industrial accident.          Any overpayment by the employer or its insurance carrier shall be reimbursed by the Employers           Reinsurance Fund under Subsection    .                   a   Upon receipt of a duly verified petition, the Employers  Reinsurance Fund shall          reimburse the employer or its insurance carrier for the Employers  Reinsurance Fund s share of          medical benefits and compensation paid to or on behalf of an employee.

Each request          is subject to review as to reasonableness by the  department  administrator.  The  department           administrator may determine the manner of reimbursement.               b   A decision of the administrator under Subsection     a  may be appealed in accordance          with Part  , Adjudication.                   If, at the time an employee is determined to be permanently and totally disabled, the          employee has other actionable workers  compensation claims, the employer or insurance carrier          that is liable for the last industrial accident resulting in permanent total disability shall be liable          for the benefits payable by the employer as provided in this section and Section    A                   A      .  The employee s entitlement to benefits for prior actionable claims shall then be                   determined separately on the facts of those claims.  Any previous permanent partial disability         arising out of those claims shall then be considered to be impairments that may give rise to         Employers  Reinsurance Fund liability under this section.

To the extent of the compensation and other benefits paid or payable to or on behalf          of an employee or the employee s dependents from the Uninsured Employers  Fund, the fund, by          subrogation, has all the rights, powers, and benefits of the employee or the employee s dependents          against the employer failing to make the compensation payments.                   a   The receiver, trustee, liquidator, or statutory successor of an insolvent employer is          bound by settlements of covered claims by the fund.               b   The court with jurisdiction shall grant all payments made under this section a priority          equal to that to which the claimant would have been entitled in the absence of this section against          the assets of the insolvent employer.               c   The expenses of the fund in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the          liquidator s expenses.                   The  department  administrator shall periodically file with the receiver, trustee, or          liquidator of the insolvent employer or insurance carrier statements of the covered claims paid by          the fund and estimates of anticipated claims against the fund which shall preserve the rights of the          fund for claims against the assets of the insolvent employer.                   When any injury or death for which compensation is payable from the Uninsured          Employers  Fund has been caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another person not in the same          employment, the fund has the same rights as allowed under Section    A          A      .                    The fund, subject to approval of the  department  administrator, shall discharge its          obligations by                a   adjusting its own claims  or  by                b   contracting with an adjusting company, risk management company, insurance          company, or other company that has expertise and capabilities in adjusting and paying workers                    compensation claims.                   a   For the purpose of maintaining this fund,  the department  an administrative law         judge, upon rendering a decision with respect to any claim for workers  compensation benefits in         which an uninsured employer was duly joined as a party, shall               i   order the uninsured employer to reimburse the Uninsured Employers  Fund for all         benefits paid to or on behalf of an injured employee by the Uninsured Employers  Fund along with         interest, costs, and attorneys  fees .  The department shall   and              ii   impose a penalty against the uninsured employer of     of the value of the total award         in connection with the claim , and shall direct that the additional penalty  that shall be paid into          the Uninsured Employers  Fund.               b   Awards may be docketed as other awards under this chapter and Chapter  , Utah          Occupational Disease Act.                    The liability of the state, the  department  commission, and the state treasurer, with          respect to payment of any compensation benefits, expenses, fees, or disbursement properly          chargeable against the fund, is limited to the assets in the fund, and they are not otherwise in any          way liable for the making of any payment.                    The  department  commission may make reasonable rules for the processing and          payment of claims for compensation from the fund.                    a    In the event  If it becomes necessary for the Uninsured Employers  Fund to pay          benefits under this section to any employee of an insolvent self insured employer, the Uninsured          Employers  Fund may assess all other self insured employers amounts necessary to pay                i   the obligations of the fund subsequent to an insolvency                ii   the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency                iii   the cost of examinations under Subsection       and               iv   other expenses authorized by this section.               b   The assessments of each self insured employer shall be in the proportion that the          manual premium of the self insured employer for the preceding calendar year bears to the manual          premium of all self insured employers for the preceding calendar year.               c   Each self insured employer shall be notified of the employer s assessment not later than             days before  it  the assessment is due.               d    No  A self insured employer may not be assessed in any year an amount greater than                      of that self insured employer s manual premium for the preceding calendar year.  If the         maximum assessment does not provide in any one year an amount sufficient to make all necessary         payments from the fund for one or more insolvent self insured employers, the unpaid portion shall         be paid as soon as funds become available.              e   All self insured employers are liable under this section for a period not to exceed three         years after the self insured employer s voluntary or involuntary termination of self insurance         privileges within this state.              f   Subsection      does not apply to claims made against an insolvent self insured         employer if the insolvency occurred prior to July  ,     .                    a    It is the duty of all  A self insured  employers to  employer shall notify the           department  division of any information indicating that any self insured employer may be          insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to its employees or the public.               b   Upon receipt of  that  the notification described in Subsection      a  and with good          cause appearing, the  department  division may order an examination of that self insured          employer.  The cost of the examination shall be assessed against all self insured employers as          provided in Subsection      .  The results of the examination shall be kept confidential.                    In any claim against an employer by the Uninsured Employers  Fund, or by or on          behalf of the employee to whom or to whose dependents compensation and other benefits are paid          or payable from the fund, the burden of proof is on the employer or other party in interest objecting          to the claim.  The claim is presumed to be valid up to the full amount of workers  compensation          benefits claimed by the employee or  his  the employee s dependents.  Subsection      applies          whether the claim is filed in court or in an adjudicative proceeding under the authority of the           department  commission.

It is a discriminatory or prohibited employment practice                a   i   for an employer to refuse to hire, or promote, or to discharge, demote, terminate any          person, or to retaliate against, harass, or discriminate in matters of compensation or in terms,          privileges, and conditions of employment against any person otherwise qualified, because of race,          color, sex, pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy related conditions, age, if the individual is    years          of age or older, religion, national origin, or handicap.   No applicant nor candidate for any job or          position may be considered  otherwise qualified,  unless he possesses the education, training,          ability, moral character, integrity, disposition to work, adherence to reasonable rules and          regulations, and other job related qualifications required by an employer for any particular job, job          classification, or position to be filled or created                ii   as used in this chapter,  to discriminate in matters of compensation  means the          payment of differing wages or salaries to employees having substantially equal experience,          responsibilities, and skill for the particular job.  However, nothing in this chapter prevents          increases in pay as a result of longevity with the employer, if the salary increases are uniformly          applied and available to all employees on a substantially proportional basis.

benefits if the employee          is eligible for those payments                b   for an employment agency                         i   to refuse to list and properly classify for employment, or to

this section to be a discriminatory or prohibited employment practice  or to          obstruct or prevent any person from complying with this chapter, or any order issued under it  or          to

religion, national origin, age, if the individual is    years of age or older, or handicap  or               iii   to print, or publish, or cause to be printed or published, any notice or advertisement          relating to employment by the employer, or membership in or any classification or referral for          employment by a labor organization, or relating to any classification or referral for employment          by an employment agency, indicating any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination          based on race, color, sex, pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy related conditions, religion, national          origin, age, if the individual is    years of age or older, or handicap except that a notice or          advertisement may indicate a preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on race,          color, religion, sex, pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy related conditions, age, national origin,          or

It is not a discriminatory or prohibited practice with respect to age to observe the terms         of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employment benefit plan such as a retirement,         pension, or insurance plan which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter except         that no such employee benefit plan shall excuse the failure to hire any individual.                  Notwithstanding Subsection    , or any other statutory provision to the contrary, other         than Subsection     and  Section       , and except where age is a bona fide occupational         qualification, no person shall be subject to involuntary termination or retirement from employment         on the basis of age alone, if the individual is    years of age or older.                   Nothing in this section prohibits compulsory retirement of an employee who has          attained at least    years of age, and who, for the two year period immediately before retirement,          is employed in a bona fide executive or a high policymaking position, if that employee is entitled          to an immediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit from his employer s pension,          profit sharing, savings, or deferred compensation plan, or any combination of those plans, which          benefit equals, in the aggregate, at least    ,   .

The division may issue, modify, or revoke any standard as follows                a   i   Whenever the administrator determines upon the basis of information submitted in          writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees,                   a nationally recognized standards producing organization, the Department of Health  and         Environmental Sciences , or a state agency or political subdivision, or on information developed         by the division or otherwise available, that a rule should be promulgated to promote the objectives         of this chapter,  he  the administrator may request recommendations from the advisory council.              ii   The administrator shall provide the advisory council with proposals, together with all         pertinent factual information developed by the division, or otherwise available, including the         results of research, demonstrations, and experiments.              iii   The advisory council shall submit to the administrator its recommendations regarding         the rule to be promulgated within a period as prescribed by the administrator.               b   The division shall publish a proposed rule issuing, modifying, or revoking an          occupational safety or health standard and shall afford interested parties an opportunity to submit          written data or comments as prescribed by Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking          Act.  When the administrator determines that a rule should be issued,  it  the division shall publish          the proposed rule after the submission of the advisory council s recommendations or the expiration          of the period prescribed by the administrator for submission.               c   The administrator, in issuing standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents          under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible,          on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of          health or functional capacity even if the employee has regular exposure to the hazard during  his           an employee s working life.  Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon          research, demonstrations, experiments, and other information deemed appropriate.  In addition to          the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for the employee, other          considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the          standards, and experience under this and other health and safety laws.  Whenever practicable, the          standard shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.               d   i   Any employer may apply to the administrator for a temporary order granting a          variance from a standard issued under this section.  Temporary orders shall be granted only if the          employer                A   files an application which meets the requirements of Subsection     d  iv                 B   establishes that  he  the employer is unable to comply with a standard by its effective          date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment                   needed for compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of         facilities cannot be completed by the effective date               C   establishes that  he  the employer is taking all available steps to safeguard  his  the         employer s employees against hazards  and              D   establishes that  he  the employer has an effective program for compliance as quickly         as practicable.              ii   Any temporary order shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations, and         processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail          his  the employer s program for compliance with the standard.  A temporary order may be granted          only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a public hearing  provided, that the          administrator may issue one interim order effective until a decision is made after public hearing.               iii    No  A temporary order may not be in effect longer than the period reasonably          required by the employer to achieve compliance.  In no case shall the period of a temporary order          exceed one year.               iv   An application for a temporary order under Subsection     d  shall contain                A   a specification of the standard or part from which the employer seeks a variance                B   a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons          having first hand knowledge of the facts represented, that  he  the employer is unable to comply          with the standard or some part of the standard  and                 C   a detailed statement of the reasons the employer is unable to comply                 C    D   a statement of the measures taken and anticipated with specific dates, to protect          employees against the hazard                 D    E   a statement of when  he  the employer expects to comply with the standard and          what measures  he  the employer has taken and those anticipated, giving specific dates for          compliance  and                E    F   a certification that  he  the employer has informed  his  the employer s employees          of the application by                I   giving a copy to their authorized representative ,                 II   posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy          may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted ,   and               III   by other appropriate means.                        v   The certification required under Subsection     d  iv  shall contain a description of         how employees have been informed.              vi   The information to employees required under Subsection     d  v  shall inform the         employees of their right to petition the  department  division for a hearing.               vi    vii   The administrator is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or some         part of the standard  whenever he  when the administrator determines that it is necessary to permit         an employer to participate in a research and development project approved by the administrator         to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of         workers.               e   i   Any standard issued under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other          forms of warning necessary to ensure that employees are apprised of all hazards, relevant          symptoms and emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or          exposure.   Where   When appropriate, a standard shall prescribe suitable protective equipment          and control or technological procedures for use in connection with such hazards and provide for          monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in a manner          necessary for the protection of employees.  In addition, any such standard shall prescribe the type          and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available by the          employer, or at his cost, to employees exposed to hazards in order to most effectively determine          whether the health of employees is adversely affected by exposure.  If medical examinations are          in the nature of research as determined by the division, the examinations may be furnished at          division expense.  The results of such examinations or tests shall be furnished only to the division           and, at the request of the employee, to  his  the employee s physician.               ii   The administrator may by rule make appropriate modifications in requirements for the          use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical examinations          warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments acquired          subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.               f   Whenever a rule issued by the administrator differs substantially from an existing          national consensus standard, the division shall publish a statement of the reasons why the rule as          adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.               g   Whenever a rule, standard, or national consensus standard is modified by the secretary          so as to make less restrictive the federal Williams Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of                       ,  said  the less restrictive modification shall be immediately applicable to this chapter and         shall be immediately implemented by the division.                  a   The administrator shall provide an emergency temporary standard to take         immediate effect upon publication if  he  the administrator determines that               i   employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents         determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards  and              ii   that the standard is necessary to protect employees from danger.              b   An emergency standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard issued in         accordance with the procedures prescribed in Subsection     c .               c   Upon publication of an emergency standard the division shall commence a proceeding          in accordance with Subsection     and the standard as published shall serve as a proposed rule for          the proceedings.  The division shall issue a standard under Subsection     no later than     days          after publication of the emergency standard.                   a   Any affected employer may apply to the division for a rule or order for a variance          from a standard issued under this section.  Affected employees shall be given notice of each          application and may participate in a hearing.  The administrator shall issue  such  a rule or order          if  he  the administrator determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where          appropriate and a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance          of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or          proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and a workplace to  his  the          employer s employees  which  that are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if  he           the employer complied with the standard.               b   The rule or order issued under Subsection     a  shall prescribe the conditions the          employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations and processes  which he           that the employer must adopt and  utilize  use to the extent they differ from the standard in          question.               c   A rule or order issued under Subsection     a  may be modified or revoked upon          application by an employer, employees, or by the administrator on its own motion, in the manner          prescribed for its issuance under Subsection     at any time after six months from its issuance.                    Whenever  The administrator shall include a statement of reasons for the          administrator s actions when the administrator                         a   issues any code, standard, rule, or order , or                b   grants any exemption or extension of time ,   or              c   compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this  chapter , he shall         include a statement of the reasons for his action .                  Any person adversely affected by a standard issued under this section, at any time prior         to    days after a standard is issued, may file a petition challenging its validity with the district         court having jurisdiction for judicial review.  A copy of the petition shall be served upon the         division by the petitioner.  The filing of a petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court,         operate as a stay of the standard.  The determinations of the division shall be conclusive if          supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.                   In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the division          shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for          particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments.           The administrator shall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Department of Health           and Environmental Sciences  about the need for mandatory standards in determining the priority          for establishing  such  the standards.

When division approval is given for civil action against an          employer or claimant, the division may cooperate with the private collector to the extent necessary          to effect the civil action.               d   i   Notwithstanding Section   A      , the division may disclose the contribution,          interest, penalties or benefit overpayments and penalties, costs due, the name of the employer or          claimant, and the employer s or claimant s address and telephone number when any collection          matter is referred to a private collector under Subsection     c .               ii   A private collector is subject to the confidentiality requirements and penalty provisions          provided in Section   A       and Subsection   A         , except to the extent disclosure is          necessary in any civil action to enforce collection of the amounts due.               e    No  An action taken by the division under this section , shall  may not be construed          to be an election to forego other collection procedures by the division.                   a   In the event of any distribution of an employer s assets under an order of any court          under the laws of Utah, including any receivership, assignment for benefits of creditors,          adjudicated insolvency, composition, or similar proceedings, contributions then or thereafter due          shall be paid in full prior to all other claims except taxes and claims for wages of not more than               to each claimant, earned within five months of the commencement of the proceeding.               b   If an employer commences a proceeding in the Federal Bankruptcy Court under any                   chapter of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of     ,    U.S.C.     et seq., as amended, contributions,         interest, and penalties then or thereafter due shall be entitled to the priority provided for taxes,         interest, and penalties in the Bankruptcy Reform Act of     .                  a   In addition and as an alternative to any other remedy provided by this chapter and         provided that no appeal or other proceeding for review provided by this chapter is then pending         and the time for taking it has expired, the division may issue a warrant in duplicate, under its         official seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding the sheriff to levy upon         and sell the real and personal property of a delinquent employer or claimant found within the         sheriff s county for the payment of the contributions due thereon, with the added penalties, interest,          or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs, and to return the warrant to the division and pay          into the fund the money collected by virtue  thereof  of the warrant by a time to be therein          specified, not more than    days from the date of the warrant.               b   Immediately upon receipt of the warrant in duplicate, the sheriff shall file the duplicate          with the clerk of the district court in the sheriff s county.  The clerk shall enter in the judgment          docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the delinquent employer or claimant          mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the amount of the contribution, penalties,          interest, or benefit overpayment and penalties, and costs, for which the warrant is issued and the          date when the duplicate is filed.               c   The amount of the warrant so docketed shall                i   have the force and effect of an execution against all personal property of the delinquent          employer  and  shall also                ii   become a lien upon the real property of the delinquent employer or claimant in the          same manner and to the same extent as a judgment duly rendered by any district court and          docketed in the office of the clerk.               d   After docketing, the sheriff shall                i   proceed in the same manner as is prescribed by law with respect to execution issued          against property upon judgments of a court of record ,   and  shall                ii   be entitled to the same fees for the sheriff s services in executing the warrant, to be          collected in the same manner.                   a   Contributions imposed by this chapter are a lien upon the property of any employer          liable for the contribution required to be collected under this section who shall sell out the                   employer s business or stock of goods or shall quit business, if the employer fails to make a final         report and payment on the date subsequent to the date of selling or quitting business on which they         are due and payable as prescribed by rule.              b   An employer s successor, successors, or assigns, if any, shall be required to withhold         sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of the contributions and interest or penalties         due and payable until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the division         showing that they have been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due.  If the purchaser         of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold sufficient purchase money  as above provided ,         the purchaser shall be personally liable for the payment of the amount of the contributions required          to be paid by the former owner, interest and penalties accrued and unpaid by the former owner,          owners, or assignors.                   a    In the event that  If any employer is delinquent in the payment of any contribution,          the  division may give notice of the amount of the delinquency by registered mail to all persons          having in their possession or under their control, any credits or other personal property belonging          to the employer, or owing any debts to the employer at the time of the receipt by them of the notice           and thereafter any .               b   Any persons notified under Subsection     a  shall neither transfer nor make any other          disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts until                i   the division has consented to a transfer or disposition ,   or  until                ii      days after the receipt of the notice.                b    c   All persons  so  notified  must,  under Subsection     a  shall within five days          after receipt of the notice, advise the  division of credits, other personal property, or other debts          in their possession, under their control or owing by them, as the case may be.                   a   Each employer shall furnish the division necessary information for the proper          administration of this chapter and shall include wage information for each employee, for each          calendar quarter beginning October  ,     .  The information shall be furnished at a time, in the          form, and to those individuals as the department may by rule require.               b   Each employer shall furnish each individual worker who is separated that information          as the department may by rule require, and shall furnish within    hours of the receipt of a request          from the division a report of the earnings of any individual during the individual s base period.           The report shall be on a form prescribed by the division and contain all information prescribed by                   the  division.              c   For each failure by an employer to conform to  the provisions of  this Subsection             the  division shall, unless good cause is shown to the satisfaction of the division for the failure,         assess a     penalty to be collected in the same manner as contributions due under this chapter.                  If any person liable to pay any contribution or benefit overpayment imposed by this         chapter neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount, including any interest,         additional amount, addition to contributions, or assessable penalty, together with any additional         accruable costs, shall be a lien in favor of the division upon all property and rights to property,         whether real or personal belonging to the person.                    a   The lien imposed by Subsection     arises at the time the assessment, as defined          in the department rules, is made and continues until the liability for the amount so assessed, or a          judgment against the taxpayer arising out of the liability, is satisfied.               b   The lien imposed by Subsection     is not valid as against any purchaser, holder of a          security interest, mechanics lien holder, or judgment lien creditor until a warrant which meets the          requirements of Subsection     has been filed with the clerk of the district court.

A judgment          lien does not include inchoate liens such as attachment or garnishment liens until they ripen into          a judgment.  A judgment lien does not include the determination or assessment of a quasi judicial          authority, such as a state or federal taxing authority.               ii    Mechanics lien holder  means any person who has a lien on real property, or on the          proceeds of a contract relating to real property, for services, labor, or materials furnished in          connection with the construction or improvement of the property.

A          security interest exists at any time                A   the property is in existence and the interest has become protected under the law against          a subsequent judgment lien arising out of an unsecured obligation  and               B   to the extent that, at that time, the holder has parted with money or money s worth.

Notification by the division that a worker has filed an initial claim for unemployment          insurance benefits will be sent to all base period employers and all subsequent employers prior to          the payment of benefits. Any employing unit that receives a notice of the filing of a claim may          protest payment of benefits to former employees or charges to the employer if the protest is filed          within ten days after the date the notice is issued.                   On or before November   of each year beginning November  ,     , each employer          shall receive notification of all benefit costs of former workers that have been charged to that          employer in the immediately preceding fiscal year.  Any employing unit that receives a notice of          benefit charges may protest the correctness of the charges if the protest is filed within    days after          the date the notice is issued.                   On written request made by an employer, corrections or modifications of the                   employer s wages shall be taken into account for the purpose of redetermining  his  the employer s         contribution rate.  The request shall be made to the  department  division no later than the end of         the calendar year following the year for which the contribution rate is assigned.  The division may,         within a like period upon its own initiative, redetermine an employer s contribution rate.                  a   If no later than three years after the date on which any contributions or interest or         penalty  thereon  for contributions were due, an employer who has paid the contributions, interest,         or penalty may make application for an adjustment in connection with subsequent contribution         payments, or for a refund because the adjustment cannot be made, and the division shall determine         that the contributions or interest or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously collected, the          division shall allow the employer to make an adjustment, without interest, in connection with          subsequent contribution payments by  him  the employer, or if the adjustment cannot be made, the          division shall refund that amount, without interest.               b   Refunds of contributions shall be made from the clearing account or the benefit          account in the fund, and refunds of interest and penalty shall be made from the special          administrative expense fund or from the interest and penalty moneys in the clearing account of the          fund.               c   For like cause and within the same period, an adjustment or refund may be made on          the  division s own initiative.               d   Decisions with respect to applications for refund are final unless the employing unit,          within ten days after the mailing or personal delivery of notice of the decision, applies to the           division for a review of the decision as provided in Section   A      .

The records shall be open to inspection and          subject to being copied by the division or its authorized representatives at any reasonable time and          as often as may be necessary.  The employing unit shall make the records available in the state for          three years after the calendar year in which the services were rendered.

Section    .  Section         .  is amended to read                      . .  Determination of gross income    Imputed income.                  As used in the guidelines,  gross income  includes               a   prospective income from any source, including nonearned sources, except under          Subsection      and               b   income from salaries, wages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, rents, gifts from anyone,          prizes, dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, alimony from previous          marriages, annuities, capital gains, social security benefits, workers  compensation benefits,          unemployment compensation, disability insurance benefits, and payments from  nonmeans tested           government programs.                   Income from earned income sources is limited to the equivalent of one full time             hour job.  However, if and only if during the time prior to the original support order, the parent          normally and consistently worked more than    hours at his job, the court may consider this extra          time as a pattern in calculating the parent s ability to provide child support.                   Specifically excluded from gross income are                a   Aid to Families with Dependent Children  AFDC                 b   benefits received under a housing subsidy program, the Job Training Partnership Act,          S.S.I., Medicaid, Food Stamps, or General Assistance  and               c   other similar means tested welfare benefits received by a parent.                   a   Gross income from self employment or operation of a business shall be calculated          by subtracting necessary expenses required for self employment or business operation from gross          receipts.  The income and expenses from self employment or operation of a business shall be          reviewed to determine an appropriate level of gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child          support award.  Only those expenses necessary to allow the business to operate at a reasonable          level may be deducted from gross receipts.               b   Gross income determined under this subsection may differ from the amount of business                   income determined for tax purposes.                  a   When possible, gross income should first be computed on an annual basis and then         recalculated to determine the average gross monthly income.              b   Each parent shall provide verification of current income.  Each parent shall provide         year to date pay stubs or employer statements and complete copies of tax returns from at least the         most recent year unless the court finds the verification is not reasonably available.  Verification         of income from records maintained by the  Office of Employment Security  Department of         Workforce Services may be substituted for pay stubs, employer statements, and income tax returns.              c   Historical and current earnings shall be used to determine whether an          underemployment or overemployment situation exists.                   Gross income includes income imputed to the parent under Subsection    .                   a   Income may not be imputed to a parent unless the parent stipulates to the amount          imputed or a hearing is held and a finding made that the parent is voluntarily unemployed or          underemployed.               b   If income is imputed to a parent, the income shall be based upon employment potential          and probable earnings as derived from work history, occupation qualifications, and prevailing          earnings for persons of similar backgrounds in the community.               c   If a parent has no recent work history, income shall be imputed at least at the federal          minimum wage for a    hour work week.  To impute a greater income, the judge in a judicial          proceeding or the presiding officer in an administrative proceeding shall enter specific findings          of fact as to the evidentiary basis for the imputation.               d   Income may not be imputed if any of the following conditions exist                i   the reasonable costs of child care for the parents  minor children approach or equal the          amount of income the custodial parent can earn                ii   a parent is physically or mentally disabled to the extent he cannot earn minimum wage                iii   a parent is engaged in career or occupational training to establish basic job skills  or               iv   unusual emotional or physical needs of a child require the custodial parent s presence          in the home.                   a   Gross income may not include the earnings of a child who is the subject of a child          support award nor benefits to a child in the child s own right such as Supplemental Security          Income.                        b   Social Security benefits received by a child due to the earnings of a parent may be         credited as child support to the parent upon whose earning record it is based, by crediting the         amount against the potential obligation of that parent.  Other unearned income of a child may be         considered as income to a parent depending upon the circumstances of each case.             Section    .   Reappointment of committees.                  a   The term of a member of the following council or committee as of June   ,     ,         shall terminate July  ,                    i   employment security advisory council created in Section   A        and              ii   child care advisory committee created in Section   A       .               b   The reappointment of the members to the council or committee listed in Subsection              a  shall be in accordance to the applicable statute creating the council or committee.

Legislative Review Note      as of                  AM    This bill implements significant changes to the structure of state government. The structural  changes include transferring certain responsibilities that have previously been exercised by an  independent state agency to an executive branch entity and more specifically separating regulatory  functions from adjudicative functions. The restructuring in both its size and complexity is without  precedent in the recent history of the state.  While an attempt has been made to address the federal  and state constitutional or statutory concerns raised as a result of the restructuring, a determination  cannot be made as to whether all legal implications have been fully resolved.
