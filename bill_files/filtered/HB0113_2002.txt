Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM      This bill raises federal constitutional issues under the United States Supreme Court s interpretation  of the Property Clause, Article IV, Section  , Clause   of the United States Constitution. The  Property Clause provides that Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules  and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States. The  United States Supreme Court held in Kleppe v. New Mexico,     U.S.           , that when  Congress acts under the Property Clause, federal law overrides inconsistent state law under the  Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Clause   of the United States Constitution. Occasionally,  exemptions from the preemption doctrine of the Supremacy Clause have been granted by courts,  if the state can convince the court that under its police power the statute was necessary to protect  the health and safety of the public.
