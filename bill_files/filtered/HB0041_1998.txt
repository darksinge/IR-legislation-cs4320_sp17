HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY COVERAGE                 GENERAL SESSION          STATE OF UTAH           Sponsor   Peter C. Knudson          AN ACT RELATING TO INSURANCE  REQUIRING AN INSURANCE POLICY TO COVER         DIAGNOSTIC AND SURGICAL PROCEDURES INVOLVING BONES OR JOINTS OF         THE JAW AND FACIAL REGION TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IT COVERS         DIAGNOSTIC AND SURGICAL PROCEDURES INVOLVING OTHER BONES OR         JOINTS OF THE SKELETON.          This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows           AMENDS                  A       , as last amended by Chapter   , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section    A        is amended to read                  A       .  Permitted provisions for disability insurance policies.              The following provisions may be contained in a disability insurance policy, but if they are          in that policy, they shall conform to at least the following minimum requirements for the          policyholder                    Any provision respecting change of occupation may provide only for a lower          maximum benefit payment and for reduction of loss payments proportionate to the change in          appropriate premium rates, if the change is to a higher rated occupation, and this provision shall          provide for retroactive reduction of premium rates from the date of change of occupation or the          last policy anniversary date, whichever is the more recent, if the change is to a lower rated          occupation.                   Section   A        applies to misstatement of age in disability policies, with the          appropriate modifications of terminology.                   Any policy which contains a provision establishing, as an age limit or otherwise, a date           after which the coverage provided by the policy is not effective, and if that date falls within a         period for which a premium is accepted by the insurer or if the insurer accepts a premium after that         date, the coverage provided by the policy continues in force, subject to any right of cancellation,         until the end of the period for which the premium was accepted.   This subsection does not apply         if the acceptance of premium would not have occurred but for a misstatement of age by the         insured.                  Any provision dealing with preexisting conditions shall be consistent with Subsections           A           a  and   A          , and any applicable rule adopted by the commissioner.                  a   If an insured is otherwise eligible for maternity benefits, a policy may not contain          language which requires  an insured to obtain any additional preauthorization or preapproval for          customary and reasonable maternity care expenses or for the delivery of the child after an initial          preauthorization or preapproval has been obtained from the insurer for prenatal care.  A          requirement for notice of admission for delivery is not a requirement for preauthorization or          preapproval, however, the maternity benefit may not be denied or diminished for failure to provide          admission notice.  The policy may not require the provision of admission notice by only the          insured patient.               b   This subsection does not prohibit an insurer from                i   requiring a referral before maternity care can be obtained                ii   specifying a group of providers or a particular location from which an insured is          required to obtain maternity care  or               iii   limiting reimbursement for maternity expenses and benefits in accordance with the          terms and conditions of the insurance contract so long as such terms do not conflict with          Subsection     a .                   A policy that provides coverage for diagnostic or surgical procedures involving bones          or joints of the skeleton shall cover to the same extent, and subject to the same contract terms,          diagnostic and surgical procedures involving bones or joints of the jaw and facial region if, under          medically accepted standards, the procedure or surgery is medically necessary to treat conditions          caused by congenital or developmental deformity, disease, or injury.
