Highlighted Provisions                                This bill                                .    defines  family food                                 .    prohibits local or federal regulation of certain food that is grown by an individual                           for use by the individual or the individual s family unless                                    .    the food poses a risk to health, the spreading of insect infestation, or the                           spreading of agricultural disease  or                                   .    the food is unlawfully possessed  and                               .    prohibits a government entity from confiscating certain food that is grown or stored                           by an individual for use by the individual or the individual s family unless                                    .    the food poses a risk to health, the spreading of insect infestation, or the                           spreading of agricultural disease  or                                   .    the food is unlawfully possessed.

Section              is enacted to read                                     .  Growing or storing food for personal or family use.                                    As used in this section,  family food  means food owned by an individual that is                          intended for the individual s use, or for use by members of the individual s immediate family,                          that                                 a   is legal for human consumption                                 b   is lawfully possessed  and                                c   poses no risk                                 i   to health                                 ii   of spreading insect infestation  or                                iii   of spreading agricultural disease.                                    Family food that is grown by an individual on the individual s property is not                          subject to local or federal regulation if growth of the family food                                 a   does not negatively impact the rights of adjoining property owners  and                                b   complies with the food safety requirements of this title.                                    A government entity may not confiscate family food described in Subsection     or                          family food that is stored by the owner in the owner s home or dwelling.                                    If any provision of this section or the application of any provision of this section to                          any person or circumstance is held invalid by a final decision of a court of competent                          jurisdiction, the remainder of this section shall be given effect without the invalid provision or                          application.  The provisions of this section are severable.       Legislative Review Note      as of                PM    As required by legislative rule and practice, the Office of Legislative Research and General  Counsel provides the following legislative review note to assist the Legislature in making its  own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill.  The note is based on an analysis of  relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the bill.  The note is not written for  the purpose of influencing whether the bill should become law, but is written to provide  information relevant to the legislators  consideration of this bill.  The note is not a substitute  for the judgment of the judiciary, which has authority to determine the constitutionality of a  law in the context of a specific case.   This bill provides that, subject to certain exceptions, food grown by an individual and intended  for personal or family use is not subject to federal regulation.  In addition, this bill provides  that, subject to certain exceptions, food either grown or stored by an individual that is intended  for the individual s use or for use by the individual s family may not be confiscated by a  government entity. As drafted, this bill raises issues relating to the Supremacy Clause,  contained in Article VI of the United States Constitution.  The United States Supreme Court  has  long recognized that state laws that conflict with federal law are  without effect.    Altria  Group, Inc. v. Good,     U.S.   ,          , quoting Maryland v. Louisiana,     U.S.    ,            .   The United States Supreme Court has held that the United States Congress has broad power to  regulate purely intrastate activity under the Commerce Clause of the United States  Constitution.  Gonzales v. Raich,     U.S.  ,             Congress can regulate purely  intrastate activity . . . if it concludes that failure to regulate that class of activity would undercut  the regulation of the interstate market in that commodity.    U.S. Const. art. I,    , cl.  .   Moreover, even if the growing and storing of food described in this bill is not considered  commercial activity, the Supreme Court has held that Congress may regulate intrastate activity  if it substantially affects interstate commerce.  United States v. Lopez,     U.S.    ,            .  Finally, the United States Supreme Court has explained that the regulation of  agricultural commodities is a fundamental example of what Congress may regulate under the  Commerce Clause.  Wickard v. Filburn,     U.S.    ,             holding that Congress may  regulate wholly intrastate conduct even the growing of wheat for consumption only by the  grower if  it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce.  .   Based on this authority, to the extent this bill conflicts with federal regulation of commerce,  there is a high probability that a court would find that this legislation violates the Supremacy  Clause of the United States Constitution.
