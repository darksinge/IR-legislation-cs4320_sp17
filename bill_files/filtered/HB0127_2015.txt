Advertising Act, to the extent applicable.              c   A county s denial of a billboard owner s request to relocate or rebuild a billboard        structure, or to take other measures, in order to correct a mistake in the placement or erection of        a billboard does not constitute the initiation of acquisition by eminent domain under Subsection            a  if the mistake in placement or erection of the billboard is determined by clear and        convincing evidence to have resulted from an intentionally false or misleading statement               i   by the billboard applicant in the application  and              ii   regarding the placement or erection of the billboard.              d   If a county is considered to have initiated the acquisition of a billboard structure by        eminent domain under Subsection     a  or any other provision of applicable law, the county        shall pay just compensation to the billboard owner in an amount that is               i   the value of the existing billboard at a fair market capitalization rate, based on        actual annual revenue, less any annual rent expense               ii   the value of any other right associated with the billboard structure that is acquired               iii   the cost of the sign structure  and              iv   damage to the economic unit described in Subsection             b , of which the        billboard owner s interest is a part.                  Notwithstanding Subsection     and Section      a    , a county may remove a        billboard without providing compensation if               a   the county determines               i   by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant for a permit intentionally made a        false or misleading statement in the applicant s application regarding the placement or erection        of the billboard  or              ii   by substantial evidence that the billboard               A   is structurally unsafe               B   is in an unreasonable state of repair  or              C   has been abandoned for at least    months               b   the county notifies the owner in writing that the owner s billboard meets one or        more of the conditions listed in Subsections     a  i  and  ii                c   the owner fails to remedy the condition or conditions within               i   except as provided in Subsection     c  ii ,    days following the billboard owner s        receipt of written notice under Subsection     b   or              ii   if the condition forming the basis of the county s intention to remove the billboard        is that it is structurally unsafe,    business days, or a longer period if necessary because of a        natural disaster, following the billboard owner s receipt of written notice under Subsection            b   and              d   following the expiration of the applicable period under Subsection     c  and after        providing the owner with reasonable notice of proceedings and an opportunity for a hearing,        the county finds               i   by clear and convincing evidence, that the applicant for a permit intentionally made        a false or misleading statement in the application regarding the placement or erection of the        billboard  or              ii   by substantial evidence that the billboard is structurally unsafe, is in an        unreasonable state of repair, or has been abandoned for at least    months.                  A county may not allow a nonconforming billboard to be rebuilt or replaced by        anyone other than its owner or the owner acting through its contractors.                  A permit issued, extended, or renewed by a county for a billboard remains valid        from the time the county issues, extends, or renews the permit until     days after a required        state permit is issued for the billboard if               a   the billboard requires a state permit  and              b   an application for the state permit is filed within    days after the county issues,        extends, or renews a permit for the billboard.Legislative Review Note     as of                  AMOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
