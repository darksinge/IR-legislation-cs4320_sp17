An enrolled nonresident student shall be permitted to remain enrolled in a school,                            subject to the same rules and standards as resident students, without renewed applications in                            subsequent years unless one of the following occurs                                  a   the student graduates                                  b   the student is no longer a Utah resident                                  c   the student is suspended or expelled from school  or                                 d   the district determines that enrollment within the school will exceed the school s                            open enrollment threshold.                                     a   Determination of which nonresident students will be excluded from continued                            enrollment in a school during a subsequent year under Subsection     d  is based upon time in                            the school, with those most recently enrolled being excluded first and the use of a lottery                            system when multiple nonresident students have the same number of school days in the school.                                 b   Nonresident students who will not be permitted to continue their enrollment shall                            be notified no later than March    of the current school year.                                     The parent or guardian of a student enrolled in a school that is not the student s                            school of residence may withdraw the student from that school for enrollment in another public                            school by submitting notice of intent to enroll the student in                                  a   the district of residence  or                                 b   another nonresident district.                                     Unless provisions have previously been made for enrollment in another school, a                            nonresident district releasing a student from enrollment shall immediately notify the district of                            residence, which shall enroll the student in the resident district and take such additional steps                            as may be necessary to ensure compliance with laws governing school attendance.                                      a   Except as provided in Subsection      c , a student who transfers between                            schools, whether effective on the first day of the school year or after the school year has begun,                            by exercising an open enrollment option under this section may not transfer to a different                            school during the same school year by exercising an open enrollment option under this section.                                 b   The restriction on transfers specified in Subsection      a  does not apply to a                               student transfer made for health or safety reasons.                                 c   A local school board may adopt a policy allowing a student to exercise an open                            enrollment option more than once in a school year.                                      Notwithstanding Subsections     and     d , a student who is enrolled in a school                            that is not the student s school of residence, because school bus service is not provided between                            the student s neighborhood and school of residence for safety reasons                                  a   shall be allowed to continue to attend the school until the student finishes the                            highest grade level offered  and                                 b   shall be allowed to attend the middle school, junior high school, or high school into                            which the school s students feed until the student graduates from high school.                                      Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, a student shall be allowed to                            enroll in any charter school or other public school in any district, including a district where the                            student does not reside, if the enrollment is necessary, as determined by the Division of Child                            and Family Services, to comply with the provisions of    U.S.C.
