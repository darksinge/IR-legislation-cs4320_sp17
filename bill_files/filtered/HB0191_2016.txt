buying and installing and maintaining the system.              b   A probationer may not be excluded from this section for inability to pay the costs,        unless               i   the probationer files an affidavit of impecuniosity  and              ii   the court enters a finding that the probationer is impecunious.              c   In lieu of waiver of the entire amount of the cost, the court may direct the        probationer to make partial or installment payments of costs when appropriate.              d   The ignition interlock provider shall cover the costs of waivers by the court under        this Subsection    .                  a   If a probationer is required in the course and scope of employment to operate a        motor vehicle owned by the probationer s employer, the probationer may operate that motor        vehicle without installation of an ignition interlock system only if               i   the motor vehicle is used in the course and scope of employment               ii   the employer has been notified that the employee is restricted  and              iii   the employee has  proof of the notification  employer verification in the        employee s possession while operating the employer s motor vehicle.              b   i   To the extent that an employer owned motor vehicle is made available to a        probationer subject to this section for personal use, no exemption under this section shall apply.              ii   A probationer intending to operate an employer owned motor vehicle for personal        use and who is restricted to the operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock        system shall notify the employer and obtain consent in writing from the employer to install a        system in the employer owned motor vehicle.              c   A motor vehicle owned by a business entity that is all or partly owned or controlled        by a probationer subject to this section is not a motor vehicle owned by the employer and does        not qualify for an exemption under this Subsection    .                  a   In accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act,        the commissioner shall make rules setting standards for the certification of ignition interlock        systems.              b   The standards under Subsection     a  shall require that the system               i   not impede the safe operation of the motor vehicle               ii   have features that make circumventing difficult and that do not interfere with the        normal use of the motor vehicle               iii   require a deep lung breath sample as a measure of breath alcohol concentration               iv   prevent the motor vehicle from being started if the driver s breath alcohol        concentration exceeds a specified level               v   work accurately and reliably in an unsupervised environment               vi   resist tampering and give evidence if tampering is attempted               vii   operate reliably over the range of motor vehicle environments  and              viii   be manufactured by a party who will provide liability insurance.              c   The commissioner may adopt in whole or in part, the guidelines, rules, studies, or        independent laboratory tests relied upon in certification of ignition interlock systems by other        states.              d   A list of certified systems shall be published by the commissioner and the cost of        certification shall be borne by the manufacturers or dealers of ignition interlock systems        seeking to sell, offer for sale, or lease the systems.              e   i   In accordance with Section   J      , the commissioner may establish an        annual dollar assessment against the manufacturers of ignition interlock systems distributed in        the state for the costs incurred in certifying.              ii   The assessment under Subsection     e  i  shall be apportioned among the        manufacturers on a fair and reasonable basis.              f   The commissioner shall require a provider of an ignition interlock system certified        in accordance with this section to comply with the requirements of Title   , Chapter  , Part   ,        Ignition Interlock System Program Act.                  A violation of this section is a class C misdemeanor.                   There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall        arise against, the state or its employees in connection with the installation, use, operation,        maintenance, or supervision of an interlock ignition system as required under this section.
