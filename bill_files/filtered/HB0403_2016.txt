The prima facie showing shall be made as to each defendant and include a detailed        narrative medical report and diagnosis signed under oath by a qualified physician, who is        board certified in pathology, pulmonary medicine or oncology, that includes               a   radiological or pathological evidence of silicosis or a high resolution computed        tomography scan showing evidence of silicosis               b   evidence verifying that at least    years have elapsed between the exposed person s        date of first exposure to silica and the date of diagnosis  and              c   the qualified physician signing the detailed narrative medical report in this        Subsection     has concluded that exposure to silica was a substantial contributing factor to the        exposed person s primary cancer or physical impairment and not more probably the result of        other causes.                  A qualified physician s opinion stating that the medical findings and primary cancer        or physical impairment are  consistent with  or  compatible with  exposure to silica, or words        to that effect, does not satisfy the requirement described in Subsection     c .                  The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing and determine if the exposed person has        established a prima facie showing of a primary cancer or physical impairment to which        exposure to silica was a substantial contributing factor.              Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Elements of physical impairment.              Evidence relating to physical impairment under this part, including pulmonary function        testing and diffusing studies, offered in an action governed by this part, shall satisfy the        following requirements                   the evidence shall comply with the quality controls, equipment requirements,        methods of calibration and techniques set forth in the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of        Permanent Impairment, and all standards set forth in the official statements of the American        Thoracic Society, which are in effect on the date of any examination or pulmonary function        testing of the exposed person required by this part                   the evidence may not be obtained by, or based on, testing or examinations that        violate any law, regulation, licensing requirement, or medical code of practice of the state in        which the examination, test, or screening was conducted, or of this state  and                  the evidence may not be obtained under the condition that the plaintiff or exposed        person retains the legal services of the attorney or law firm sponsoring the examination, test, or        screening.              Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Procedures.                   The existence of evidence relating to the prima facie showings required in this part        does not create a presumption that the exposed person has an asbestos related or silica related        injury or impairment and may not be conclusive as to the liability of any defendant.                  Evidence may not be offered at trial, and the jury may not be informed, of               a   the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss an asbestos or silica action under the        provisions of this part  or              b   the provisions of this part with respect to what constitutes a prima facie showing of        asbestos or silica related impairment.                  Until a court enters an order determining that the exposed person has established        prima facie evidence of impairment, an asbestos or silica action may not be subject to        discovery, except               a   discovery related to establishing or challenging the prima facie evidence  or              b   by order of the trial court upon motion of a party and for good cause shown.                  a   A court may consolidate for trial any number and type of asbestos or silica        actions with the consent of all the parties.              b   In the absence of consent described in Subsection     a , the court may consolidate        for trial only asbestos or silica actions relating to the exposed person and members of that        person s household.              c   No class action or any other form of mass aggregation relating to more than one        exposed person and members of those persons  households may be permitted.              d   The provisions of this Subsection     do not preclude consolidation of cases by        court order for pretrial or discovery purposes.              Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Limitations on liability in asbestos and silica actions.                   A premises owner, or any entity performing operations on a premises, is not liable        in an asbestos or silica action for exposures that do not occur on the premises.                  A defendant in an asbestos or silica action may not be liable for exposures from a        product or component part made or sold by a third party, even if the third party is insolvent or        otherwise not amenable to suit.                  Punitive damages may not be awarded in an asbestos or silica action.              Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Requirements for proof of causation.              The following standards for proof of causation apply in any asbestos action involving        multiple sources of exposures                   proof of  any exposure  to a defendant s product may not suffice and instead the        plaintiff shall establish the dose of asbestos fibers to which the exposed person was exposed to        from each defendant s product                   the dose shall be quantified but need not be established with mathematical        precision                   the plaintiff shall establish that the defendant s product was a substantial factor in        causing the plaintiff s disease                   the defendant s product is not a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff s disease if,        in light of the evidence of the plaintiff s total exposure to asbestos or other toxins, reasonable        persons would not regard the defendant s product as a cause of the disease  and                  the plaintiff, in the absence of direct evidence of causation, shall prove substantial        factor causation with scientifically reliable expert testimony that the plaintiff s exposure to the        defendant s product more than doubled the plaintiff s risk of contracting the disease.              Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Statute of limitations    Two disease rule.                   The period of limitations for an asbestos or silica action that is not barred as of May          ,     , may not accrue, nor may the running of limitations commence, prior to the earlier of        the date the exposed person               a   received a medical diagnosis of an asbestos related impairment or silica related        impairment               b   discovered facts that would have led a reasonable person to obtain a medical        diagnosis with respect to the existence of an asbestos related impairment or silica related        impairment  or              c   died having an asbestos related or silica related impairment.                  Nothing in this section may be construed to revive or extend limitations with        respect to any claim for asbestos  or silica related impairment that was otherwise time barred        as of May   ,     .                  Nothing in this section may be construed to adversely affect, impair, limit, modify,        or nullify any settlement or other agreements with respect to an asbestos or silica action entered        into before May   ,     .                  An asbestos or silica action arising out of a nonmalignant condition shall be a        distinct cause of action from an action for an asbestos related or silica related cancer.                  If otherwise permitted under state law, damages may not be awarded in an asbestos        or silica action for fear of increased risk of future disease.              Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Application.                   This part applies to asbestos and silica actions filed on or after May   ,     , as        well as any pending asbestos and silica actions in which trial has not commenced as of May   ,            .                  This part may only be applied prospectively if the application of a provision in this        part would unconstitutionally affect a vested right.
