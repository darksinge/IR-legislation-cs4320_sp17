Section           is amended to read                        .  Reemployment of a retired member of a system administered by the board.              The following laws govern the reemployment of a member of any system administered by          the board who has retired from any agency and who returns to work at that agency after retirement.           A member of any system administered by the board who has retired from any agency and who          returns to work for a private employer or at a different agency from which the member retired is          not subject to any reemployment restrictions under this section, except as provided in Subsection             .                   a   i   If a member of any system administered by the board retires from any agency          and is reemployed by the agency from which the member retired, including exempt positions, but          excluding part time or full time elected officials, the employer shall immediately notify the          administrator.               ii   If the member has full time employment and is not subject to Subsection     b , the          administrator shall cancel the member s retirement allowance and reinstate the member to active          member status.               iii   This cancellation of retirement and reinstatement to active status is effective on the          first day of the month following the date of reemployment.               iv   If a member s retirement allowance is cancelled and the member is reinstated to active          member status pursuant to this subsection, the member may not retire again with a recalculated          benefit for a two year period from the date of cancellation of the original retirement.  If the          member retires again within the two year period, the original retirement benefit shall be resumed.                      v   A reinstated member shall be credited with the service credits standing to the member s         account at the time of the first retirement and from that time shall be treated as a member of the         system in all respects, including the accrual of additional service credits but subject to         recalculation of the retirement allowance under Subsection    .              b   i   If the member is reemployed on a part time basis or is not an elected official and         is otherwise subject to Section         ,     a    ,  or          , or     a    . that member or         employee may earn, without penalty, compensation from that position or employment which is not         in excess of the exempt earnings permitted by Social Security.              ii   If a member or an employee receives compensation in a calendar year in excess of the          limitation,     of the retirement allowance shall be suspended.               iii   The effective date of a suspension and reinstatement of an allowance shall be set by          the administrator.               iv   Any suspension of a member s retirement allowance pursuant to Subsection     b  ii           shall be calculated on a calendar year basis.                   The member and employer shall maintain an accurate record of gross earnings in          employment after retirement, shall report the gross earnings on a monthly basis to the retirement          office, and shall immediately notify the administrator in writing of any postretirement earnings          under Subsection     a  and whether postretirement earnings equal or exceed the exempt earnings          under  Subsection     b .                   If a member is reinstated to active service and subsequently retires after the two year          period as provided in Subsection     a  iv , the member s retirement allowance shall be calculated          using                a   the formula in effect at the date of the member s original retirement for all service prior          to that date  and               b   the formula in effect at the date of the subsequent retirement for all service rendered          between the first and the subsequent retirement dates.                   A member who has retired  from any agency and who returns to work at that agency          or a different agency from which the member retired may not accrue any additional service credit,          except that a member who cancels the retirement allowance under Subsection     may earn          additional service credit.                   For the purposes of this section  part time  employment means employment                 contemplated as less than full time by the employer at the time of hire.
