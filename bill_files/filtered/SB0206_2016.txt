At the time an arrest is made for domestic violence  is made , the arresting officer        shall provide the alleged perpetrator with written notice containing               a   notification that the alleged perpetrator may not contact the alleged victim before        being released               b   the release conditions described in  Subsection      Subsections     through     and        notice that  those  the alleged perpetrator will not be released, before appearing before the        court with jurisdiction over the offense for which the alleged perpetrator was arrested, unless               i   the alleged perpetrator enters into a written agreement to comply with the release        conditions  or              ii   the magistrate orders the release conditions  shall be ordered by a court or shall be        agreed to by the alleged perpetrator prior to release                c   notification of the penalties for violation of any jail release court order or any        written jail release agreement executed under Subsection      and              d   notification that the alleged perpetrator is to personally appear in court on the next        day the court is open for business after the day of the arrest.                    a   If the alleged perpetrator fails to personally appear in court as scheduled, the        jail release court order or jail release agreement does not expire and continues in effect until the        alleged perpetrator makes the personal appearance in court as required by Section        . .                b   If, when the alleged perpetrator personally appears in court as required by Section               . , criminal charges have not been filed against the arrested person, the court may allow        the jail release court order or jail release agreement to expire at midnight on the day of the        court appearance or may extend it for good cause.                           In addition to the provisions of Subsections     through           , because        of the unique and highly emotional nature of domestic violence crimes, the high recidivism rate        of violent offenders, and the demonstrated increased risk of continued acts of violence        subsequent to the release of an offender who has been arrested for domestic violence, it is the        finding of the Legislature that domestic violence crimes, as defined in Section        , are        crimes for which bail may be denied if there is substantial evidence to support the charge, and        if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged perpetrator would constitute        a substantial danger to an alleged victim of domestic violence if released on bail.

In determining its sentence the court, in addition to penalties otherwise provided by        law, may require the defendant to participate in an electronic or other type of monitoring        program.                  The court may also require the defendant to pay all or part of the costs of        counseling incurred by the victim and any children affected by or exposed to the domestic        violence offense, as well as the costs for the defendant s own counseling.
