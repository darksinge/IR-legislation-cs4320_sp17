The act prohibits                          contractors and real estate brokers from offering financial incentives to a borrower to steer                          the borrower to use a specific lender for a residential mortgage loan. The act prohibits                          mortgage loan brokers from brokering or arranging for loans which would result in total                          indebtedness secured by a dwelling exceeding certain limits.  The act prohibits the financing                           of mortgage life or disability insurance as part of a residential mortgage loan and requires                           a separate disclosure to the borrower regarding mortgage life and disability insurance.  The                           act provides that a debtor may prepay the unpaid balance of a residential mortgage loan at                           any time without penalty unless certain requirements are met.  The act modifies restrictions                           on fees charged by mortgage lenders and brokers.  The act makes technical changes.
