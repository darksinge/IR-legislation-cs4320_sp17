The victim need not establish which act in a series of continuing sexual abuse       incidents caused the injury complained of, but may compute the date of discovery from the date       of discovery of the last act by the same perpetrator which is part of a common scheme or plan       of sexual abuse.                 The knowledge of a custodial parent or guardian may not be imputed to a person       under the age of    years.                 A civil action may be brought only against a living person who intentionally       perpetrated the sexual abuse or negligently permitted the sexual abuse to occur.Legislative Review Note     as of                PMOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
