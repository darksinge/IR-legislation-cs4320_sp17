prosecution barring subsequent prosecution for offense out of                             same episode                                      If a defendant has been prosecuted for one or more offenses arising out of a single                             criminal episode  a subsequent prosecution for the same or a different offense arising out of the                             same criminal episode is barred if                                   a   the subsequent prosecution is for an offense that was or should have been tried                             under Subsection                     in the former prosecution  and                                  b   the former prosecution                                   i   resulted in acquittal   or                                   ii   resulted in conviction   or                                   iii   was improperly terminated  or                                  iv   was terminated by a final order or judgment for the defendant that has not been                             reversed  set aside  or vacated and that necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a                             fact that must be established to secure conviction in the subsequent prosecution                                       There is an acquittal if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not guilty by the trier                             of facts or in a determination that there was insufficient evidence to warrant conviction   A                             finding of guilty of a lesser included offense is an acquittal of the greater offense even though                             the conviction for the lesser included offense is subsequently reversed  set aside  or vacated                                       There is a conviction if the prosecution resulted in a judgment of guilt that has not                             been reversed  set aside  or vacated  a verdict of guilty that has not been reversed  set aside  or                             vacated and that is capable of supporting a judgment  or a plea of guilty accepted by the court                                       There is an improper termination of prosecution if the termination takes place                             before the verdict  is for reasons not amounting to an acquittal  and takes place after a jury has                             been impaneled and sworn to try the defendant  or  if the jury trial is waived  after the first                             witness is sworn   However  termination of prosecution is not improper if                                   a   the defendant consents to the termination   or                                   b   the defendant waives his right to object to the termination  or                                  c   the court finds and states for the record that the termination is necessary because                                      i   it is physically impossible to proceed with the trial in conformity with the law   or                                   ii   there is a legal defect in the proceeding not attributable to the state that would make                             any judgment entered upon a verdict reversible as a matter of law   or                                   iii   prejudicial conduct in or out of the courtroom not attributable to the state makes it                             impossible to proceed with the trial without injustice to the defendant or the state   or                                   iv   the jury is unable to agree upon a verdict  or                                  v   false statements of a juror on voir dire prevent a fair trial                                  Section        Section                 is amended to read

                            of the offense charged against him is proved beyond a reasonable doubt   In the absence of                              such  this proof  the defendant shall be acquitted                                       As used in this part the words  element of the offense  mean                                   a   The conduct  attendant circumstances  or results of conduct

        The existence of jurisdiction and venue are not elements of the offense but shall be                             established by a preponderance of the evidence

of guilty or no                             contest  there is a rebuttable presumption that the conviction and commitment were regular and                             lawful in all respects if the conviction and commitment occurred after January           If the                             conviction and commitment occurred prior to January          the burden is on the prosecution

and that the defendant s plea                             was understandingly and voluntarily entered                                   e   If the trier of fact finds this section applicable  the
