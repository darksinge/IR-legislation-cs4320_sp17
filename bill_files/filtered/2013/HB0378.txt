        the person s county of residence and that specific votes on a provisional ballot that                           are for candidate races or ballot propositions for which the voter is entitled

counted                                    Except as provided in Subsection       if a voter marks more names than there are                              persons to be elected to an office  or if for any reason it is impossible to determine the choice                           of any voter for any office to be filled  the counter may not count that voter s ballot for that                           office                                     The counter shall count a defective or incomplete mark on any paper ballot if                                 a   it is in the proper place  and                                b   there is no other mark or cross on the paper ballot indicating the voter s intent to                           vote other than as indicated by the defective mark                                     a   When the voter has marked the ballot so that it appears that the voter has voted                           more than one straight ticket  the election judges may not count any votes for party candidates                                 b   The election judges shall count the remainder of the ballot if it is voted correctly                                      A counter may not reject a ballot marked by the voter because of marks on the                            ballot other than those marks allowed by this section unless the extraneous marks on a ballot or                            group of ballots show an intent by a person or group to mark their ballots so that their ballots                            can be identified                                      a   In counting the ballots  the counters shall give full consideration to the intent of                            the voter                                  b   The counters may not invalidate a ballot because of mechanical and technical                            defects in voting or failure on the part of the voter to follow strictly the rules for balloting                            required by Chapter                                        The counters may not reject a ballot because of any error in                                  a   stamping or writing any official endorsement  or                                 b   delivering the wrong ballots to any polling place                                      The counter may not count any paper ballot that does not have the official                            endorsement by an election officer                                      The counter may not count any ballot proposition vote or candidate vote for which                           the voter is not  legally entitled to vote  as used in Section       A                                                       If the counter discovers that the name of a candidate voted for is misspelled                            or that the initial letters of a candidate s given name are transposed or omitted in part or                            altogether  the counter shall count the voter s vote for that candidate if it is apparent that the                            voter intended to vote for that candidate                                              The counter shall count a vote for the president and the vice president of                               any political party as a vote for the presidential electors selected by the political party                                              In counting the valid write in votes  if  by casting a valid write in vote  a                            voter has cast more votes for an office than that voter is entitled to vote for that office  the                            judges shall count the valid write in vote as being the obvious intent of the voter                                 Section       Section      A           is amended to read                                    A         Review and disposition of provisional ballot envelopes                                      As used in this section  a person is  legally entitled to vote  if                                  a   the person                                  i   is registered to vote in the state                                  ii   votes the ballot for the voting

failed to provide valid voter identification or the documents provided as                            valid voter identification were inadequate and the poll worker recorded that fact in the official                            register but the county clerk verifies the person s identity and residence through some other                            means  and                                 iii   did

person s identity and residence through some other                            means as reliable as photo identification  or                                 B   the person provides valid voter identification to the county clerk or an election                            officer who is administering the election by the close of normal office hours on Monday after
