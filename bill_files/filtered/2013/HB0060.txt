sought a permit  authorization  approval  exception                            or waiver with respect to a facility sufficiently in advance of the date construction should                           commence  based upon reasonably foreseeable conditions  to allow the local government                           reasonable time to pay for any estimated excess cost                                 iv

to recover from its ratepayers any actual                           excess costs apportioned to it under Subsection     b  iv                                      If the board determines that a facility that a local government has prohibited should                           be constructed  the written decision shall specify any general location parameters required to                           provide safe  reliable  adequate  and efficient service to the customers of the public utility                                      The written decision shall leave to the local government any issue that does not                            affect the provision of safe  reliable  adequate  and efficient service to customers of the public                            utility or that does not involve an estimated excess cost                                      With respect to local government requirements or conditions that impose an                            estimated excess cost but do not impair the provision of safe  reliable  and adequate service to                            the customers of the public utility  the written decision shall leave each siting issue to the local                            government except determination of the estimated excess cost and determination of when the                            construction of the facility should commence                                      a   In determining when the construction of the facility should commence  the                            board shall consider whether the public utility sought a permit  authorization  approval                             exception  or waiver from the local government in a timely manner based upon reasonably                            foreseeable conditions   and  if                                   b   If the board determines that the public utility did not  do so  it  seek a permit                            authorization  approval  exception  or waiver in a timely manner  the board shall allow                            sufficient time for the local government to pay any actual excess cost that may be imposed as a                            result of requirements or conditions the local government has imposed that do not impair the                            provision of safe  reliable  and adequate service to customers of the public utility                                  c   There is a presumption that the utility has sought a permit  authorization  approval                            exception  or waiver in a timely manner if the utility has complied with                                  i   the notice and filing requirements of Chapter     Siting of High Voltage Power Line                           Act  or                                    ii   the timing requirements imposed by a local government land use ordinance                                 Section       Section                  is amended to read
