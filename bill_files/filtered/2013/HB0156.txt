                 Section       Section      A             is enacted to read                                  A           Statement of parental liberty interests                                     The severance and termination of family ties by the state is a step of the utmost                          gravity  which may only be done for the most compelling reasons                                     It is generally in the best interest and welfare of a child to be reared under the care                          of the child s natural parents                                     Termination of parental rights cannot be decreed without giving full and serious                          consideration to the prior and fundamental right of a parent to rear the parent s child and                           concomitantly  of the right of the child to be reared by the child s natural parent                                     A parent has a fundamental right protected by the U S  Constitution to sustain the                          parent s relationship with the parent s child                                     a   Recognition of due process and retained rights of parents promotes values                          essential to the preservation of human freedom and dignity and the perpetuation of our                          democratic society                                 b   Any invasion of the sanctity of the family  even with the loftiest of motives                           unavoidably threatens the values described in Subsection     a                                      No court shall  but for the gravest of reasons  transfer a child from the child s                             natural parent to any other person  since the right of a parent under natural law to establish a                          home and bring up children is fundamental and beyond the reach of any court                                     Where there is still reason to believe that positive  nurturing parent child                          relationships can exist  including extended family association and support  the interest of the                          state favors preservation  not severance  of natural familial bonds                                Section       Section      A             is enacted to read                                  A           Contesting a petition to terminate

parental rights under Section                               A           and disputes that the parent s parental rights should be terminated  may                                 a   contest the

parent s rights are ultimately terminated                                     The division shall make a recommendation to the court regarding the fitness of the                          nominee described in Subsection     to serve as the child s guardian                                     The court shall                                 a   consider                                 i   the

who shall raise and care for the parent s                          child  and                                v   the fundamental right of a child to be reared by the child s parent or the parent s

parental rights  order a legal guardianship relationship between the child and the                          nominee  if it is in the best interest of the child and a means of achieving the strong public                          policy in support of family preservation                                     In an order granting the petition for guardianship  the court shall describe                                 a   what limitations  if any  the guardian shall place on the parent s access to the child                          as a condition for continued guardianship  and

months after the                          day on which the guardianship petition is granted to review whether guardianship is still                          appropriate and consistent with controlling constitutional rights                                      Nothing in this section shall be construed as a guarantee that a nominee will be                           allowed to serve as a legal guardian for a child  but the nominee shall be given added weight                           and strong and thorough consideration                                      Legal guardianship  as described and established in this section  is                                  a   considered a permanent placement for purposes of complying with federal law  if                           the guardianship is
