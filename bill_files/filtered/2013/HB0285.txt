Utah                                Section       Section      A           is amended to read                                   A          Legislative findings on teacher quality    Declaration of education as                           a profession    Annual report                                     a   The Legislature acknowledges that education is perhaps the most important                           function of state and local governments  recognizing that the future success of our state and                           nation depend in large part upon the existence of a responsible and educated citizenry                                 b   The Legislature further acknowledges that the primary responsibility for the                           education of children within the state resides with their parents or guardians and that the role of                           state and local governments is to support and assist parents in fulfilling that responsibility                                     a   The Legislature finds that                                 i   quality teaching is the basic building block of successful schools and  outside of                           home and family circumstances  the essential component of student achievement                                 ii   the high quality of teachers is absolutely essential to enhance student achievement                           and to assure educational excellence in each classroom in the state s public schools  and                                iii   the implementation of a comprehensive continuum of data driven strategies                           regarding recruitment  preservice  licensure  induction  professional development  and                           evaluation is essential if the state and its citizens expect every classroom to be staffed by a                           skilled  caring  and effective teacher                                 b   In providing for the safe and effective performance of the function of educating                           Utah s children  the Legislature further finds it to be of critical importance that education                            including instruction  administrative  and supervisory services  be recognized as a profession                            and that those who are licensed or seek to become licensed and to serve as educators                                 i   meet high standards both as to qualifications and fitness for service as educators                           through quality recruitment and preservice programs before assuming their responsibilities in                           the schools                                 ii   maintain those standards in the performance of their duties while holding licenses                            in large part through participating in induction and ongoing professional development                           programs focused on instructional improvement                                    iii   receive fair  systematic evaluations of their performance at school for the purpose                           of enhancing the quality of public education and student achievement  and                                iv   have access to a process for fair examination and review of allegations made                           against them and for the administration of appropriate sanctions against those found  in                           accordance with due process  to have failed to conduct themselves in a manner commensurate                           with their authority and responsibility to provide appropriate professional services to the                           children of the state                                      The State Board of Education and the State
