offense involving the use of a dangerous weapon                            which also would have been a felony if committed by an adult                                     All proceedings before the

        a   If the information alleges the violation of a felony listed in Subsection      the                           state shall have the burden of going forward with its case and the burden of proof to establish                           probable cause to believe that one of the crimes listed in Subsection     has been committed                           and that the defendant committed it   If proceeding under Subsection     b   the state shall have                           the additional burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has                           previously been adjudicated or convicted of an offense involving the use of a dangerous                           weapon                                 b   If the juvenile court judge finds the state has met its burden under this Subsection                                the court shall order that the defendant be bound over and held to answer in the district                           court in the same manner as an adult unless the juvenile court judge finds that  all of the                          following conditions exist   it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor and to the                          public to bind over the defendant to the jurisdiction of the district court                                    c   In making the bind over determination in Subsection     b   the judge shall consider                          only the following                                 i   whether the minor has  not  been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense                           involving the use of a dangerous weapon which would be a felony if committed by an adult                                 ii    that  if the offense was committed with one or more other persons  whether the                           minor appears to have a greater or lesser degree of culpability than the codefendants   and                                 iii    that  the extent to which the minor s role in the offense was  not  committed in a                           violent  aggressive  or premeditated manner                                    iv   the number and nature of the minor s prior adjudications in the juvenile court  and                                v   whether public safety is better served by adjudicating the minor in the juvenile                          court or in the district court                                  c    d   Once the state has met its burden under  this  Subsection     a  as to a                           showing of probable cause  the defendant shall have the burden of going forward and                           presenting evidence  as to the existence of the above conditions  that in light of the                          considerations listed in Subsection     c   it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor                          and the best interests of the public to bind the defendant over to the jurisdiction of the district                          court                                  d    e   If the juvenile court judge finds by clear and convincing evidence that  all the                          above conditions are satisfied   it would be contrary to the best interest of the minor and the                          best interests of the public to bind the defendant over to the jurisdiction of the district court  the                           court shall so state in its findings and order the minor held for trial as a minor and shall proceed                           upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition                                     If the juvenile court judge finds that an offense has been committed  but that the                           state has not met its burden of proving the other criteria needed to bind the defendant over                           under Subsection      the juvenile court judge shall order the defendant held for trial as a minor                           and shall proceed upon the information as though it were a juvenile petition                                     At the time of a bind over to district court a criminal warrant of arrest shall issue                             The defendant shall have the same right to bail as any other criminal defendant and shall be                           advised of that right by the juvenile court judge   The juvenile court shall set initial bail in                           accordance with Title     Chapter     Bail                                     If an indictment is returned by a grand jury charging a violation under this section                               the preliminary examination held by the juvenile court judge need not include a finding of                           probable cause that the crime alleged in the indictment was committed and that the defendant                           committed it  but the juvenile court shall proceed in accordance with this section regarding the                           additional considerations listed in Subsection     b                                      When a defendant is charged with multiple criminal offenses in the same                           information or indictment and is bound over to answer in the district court for one or more                           charges under this section  other offenses arising from the same criminal episode and any                           subsequent misdemeanors or felonies charged against him shall be considered together with                           those charges  and where the court finds probable cause to believe that those crimes have been                           committed and that the defendant committed them  the defendant shall also be bound over to                            the district court to answer for those charges                                      When a minor has been bound over to the district court under this section  the                            jurisdiction of the Division of Juvenile Justice Services and the juvenile court over the minor is                            terminated regarding that offense
