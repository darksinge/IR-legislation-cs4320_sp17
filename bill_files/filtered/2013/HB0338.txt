     If a petition alleges noncompliance with a parent time order by a parent  or a                           visitation order by a grandparent or other member of the immediate family where a

                           vi   whether the recipient spouse worked in a business owned or operated by the payor                           spouse  and                                vii   whether the recipient spouse directly contributed to any increase in the payor                              spouse s skill by paying for education received by the payor spouse or  allowing  enabling the                           payor spouse to attend school during the marriage                                 b   The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining whether to award                           alimony and the terms thereof                                 c    Fault  means wrongful conduct during the marriage that substantially contributed                          to the breakup of the marriage relationship  including                                 i   engaging in sexual relations with a person other than the party s spouse                                 ii   knowingly and intentionally causing or attempting to cause physical harm to the                          other party or minor children                                 iii   knowingly and intentionally causing the other party or minor children to                           reasonably fear life threatening harm  or                                 iv   substantially undermining the financial stability of the other party or the minor                           children                                  d   The court may  when fault is at issue  close the proceedings and seal the court                           records                                   c    e   As a general rule  the court should look to the standard of living  existing at                            the time of separation  in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection     a    However                             the court shall consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may  in its discretion                             base alimony on the standard of living that existed at the time of trial   In marriages of short                            duration  when no children have been conceived or born during the marriage  the court may                            consider the standard of living that existed at the time of the marriage                                   d    f   The court may  under appropriate circumstances  attempt to equalize the                            parties  respective standards of living                                   e    g   When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major                            change in the income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both  that change                            shall be considered in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony                              If one spouse s earning capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses                            during the marriage  the court may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital                            property and awarding alimony                                   f    h   In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves  and no                            children have been conceived or born during the marriage  the court may consider restoring                               each party to the condition which existed at the time of the marriage                                   g    i   i   The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new                            orders regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not                            foreseeable at the time of the divorce                                  ii   The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address                            needs of the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered  unless the court                            finds extenuating circumstances that justify that action                                  iii   In determining alimony  the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not                            be considered  except as provided in this Subsection                                      A   The court may consider the subsequent spouse s financial ability to share living                            expenses                                  B   The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that                            the payor s improper conduct justifies that consideration                                   h    j   Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years                            that the marriage existed unless  at any time prior to termination of alimony  the court finds                            extenuating circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time                                      Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise  any order of the court                            that a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage or                            death of that former spouse   However  if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void ab                            initio  payment of alimony shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the                            action of annulment and  his  the payor party s rights are determined                                       Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates                            upon establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with                            another person       Legislative Review Note      as of                 PM   Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel
