Reclamation Act  which allowed Western water projects to be engineered and financed with                            federal money  allowing the Western States to grow much faster than if water projects had been                            left to private and state financing                                 WHEREAS  Sutherland chose not to run for a second term and resumed his practice

Sutherland prevailed in an interparty fight with incumbent Thomas Kearns                                 WHEREAS  Sutherland s two term Senate career was stellar                                 WHEREAS  through his legal ability  affability  and hard work  Sutherland                            accomplished much regarding women s suffrage  workers  compensation  reclamation  Indian                            affairs  and foreign policy                                 WHEREAS  Sutherland was the driving force behind the Federal Employer Liability                            Act  which created a workers  compensation system                                 WHEREAS  in support of the new system  Sutherland argued   When we are able to get                            to the truth as to how these accidents happen we will be able to apply the remedy with greater                            certainty  so that the law is not only just in providing compensation to all injured employees                             one of the legitimate expenses of the industry  but what is perhaps still more important  it will                            tend to greatly reduce the number of accidents and consequently the aggregate of human                            suffering                                  WHEREAS  Sutherland championed many other labor causes  earning him the praise of                            Samuel Gompers  President of the American Federation of Labor                                 WHEREAS  Sutherland s Judiciary Committee rewrote the United States Criminal and                            Judicial codes   a monumental task  according to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the                            United States Supreme Court                                 WHEREAS  in       Sutherland s courtroom skills were well displayed in the Senate                            where he mounted a detailed and successful defense of Senator Reed Smoot when the Senate                            considered expelling Smoot due to his religious and alleged polygamous practices                                 WHEREAS  Sutherland sponsored the Nineteenth Amendment to give women the right                            to vote in      and exerted every effort to assure its passage                                    WHEREAS  Sutherland gave several well received speeches promoting the                            amendment  including a      speech in which he stated   I give my assent to woman suffrage                            because  as the matter appeals to me  there is no justification for denying to half our citizens the                            right to participate in the operations of a government which is as much their government as it is                            ours upon the sole ground that they happen to be born women instead of men                                  WHEREAS  Sutherland was not a pacifist  and contended that security should be won                            through vigilance and strength                                 WHEREAS  when Germany s new submarine fleet attacked shipping in the open sea                             President Wilson s apparent vacillation in      gave rise to sharp criticism from Sutherland in                            the Senate  where he stated    my own view of the matter is that the new weapon  the                            submarine  must yield to the law not that the law must yield to the new weapon I for one am                            becoming sick and tired of the spineless policy of retreat and scuttle Instead of warning our                            own people to exercise their rights at their peril I would like to see issued to other people a                            warning to interfere with these rights at their peril   The danger of it all is that by this policy of                            always backing down  instead of backing up  we shall encourage an increased encroachment                            upon our rights until we shall finally be driven into crises from which nothing but war can                            extricate us                                  WHEREAS  during his Senate years  Sutherland was frequently engaged as a speaker                            on many public issues and he gained a strong reputation as a constitutional scholar                                 WHEREAS  this reputation was enhanced by the fact that he argued three cases before                            the United States Supreme Court while serving in the Senate                                 WHEREAS  in       Sutherland supported the Seventeenth Amendment  which                            provided for popular election of United States Senators                                 WHEREAS  in       Sutherland ran for a third term against his old law partner and                            friend  William King  and lost                                 WHEREAS  although Sutherland had not run a statewide campaign for    years  his                            loss was likely due to the coattail effect of the antiwar fervor that propelled President Wilson to                            a second term  on the mantra that  He kept us out of war                                  WHEREAS  many Republican candidates were badly defeated in       but in his                            consoling words to William Howard Taft on his loss of the presidential race  Sutherland stated                              We are to pass through a period of readjustment  and the present administration  in view of its                               past history  is not likely to deal with the serious problems which will arise in such a way as to                            satisfy the country   The result will be  therefore  that we shall come back into power for a long                            time                                  WHEREAS  the Republicans won the next three presidential elections                                 WHEREAS  after leaving the Senate  Sutherland practiced law in Washington  D C                             and argued four cases before the United States Supreme Court                                 WHEREAS  in       Sutherland was elected President of the American Bar                            Association and gave a series of six lectures at Columbia University Law School on the                            Constitution and foreign affairs                                 WHEREAS  always a keen political strategist  Sutherland supported Warren G                             Harding s seemingly unlikely but successful bid for the Republican presidential nomination                             and after Harding was elected he appointed Sutherland as lead counsel for the United States in                            a seven week trial at The Hague                                 WHEREAS  Sutherland was also counsel to the United States Delegation to the                            Armament talks of                                      WHEREAS  on September          President Harding nominated Sutherland for an                            open seat on the United States Supreme Court and the Senate unanimously confirmed him the                            same day                                 WHEREAS  there was great public interest in and support for Sutherland s appointment                            because he was the first Utahn to be appointed  one of the few Senators to ascend to the bench                             only the fourth foreign born Justice to serve on the Court  and the first to do so since                                      WHEREAS  as he had throughout every aspect of his life  Justice Sutherland worked                            very hard on the United States Supreme Court                                 WHEREAS  in    years he wrote     majority opinions     dissents  and                              concurrence  an average of    majority opinions per year  which is double the average                            production of today s Supreme Court Justices                                 WHEREAS  Justice Sutherland s broad life experiences  sobriety  hard work  and                            self reliance brought a valuable perspective to the Court                                 WHEREAS  Justice Sutherland s impoverished upbringing and boyhood years filled                            with extremely hard work  combined with his intellect and ambition  propelled him into the                            highest echelon of power on the state and national levels  exposing him to people from all                               walks of life                                 WHEREAS  Justice Sutherland s extensive experience in the state and national                            legislative branches gave him a solid foundation as a constitutional scholar and an expert in                            governmental affairs                                 WHEREAS  having seen temporary factions spring to life from time to time  claiming                            to have all the answers to society s challenges only to fade away and leave in their wake                            ill considered legislation that often infringed on individual rights or violated other                            constitutional principles  Justice Sutherland was wary of the tyranny of the majority                                 WHEREAS  Justice Sutherland challenged the Congress  the President  and other                            courts in order to protect individual rights or fundamental constitutional doctrines                                 WHEREAS  in       in Berger v  United States  wherein an Assistant U S  Attorney                            was guilty of gross misconduct during a criminal trial  Justice Sutherland eloquently set the                            standard for prosecutorial misconduct when he wrote that the misconduct called for a stern                            rebuke and repressive measures  stating   The United States Attorney is the representative not                            of an ordinary party to a controversy  but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern                            impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all  and whose interest  therefore  in a                            criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case  but that justice shall be done   As such  he is                            in peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law  the twofold name of which is that                            guilt shall not escape  or innocents suffer   He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor                             indeed he should do so   But  while he may strike hard blows  he is not at liberty to strike foul                            ones   It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful                            conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one                                  WHEREAS  this decision better clarified the prosecutor s role and obligations and gave                            trial judges a clear directive and authority to punish prosecutorial misconduct                                 WHEREAS  when Franklin D  Roosevelt overwhelmingly defeated President Hoover in                                  the Congress quickly passed many acts to address the economic calamity  but the laws                            were not thoroughly assessed from a constitutional point of view before they were passed                                 WHEREAS  this led to scores of court challenges  and many laws were struck down by                            unanimous vote in             and       while others were struck down by close votes on                            various constitutional grounds                                 WHEREAS  the most controversial opinions that Justice Sutherland wrote struck down                               portions of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt s New Deal legislation                                 WHEREAS  after his landslide      reelection  Roosevelt proposed adding six Justices                            to the United States Supreme Court  which Justice Sutherland saw as a roadblock to economic                            recovery                                 WHEREAS  the political upheaval that the court packing plan sparked caused                            conservative Justice Owen Roberts to change his votes and to uphold the New Deal legislation                                 WHEREAS  this switch of a vote and strong public opposition to court packing led to                            its defeat in the Senate and avoided a constitutional  and perhaps a national  crisis                                 WHEREAS  Justice Sutherland was bitterly disappointed with Justice Roberts s vote                            change  and when the Supreme Court then reversed recent Supreme Court decisions                             Sutherland dissented sharply  contending that political expediency had trumped constitutional                            principles                                 WHEREAS  much to the disappointment of moderates and conservatives  Justice                            Sutherland retired in                                      WHEREAS  humble to the end  Sutherland did not mention the Supreme Court or his                            career in his last public address  the Convocation of the BYU Class of       but instead                            reminisced about Utah in the     s and   s  his daylong labors as a child  and his education at                            his beloved Brigham Young Academy                                 WHEREAS  above all he implored graduates to be vigilant caretakers of their character                             then to focus on career  family  and church                                 WHEREAS  George Sutherland passed away in                                      WHEREAS  this nation s heritage and good sense teach us to honor distinguished and                            exemplary forefathers  and                                WHEREAS  other public servants may deserve the recognition of having their names                            on the new federal courthouse  but none deserves it more than George Sutherland                                 NOW  THEREFORE  BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah urge                            the members of Utah s congressional delegation to work to have the new federal courthouse in                            Salt Lake City named after Justice George Sutherland                                 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature urge the members of Utah s                            congressional delegation to make this effort in recognition of Justice Sutherland s lifetime of                            service to the citizens of the state of Utah as a member of the Utah Senate and to the United                               States as a member of the United States House of Representatives  a

public service is unsurpassed                                 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the members of                            Utah s congressional delegation
