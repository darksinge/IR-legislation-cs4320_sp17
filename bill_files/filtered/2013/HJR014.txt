ON WATER RIGHTS                                 GENERAL SESSION                          STATE OF UTAH                             Chief Sponsor  Ken Ivory                                Senate Sponsor           Evan J  Vickers                                                         LONG TITLE                          General Description                               This joint resolution of the Legislature declares that claims of the United States Forest                           Service on state waters originating on public lands undermine state sovereignty and                           demand action by the state of Utah to protect its sovereign  recognized ownership and                           rights  and calls on state  county  and local governments to protect  preserve  and defend                           the health  safety  and welfare of the citizens of the state of Utah by defending and                           maintaining jurisdiction over the water resources of this state                            Highlighted Provisions                                This resolution                                     affirms the rights established in the Utah Constitution related to citizens  water                           rights and Utah s sovereign ownership and control over its water                                     declares that the actions related to claims of the United States Forest Service on                           state waters originating on public lands undermine state sovereignty  and demand                           action by the state of Utah to protect its sovereign  recognized ownership and rights                           on behalf of the citizens of Utah  and                                    calls on state  county  and local governments to protect  preserve  and defend their                           jurisdictional and constitutional obligation to protect the health  safety  and welfare                           of the citizens of the state of Utah  particularly in defending and maintaining                           jurisdiction over the water resources of this state                            Special Clauses                                   None                                                    Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah                                WHEREAS  water is essential to life  health  safety  and welfare  especially in Utah and                           throughout the West                                WHEREAS  in its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act decision released June                                     the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that jurisdiction over matters that                            concern the lives  liberties  and properties of the people  are  possessed by the States but not                           the Federal Government                                 WHEREAS  in the exercise of its jurisdiction over water resources within the state  the                           state of Utah has long established the recognition of water rights to  first in time  users of the                           water who can demonstrate the ability to put the water to  beneficial use                                 WHEREAS  in short   beneficial use  means water use that includes domestic use                            irrigation  stock watering  manufacturing  mining  hydropower  municipal use  aquaculture                            recreation  and fish and wildlife  among others                                WHEREAS  in disregard for and disrespect of the long established state jurisdiction                           over water resources  the federal government  principally by and through the United States                           Forest Service  USFS   has engaged in a persistent pattern and course of conduct to exert                           control and influence over water resources within the state and throughout the West                                WHEREAS  various federal agencies are acting to negatively impact the water                           resources of Utah and other western states by unilaterally and substantially reducing the                           number of grazing permits and severely restricting timber harvesting                                WHEREAS  these federal policies which overly restrict timber harvesting and grazing                            build up dangerous wildfire fuel loads and result in inordinate water absorption for unhealthy                           vegetation densities                                WHEREAS  these federal agencies are also threatening to not renew often long held                           grazing permits unless the permittee signs a water right change application over to the federal                           agency  closing roads and access to water resources  diminishing water recreation                           opportunities  and imposing onerous permit requirements                                WHEREAS  some specific examples of the disregard for and disrespect of state                           jurisdiction over water resources by federal agencies include                                       In the spring of       agents of the USFS coerced Tooele County livestock                           producers to sign change applications on private livestock water rights under compulsion of                           prohibiting the livestock producers from turning out their cattle onto their Forest Service                           allotment if the producers did not comply with the federal agency demand                                    Near Scipio  the USFS based its diligence claim filings on use by nineteenth century                           settlers and then used the filings  and the threat of protracted litigation  to dispossess direct                           descendants of the settlers from their legitimate water rights                                    For many years  the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land                           Management actively sought to reduce or eliminate the livestock and watering rights of a                           Nevada rancher   This action resulted in protracted litigation before United States District                           Court Judge Robert C  Jones  which concluded in the      criminal convictions of two public                           servants employed by the USFS and the Bureau of Land Management   Both public servants                           were found guilty of contempt of court and witness intimidation charges   At trial  the regional                           forester in charge of Utah was found to have lied to the court when asked about the agency s                           antigrazing plan  which sought to eliminate cattle grazing on public lands                                    From      to the present  federal agents have barred city of Tombstone officials                           from accessing their water resources established in the Huachuca Mountains as early as                                 which were washed out by monsoon rains on the heels of devastating wildfires exacerbated by                           unmitigated fuel loads   Local officials were at first denied access to repair their water lines  but                           were then allowed by USFS agents to only use  horses and hand tools  to ascend the mountain                           on foot in an obviously futile attempt to restore their water services   In attempting to ascend                           the road they had used for decades to repair their water resources with modern machinery                            Tombstone officials were met by armed Forest Service agents and turned back at the threat of                           arrest and confiscation of expensive  rented heavy machinery   The city of Tombstone is now                           engaged in protracted litigation with the federal government over its water resources and has                           been reduced to using arsenic laced wells that lack the pressure and capacity to withstand any                           serious fire danger to the wooden town in the middle of a desert in the middle of a drought                                    The United States Forest Service filed suit in Idaho against the Joyce Livestock                           Company  arguing the livestock water rights were the property of the United States  based on                           federal ownership and control of the public lands coupled with the Bureau of Land                           Management s oversight of the public lands under the Taylor Grazing Act   Through protracted                              litigation  the Joyce Livestock Company proved its water rights to have been in place since                                  The district court found no evidence that the United States had appropriated any water                           by grazing livestock   Upon appeal  in Joyce Livestock Company vs  United States  the Idaho                           Supreme Court unanimously held that the United States did not actually apply the water to                           beneficial use under the constitutional method of appropriation and  therefore  had no water                           right                                    USFS efforts to exert control over the water rights of Colorado s ski industry were                           recently delayed on procedural grounds in a lawsuit brought by the ski industry   The USFS                            through a new policy clause in the land use permitting process  seeks to require ski industry                           interests to provide joint ownership of state water rights  relinquish water rights held jointly                            with the federal government if the use permit is terminated  and grant  limited  power of                            attorney to the United States to execute documents pertaining to jointly held water rights with                            the promise that the ski industry will waive any claim against the United States for                            compensation of water rights lost as a result of the new permit language                                 WHEREAS  John Dickinson  one of the Founding Fathers of this nation  warned   It                            will be their own faults  if the several states suffer the federal sovereignty to interfere in the                            things of their respective jurisdictions                                  WHEREAS  the United States Supreme Court also highlighted a vital role of states                             authority in relation to protecting the liberty and property of their citizens by curbing federal                            government overreach  stating   The Independent power of the States also serves as a check on                            the power of the Federal Government   By denying any one government complete jurisdiction                            over all the concerns of public life  federalism protects the liberty of the individual from                            arbitrary power                                   WHEREAS  in its recent Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act decision  the                            United States Supreme Court further admonished states of their jurisdiction to protect matters                            of health  safety  and welfare  such as the critical life sustaining issue of water in the West                             stating   Our cases refer to this general power of governing  possessed by the States but not by                            the Federal Government  as the  police power              Because the police power is controlled by                               different states instead of one national sovereign  the facets of governing that touch on                            citizens  daily lives are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed                              The Framers thus ensured that powers which  in the ordinary course of affairs  concern the                               lives  liberties  and properties of the people  were held by governments more local and more                            accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy                                  WHEREAS  after recounting these fundamental principles and the states  inherent                            powers as  separate and independent sovereigns   the United States Supreme Court                            admonished   In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives by adopting                             the simple expedient of not yielding  to federal blandishments when they do not want to                            embrace the federal policies as their own   The States are separate and independent sovereigns                              Sometimes they have to act like it                                  WHEREAS  the USFS Intermountain Region Guidance Document states that the                            federal government will not invest in livestock water improvements   nor   according to the                            Intermountain Region Director   will the agency authorize water improvements to be                            constructed or reconstructed with private funds where the right is held solely by the livestock                            owner                                  WHEREAS  when the USFS allows improvements  including developing                             redeveloping  and maintaining a livestock permittee s water rights  all improvements are                            claimed as the property of the United States  even when the investments are made by individual                            livestock permittees to allow the permittees to put their livestock watering rights to beneficial                            use as prescribed under state law                                 WHEREAS  the USFS has used pressure tactics to gain control of livestock water rights                            by seeking change applications from the permittees or joint ownership in water with the federal                            agency                                 WHEREAS  the USFS has threatened to not allow livestock permittees onto its Forest                            Service grazing allotments until permittees comply with the request                                 WHEREAS  pre existing water rights for livestock permittees on federal lands are                            protected in both the      Taylor Grazing Act and the      Federal Land Policy and                            Management Act                                 WHEREAS  these actions by federal agencies infringe on recognized state jurisdiction                            and sovereignty  state law  and water rights established through historic livestock watering on                            public lands  and Utah s beneficial use doctrine                                 WHEREAS  it is the apparent intention of the federal government to further expand its                            water holdings in the West  including Utah  through the USFS as provided in    U S C  Sec                                     which states   There are authorized to be appropriated for expenditure by the Forest                            Service such sums as may be necessary for the investigation and establishment of water rights                             including the purchase thereof or of lands or interests in lands or rights of way for use and                            protection of water rights necessary or beneficial in connection with the administration and                            public use of the national forests                                  WHEREAS  the United States  by and through its various agencies and departments                             appears intent upon undermining  or at the very least disregarding  state sovereignty and                            jurisdiction over water rights and resources  as outlined in the USFS Intermountain Region                            Guidance Document  which states   until the court issues a decree accepting these claims  it is                            not known whether these claims will be recognized as water rights                                  WHEREAS  in seeking to expand the federal government s interest in the Utah water                            rights portfolio and exert greater control over the natural resources of the state  the USFS has                            filed more than        water rights claims of ownership on livestock watering rights located                            across the state                                 WHEREAS  water rights claimed by the United States  based on its control of public                            lands  coupled with the Bureau of Land Management s comprehensive management of public                            lands under the Taylor Grazing Act  do not constitute the application of the water right to                            beneficial use under Utah s constitutional method of water appropriation and beneficial use                                 WHEREAS  these waters are the property of the citizens of the state of Utah under its                            constitution  and the control falls under the stewardship and jurisdiction of the Utah State                            Legislature                                 WHEREAS  it is recognized and understood that the United States cannot obtain                            sovereign water rights  nor can it obtain historic livestock water rights established on public                            lands  through federal laws                                 WHEREAS  the consequence of allowing the federal government to exceed its                            authority over water rights is clearly illustrated by the great difficulty in getting the federal                            government to
