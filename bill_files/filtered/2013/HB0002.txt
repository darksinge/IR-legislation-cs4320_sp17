on or after January          a school district may receive state support in                           accordance with Subsection     without complying with the requirements of Subsection     b                            if the local school board imposed a tax in accordance with this section during the taxable year                           beginning on January         and ending on December                                              a   In addition to the revenue a school district collects from the imposition of a levy                           pursuant to this section  the state shall contribute an amount sufficient to guarantee        per                           weighted pupil unit for each       of the first       per dollar of taxable value                                 b   The same dollar amount guarantee per weighted pupil unit for the       per dollar                           of taxable value under Subsection     a  shall apply to the portion of the board local levy                           authorized in Section       A   a          so that the guarantee shall apply up to a total of      per                           dollar of taxable value if a school district levies a tax rate under both programs                                 c   i   Beginning July                 the        guarantee under Subsections     a                            and  b  shall be indexed each year to the value of the weighted pupil unit for the grades                             through    program by making the value of the guarantee equal to                  times the                           value of the prior year s weighted pupil unit for the grades   through    program                                 ii   The guarantee shall increase by       times the value of the

increase in the guarantee                                 d   i   The amount of state guarantee money to which a school district would otherwise                           be entitled to receive under this Subsection     may not be reduced for the sole reason that the                           district s levy is reduced as a consequence of changes in the certified tax rate under Section                                         pursuant to changes in property valuation                                 ii   Subsection     d  i  applies for a period of five years following any such change in                           the certified tax rate                                 e   The guarantee provided under this section does not apply to the portion of a voted                           local levy rate that exceeds the voted local levy rate that was in effect for the previous fiscal                           year  unless an increase in the voted local levy rate was authorized in an election conducted on                           or after July   of the previous fiscal year and before December   of the previous fiscal year                                     a   An election to modify an existing voted local levy is not a reconsideration of the                           existing authority unless the proposition submitted to the electors expressly so states                                    b   A majority vote opposing a modification does not deprive the district of authority to                           continue the levy                                 c   If adoption of a voted local levy is contingent upon an offset reducing other local                           school board levies  the board must allow the electors  in an election  to consider modifying or                           discontinuing the imposition of the levy prior to a subsequent increase in other levies that                           would increase the total local school board levy                                 d   Nothing contained in this section terminates  without an election  the authority of a                           school district to continue imposing an existing voted local levy previously authorized by the                           voters as a voted leeway program                                     Notwithstanding Section                   a school district may budget an increased                            amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from a voted local levy imposed under this                            section in addition to revenue from new growth as defined in Subsection                      without                            having to comply with the notice requirements of Section                   if                                  a   the voted local levy is approved                                  i   in accordance with Subsections     and     on or after January          and                                 ii   within the four year period immediately preceding the year in which the school                            district seeks to budget an increased amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from                            the voted local levy  and                                 b   for a voted local levy approved or modified in accordance with this section on or                            after January          the school district complies with the requirements of Subsection                                          Notwithstanding Section                   a school district may levy a tax rate under this                            section that exceeds the certified tax rate without having to comply with the notice                            requirements of Section                  if                                  a   the levy exceeds the certified tax rate as the result of a school district budgeting an                            increased amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from a voted local levy imposed                            under this section                                  b   the voted local levy was approved                                  i   in accordance with Subsections     and     on or after January          and                                 ii   within the four year period immediately preceding the year in which the school                            district seeks to budget an increased amount of ad valorem property tax revenue derived from                            the voted local levy  and                                    c   for a voted local levy approved or modified in accordance with this section on or                            after January          the school district complies with requirements of Subsection
