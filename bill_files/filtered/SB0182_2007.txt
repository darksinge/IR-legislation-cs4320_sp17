If a child support order has not been issued, adjusted, or modified within the previous                          three years and the children who are the subject of the order currently receive TANF funds, the                          office shall review the order, and if appropriate, move the tribunal to adjust the amount of the                          order if there is a difference of     or more between the payor s ordered support amount and                          the payor s support amount required under the guidelines.                               Section  .    Section           .      is amended to read                                        . .  Application of guidelines    Rebuttal.                                    The guidelines apply to any judicial or administrative order establishing or                           modifying an award of child support entered on or after July  ,     .                                    a   The child support guidelines shall be applied as a rebuttable presumption in                           establishing or modifying the amount of temporary or permanent child support.                                b   The rebuttable presumption means the provisions and considerations required by                           the guidelines, the award amounts resulting from the application of the guidelines, and the use                           of worksheets consistent with these guidelines are presumed to be correct, unless rebutted                           under the provisions of this section.                                    A written finding or specific finding on the record supporting the conclusion that                           complying with a provision of the guidelines or ordering an award amount resulting from use                           of the guidelines would be unjust, inappropriate, or not in the best interest of a child in a                           particular case is sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case.  If an order rebuts the                           presumption through findings, it is considered a deviated order.                                    The following shall be considered deviations from the guidelines, if                                 a   the order includes a written finding that it is a nonguidelines order                                 b   the guidelines worksheet has the box checked for a deviation and has an                           explanation as to the reason  or                                c   the deviation was made because there were more children than provided for in the                              guidelines table.                                    If the amount in the order and the amount on the guidelines worksheet differ, but                           the difference is less than    , the order shall not be considered deviated and the incomes listed                           on the worksheet may be used in adjusting support for emancipation.                                    a   Natural or adoptive children of either parent who live in the home of that parent                           and are not children in common to both parties may at the option of either party be taken into                           account under the guidelines in setting or modifying a child support award, as provided in                           Subsection    .  Credit may not be given if                                 i   by giving credit to the obligor, children for whom a prior support order exists would                           have their child support reduced  or                                ii   by giving credit to the obligee for a present family, the obligation of the obligor                           would increase.                                b   Additional worksheets shall be prepared that compute the obligations of the                           respective parents for the additional children.  The obligations shall then be subtracted from the                           appropriate parent s income before determining the award in the instant case.                                    In a proceeding to adjust or modify an existing award, consideration of natural or                           adoptive children born after entry of the order and who are not in common to both parties may                           be applied to mitigate an increase in the award but may not be applied                                 a   for the benefit of the obligee if the credit would increase the support obligation of                           the obligor from the most recent order  or                                b   for the benefit of the obligor if the amount of support received by the obligee would                           be decreased from the most recent order.                                    a   If a child support order has not been issued or modified within the previous                           three years, a parent, legal guardian, or the office may  petition  move the court to adjust the                           amount of a child support order.                                b   Upon receiving a  petition  motion under Subsection     a , the court shall, taking                           into account the best interests of the child, determine whether there is a difference between the                           amount ordered and the amount that would be required under the guidelines.  If there is a                              difference of     or more and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the court shall adjust                           the amount to that which is provided for in the guidelines.                                c   A showing of a substantial change in circumstances is not necessary for an                           adjustment under Subsection     b .                                    a   A parent, legal guardian, or the office may at any time petition the court to                           adjust the amount of a child support order if there has been a substantial change in                           circumstances.                                b   For purposes of Subsection     a , a substantial change in circumstances may                           include                                 i   material changes in custody                                 ii   material changes in the relative wealth or assets of the parties                                 iii   material changes of     or more in the income of a parent                                 iv   material changes in the ability of a parent to earn                                 v   material changes in the medical needs of the child  and                                 vi   material changes in the legal responsibilities of either parent for the support of                            others.                                 c   Upon receiving a petition under Subsection     a , the court shall, taking into                            account the best interests of the child, determine whether a substantial change has occurred.  If                            it has, the court shall then determine whether the change results in a difference of     or more                            between the amount of child support ordered and the amount that would be required under the                            guidelines.  If there is such a difference and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the                            court shall adjust the amount of child support ordered to that which is provided for in the                            guidelines.                                      Notice of the opportunity to adjust a support order under Subsections     and                                shall be included in each child support order issued or modified after July  ,     .
