B       .     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection     or ordered by the court, an orderappointing a receiver operates as a stay, applicable to all persons, of an act, action, orproceeding  a   to obtain possession of, exercise control over, or enforce a judgment againstreceivership property  and b   to enforce a lien against receivership property to the extent the lien secures a claimagainst the owner that arose before entry of the order.     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , the court may enjoin an act, action,or proceeding against or relating to receivership property if the injunction is necessary toprotect the property or facilitate administration of the receivership.     A person whose act, action, or proceeding is stayed or enjoined under this sectionmay apply to the court for relief from the stay or injunction for cause.     An order under Subsection     or     does not operate as a stay or injunction of  a   an act, action, or proceeding to foreclose or otherwise enforce a mortgage by theperson seeking appointment of the receiver  b   an act, action, or proceeding to perfect, or maintain or continue the perfection of, aninterest in receivership property  c   commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding  d   commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding, or enforcement of ajudgment other than a money judgment in an action or proceeding, by a governmental unit toenforce the governmental unit s police or regulatory power  or e   establishment by a governmental unit of a tax liability against the owner orreceivership property or an appeal of the liability.     The court may void an act that violates a stay or injunction under this section.     If a person knowingly violates a stay or injunction under this section, the court may  a   award actual damages caused by the violation, reasonable attorney fees, and costs and b   sanction the violation as civil contempt.       B       .     a   With court approval, a receiver may engage an attorney, accountant, appraiser,auctioneer, broker, or other professional to assist the receiver in performing a duty or exercisinga power of the receiver. b   The receiver shall disclose to the court  i   the identity and qualifications of the professional  ii   the scope and nature of the proposed engagement  iii   any potential conflict of interest  and iv   the proposed compensation.     a   A person is not disqualified from engagement under this section solely becauseof the person s engagement by, representation of, or other relationship with the receiver, acreditor, or a party. b   This chapter does not prevent the receiver from serving in the receivership as anattorney, accountant, auctioneer, or broker when authorized by law.     a   A receiver or professional engaged under Subsection     shall file with the courtan itemized statement of the time spent, work performed, and billing rate of each person thatperformed the work and an itemized list of expenses. b   The receiver shall pay the amount approved by the court.       B       .     As used in this section,  good faith  means honesty in fact and the observance ofreasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.     With court approval, a receiver may use receivership property other than in theordinary course of business.     a   With court approval, a receiver may transfer receivership property other than inthe ordinary course of business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other disposition. b   Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, a sale under this section is  i   free and clear of a lien of the person that obtained appointment of the receiver, anysubordinate lien, and any right of redemption  and ii   subject to a senior lien.     A lien on receivership property that is extinguished by a transfer under Subsection    attaches to the proceeds of the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority thelien had on the property immediately before the transfer, even if the proceeds are not sufficientto satisfy all obligations secured by the lien.     a   A transfer under Subsection     may occur by means other than a public auctionsale. b   A creditor holding a valid lien on the property to be transferred may purchase theproperty and offset against the purchase price part or all of the allowed amount secured by thelien, if the creditor tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable expenses of transferand the obligation secured by any senior lien extinguished by the transfer.     A reversal or modification of an order approving a transfer under Subsection    does not affect the validity of the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good faith orrevive against the person any lien extinguished by the transfer, whether the person knew beforethe transfer of the request for reversal or modification, unless the court stayed the order beforethe transfer.       B       .     As used in this section,  timeshare interest  means the same as that term is definedin Section        .     a   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , with court approval, a receivermay adopt or reject an executory contract of the owner relating to receivership property. b   The court may condition the receiver s adoption and continued performance of thecontract on terms appropriate under the circumstances. c   If the receiver does not request court approval to adopt or reject the executorycontract within a reasonable time after the receiver s appointment, the receiver is deemed tohave rejected the executory contract.     A receiver s performance of an executory contract before court approval underSubsection     of the executory contract s adoption or rejection is not an adoption of theexecutory contract and does not preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject theexecutory contract.     A provision in an executory contract that requires or permits a forfeiture,modification, or termination of the executory contract because of the appointment of a receiveror the financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver s power under Subsection    to adopt the executory contract.     a   A receiver s right to possess or use receivership property pursuant to anexecutory contract terminates on rejection of the executory contract under Subsection    . b   Rejection is a breach of the executory contract effective immediately beforeappointment of the receiver. c   A claim for damages for rejection of the executory contract must be submitted bythe later of  i   the time set for submitting a claim in the receivership  or ii      days after the court approves the rejection.     If at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has the right to assign an executorycontract relating to receivership property under law of this state other than this chapter, thereceiver may assign the executory contract with court approval.     If a receiver rejects an executory contract for the sale of receivership property thatis real property in possession of the purchaser or a real property timeshare interest underSubsection    , the purchaser may  a   treat the rejection as a termination of the executory contract, and in that case thepurchaser has a lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price thepurchaser paid  or b   retain the purchaser s right to possession under the executory contract, and in thatcase the purchaser shall continue to perform all obligations arising under the executory contractand may offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after thedate of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or claim against other receivership propertyor the receiver on account of the damages.     A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real property under which the owneris the landlord if  a   the tenant occupies the leased premises as the tenant s primary residence  b   the receiver was appointed at the request of a person other than a mortgagee  or c   the receiver was appointed at the request of a mortgagee and  i   the lease is superior to the lien of the mortgage  ii   the tenant has an enforceable agreement with the mortgagee or the holder of asenior lien under which the tenant s occupancy will not be disturbed as long as the tenantperforms the tenant s obligations under the lease  iii   the mortgagee has consented to the lease, either in a signed record or by themortgagee s failure to timely object that the lease violated the mortgage  or iv   the terms of the lease were commercially reasonable at the time the lease wasagreed to and the tenant did not know or have reason to know that the lease violated themortgage.       B       .     A receiver is entitled to all defenses and immunities provided by law of this stateother than this chapter for an act or omission within the scope of the receiver s appointment.     A receiver may be sued personally for an act or omission in administeringreceivership property only with approval of the court that appointed the receiver.       B       .A receiver may file, or if ordered by the court shall file, an interim report that includes      the activities of the receiver since appointment or a previous report      receipts and disbursements, including a payment made or proposed to be made to aprofessional engaged by the receiver      receipts and dispositions of receivership property      fees and expenses of the receiver and, if not filed separately, a request for approvalof payment of the fees and expenses  and     any other information required by the court.       B       .     Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , a receiver shall give notice ofappointment of the receiver to creditors of the owner by  a   deposit for delivery through first class mail or other commercially reasonabledelivery method to the last known address of each creditor  and b   publication as directed by the court.     a   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , the notice required bySubsection     must specify the date by which each creditor holding a claim against the ownerthat arose before appointment of the receiver must submit the claim to the receiver. b   The date specified must be at least    days after the later of the notice underSubsection     a  or the last publication under Subsection     b . c   The court may extend the period for submitting the claim. d   Unless the court orders otherwise, a claim that is not submitted timely is not entitledto a distribution from the receivership.     A claim submitted by a creditor under this section must  a   state the name and address of the creditor  b   state the amount and basis of the claim  c   identify any property securing the claim  d   be signed by the creditor under penalty of perjury  and e   include a copy of any record on which the claim is based.     An assignment by a creditor of a claim against the owner is effective against thereceiver only if the assignee gives timely notice of the assignment to the receiver in a signedrecord.     a   At any time before entry of an order approving a receiver s final report, thereceiver may file with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating the basis for theobjection. b   The court shall allow or disallow the claim according to law of this state other thanthis chapter.     If the court concludes that receivership property is likely to be insufficient to satisfyclaims of each creditor holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order that  a   the receiver need not give notice under Subsection     of the appointment to allcreditors of the owner, but only such creditors as the court directs  and b   unsecured creditors need not submit claims under this section.     Subject to Section   B         a   a distribution of receivership property to a creditor holding a perfected lien on theproperty must be made in accordance with the creditor s priority under law of this state otherthan this chapter  and b   a distribution of receivership property to a creditor with an allowed unsecured claimmust be made as the court directs according to law of this state other than this chapter.       B       .     The court may award a receiver from receivership property the reasonable andnecessary fees and expenses of performing the duties of the receiver and exercising the powersof the receiver.     The court may order one or more of the following to pay the reasonable andnecessary fees and expenses of the receivership, including reasonable attorney fees and costs  a   a person that requested the appointment of the receiver, if the receivership does notproduce sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses  or b   a person whose conduct justified or would have justified the appointment of thereceiver under Subsection   B           a .       B       .     The court may remove a receiver for cause.     The court shall replace a receiver that dies, resigns, or is removed.     If the court finds that a receiver that resigns or is removed, or the representative of areceiver that is deceased, has accounted fully for and turned over to the successor receiver allreceivership property and has filed a report of all receipts and disbursements during the serviceof the replaced receiver, the replaced receiver is discharged.     a   The court may discharge a receiver and terminate the court s administration ofthe receivership property if the court finds that appointment of the receiver was improvident orthat the circumstances no longer warrant continuation of the receivership. b   If the court finds that the appointment was sought wrongfully or in bad faith, thecourt may assess against the person that sought the appointment  i   the fees and expenses of the receivership, including reasonable attorney fees andcosts  and ii   actual damages caused by the appointment, including reasonable attorney fees andcosts.       B       .     On completion of a receiver s duties, the receiver shall file a final report including  a   a description of the activities of the receiver in the conduct of the receivership  b   a list of receivership property at the commencement of the receivership and anyreceivership property received during the receivership  c   a list of disbursements, including payments to professionals engaged by the receiver  d   a list of dispositions of receivership property  e   a list of distributions made or proposed to be made from the receivership forcreditor claims  f   if not filed separately, a request for approval of the payment of fees and expenses ofthe receiver  and g   any other information required by the court.     If the court approves a final report filed under Subsection     and the receiverdistributes all receivership property, the receiver is discharged.       B       .     The court may appoint a receiver appointed in another state, or that person snominee, as an ancillary receiver with respect to property located in this state or subject to thejurisdiction of the court for which a receiver could be appointed under this chapter, if  a   the person or nominee would be eligible to serve as receiver under Section  B         and b   the appointment furthers the person s possession, custody, control, or disposition ofproperty subject to the receivership in the other state.     The court may issue an order that gives effect to an order entered in another stateappointing or directing a receiver.     Unless the court orders otherwise, an ancillary receiver appointed under Subsection    has the rights, powers, and duties of a receiver appointed under this chapter.       B       .

The powers and duties of a receiver may be expanded, modified, or limited by court        order.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Duties of owner.                  An owner shall               a   assist and cooperate with the receiver in the administration of the receivership and        the discharge of the receiver s duties               b   preserve and turn over to the receiver all receivership property in the owner s        possession, custody, or control               c   identify all records and other information relating to the receivership property,        including a password, authorization, or other information needed to obtain or maintain access to        or control of the receivership property, and make available to the receiver the records and        information in the owner s possession, custody, or control               d   on subpoena, submit to examination under oath by the receiver concerning the acts,        conduct, property, liabilities, and financial condition of the owner or any matter relating to the        receivership property or the receivership  and              e   perform any duty imposed by court order, this chapter, or a law of the state other        than this chapter.                  If an owner is a person other than an individual, this section applies to each officer,        director, manager, member, partner, trustee, or other person exercising or having the power to        exercise control over the affairs of the owner.                  If a person knowingly fails to perform a duty imposed by this section, the court        may               a   award the receiver actual damages caused by the person s failure, reasonable        attorney fees, and costs  and              b   sanction the failure as civil contempt.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Stay    Injunction.                  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection     or ordered by the court, an order        appointing a receiver operates as a stay, applicable to all persons, of an act, action, or        proceeding               a   to obtain possession of, exercise control over, or enforce a judgment against        receivership property  and              b   to enforce a lien against receivership property to the extent the lien secures a claim        against the owner that arose before entry of the order.                  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , the court may enjoin an act, action,        or proceeding against or relating to receivership property if the injunction is necessary to        protect the property or facilitate administration of the receivership.                  A person whose act, action, or proceeding is stayed or enjoined under this section        may apply to the court for relief from the stay or injunction for cause.                  An order under Subsection     or     does not operate as a stay or injunction of               a   an act, action, or proceeding to foreclose or otherwise enforce a mortgage by the        person seeking appointment of the receiver               b   an act, action, or proceeding to perfect, or maintain or continue the perfection of, an        interest in receivership property               c   commencement or continuation of a criminal proceeding               d   commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding, or enforcement of a        judgment other than a money judgment in an action or proceeding, by a governmental unit to        enforce the governmental unit s police or regulatory power  or              e   establishment by a governmental unit of a tax liability against the owner or        receivership property or an appeal of the liability.                  The court may void an act that violates a stay or injunction under this section.                  If a person knowingly violates a stay or injunction under this section, the court may               a   award actual damages caused by the violation, reasonable attorney fees, and costs         and              b   sanction the violation as civil contempt.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Engagement and compensation of professional.                  a   With court approval, a receiver may engage an attorney, accountant, appraiser,        auctioneer, broker, or other professional to assist the receiver in performing a duty or exercising        a power of the receiver.              b   The receiver shall disclose to the court               i   the identity and qualifications of the professional               ii   the scope and nature of the proposed engagement               iii   any potential conflict of interest  and              iv   the proposed compensation.                  a   A person is not disqualified from engagement under this section solely because        of the person s engagement by, representation of, or other relationship with the receiver, a        creditor, or a party.              b   This chapter does not prevent the receiver from serving in the receivership as an        attorney, accountant, auctioneer, or broker when authorized by law.                  a   A receiver or professional engaged under Subsection     shall file with the court        an itemized statement of the time spent, work performed, and billing rate of each person that        performed the work and an itemized list of expenses.              b   The receiver shall pay the amount approved by the court.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Use or transfer of receivership property not in ordinary course of        business.                  As used in this section,  good faith  means honesty in fact and the observance of        reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.                  With court approval, a receiver may use receivership property other than in the        ordinary course of business.                  a   With court approval, a receiver may transfer receivership property other than in        the ordinary course of business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other disposition.              b   Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, a sale under this section is               i   free and clear of a lien of the person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any        subordinate lien, and any right of redemption  and              ii   subject to a senior lien.                  A lien on receivership property that is extinguished by a transfer under Subsection            attaches to the proceeds of the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority the        lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, even if the proceeds are not sufficient        to satisfy all obligations secured by the lien.                  a   A transfer under Subsection     may occur by means other than a public auction        sale.              b   A creditor holding a valid lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the        property and offset against the purchase price part or all of the allowed amount secured by the        lien, if the creditor tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable expenses of transfer        and the obligation secured by any senior lien extinguished by the transfer.                  A reversal or modification of an order approving a transfer under Subsection            does not affect the validity of the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good faith or        revive against the person any lien extinguished by the transfer, whether the person knew before        the transfer of the request for reversal or modification, unless the court stayed the order before        the transfer.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Executory contract.                  As used in this section,  timeshare interest  means the same as that term is defined        in Section        .                  a   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , with court approval, a receiver        may adopt or reject an executory contract of the owner relating to receivership property.              b   The court may condition the receiver s adoption and continued performance of the        contract on terms appropriate under the circumstances.              c   If the receiver does not request court approval to adopt or reject the executory        contract within a reasonable time after the receiver s appointment, the receiver is deemed to        have rejected the executory contract.                  A receiver s performance of an executory contract before court approval under        Subsection     of the executory contract s adoption or rejection is not an adoption of the        executory contract and does not preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the        executory contract.                  A provision in an executory contract that requires or permits a forfeiture,        modification, or termination of the executory contract because of the appointment of a receiver        or the financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver s power under Subsection            to adopt the executory contract.                  a   A receiver s right to possess or use receivership property pursuant to an        executory contract terminates on rejection of the executory contract under Subsection    .              b   Rejection is a breach of the executory contract effective immediately before        appointment of the receiver.              c   A claim for damages for rejection of the executory contract must be submitted by        the later of               i   the time set for submitting a claim in the receivership  or              ii      days after the court approves the rejection.                  If at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has the right to assign an executory        contract relating to receivership property under law of this state other than this chapter, the        receiver may assign the executory contract with court approval.                  If a receiver rejects an executory contract for the sale of receivership property that        is real property in possession of the purchaser or a real property timeshare interest under        Subsection    , the purchaser may               a   treat the rejection as a termination of the executory contract, and in that case the        purchaser has a lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price the        purchaser paid  or              b   retain the purchaser s right to possession under the executory contract, and in that        case the purchaser shall continue to perform all obligations arising under the executory contract        and may offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the        date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or claim against other receivership property        or the receiver on account of the damages.                  A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real property under which the owner        is the landlord if               a   the tenant occupies the leased premises as the tenant s primary residence               b   the receiver was appointed at the request of a person other than a mortgagee  or              c   the receiver was appointed at the request of a mortgagee and               i   the lease is superior to the lien of the mortgage               ii   the tenant has an enforceable agreement with the mortgagee or the holder of a        senior lien under which the tenant s occupancy will not be disturbed as long as the tenant        performs the tenant s obligations under the lease               iii   the mortgagee has consented to the lease, either in a signed record or by the        mortgagee s failure to timely object that the lease violated the mortgage  or              iv   the terms of the lease were commercially reasonable at the time the lease was        agreed to and the tenant did not know or have reason to know that the lease violated the        mortgage.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Defenses and immunities of receiver.                  A receiver is entitled to all defenses and immunities provided by law of this state        other than this chapter for an act or omission within the scope of the receiver s appointment.                  A receiver may be sued personally for an act or omission in administering        receivership property only with approval of the court that appointed the receiver.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Interim report of receiver.             A receiver may file, or if ordered by the court shall file, an interim report that includes                   the activities of the receiver since appointment or a previous report                   receipts and disbursements, including a payment made or proposed to be made to a        professional engaged by the receiver                   receipts and dispositions of receivership property                   fees and expenses of the receiver and, if not filed separately, a request for approval        of payment of the fees and expenses  and                  any other information required by the court.             Section   .  Section   B        is enacted to read                B       . Notice of appointment    Claim against receivership    Distribution to        creditors.                  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , a receiver shall give notice of        appointment of the receiver to creditors of the owner by               a   deposit for delivery through first class mail or other commercially reasonable        delivery method to the last known address of each creditor  and              b   publication as directed by the court.                  a   Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , the notice required by        Subsection     must specify the date by which each creditor holding a claim against the owner        that arose before appointment of the receiver must submit the claim to the receiver.              b   The date specified must be at least    days after the later of the notice under        Subsection     a  or the last publication under Subsection     b .              c   The court may extend the period for submitting the claim.              d   Unless the court orders otherwise, a claim that is not submitted timely is not entitled        to a distribution from the receivership.                  A claim submitted by a creditor under this section must               a   state the name and address of the creditor               b   state the amount and basis of the claim               c   identify any property securing the claim               d   be signed by the creditor under penalty of perjury  and              e   include a copy of any record on which the claim is based.                  An assignment by a creditor of a claim against the owner is effective against the        receiver only if the assignee gives timely notice of the assignment to the receiver in a signed        record.                  a   At any time before entry of an order approving a receiver s final report, the        receiver may file with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating the basis for the        objection.              b   The court shall allow or disallow the claim according to law of this state other than        this chapter.                  If the court concludes that receivership property is likely to be insufficient to satisfy        claims of each creditor holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order that               a   the receiver need not give notice under Subsection     of the appointment to all        creditors of the owner, but only such creditors as the court directs  and              b   unsecured creditors need not submit claims under this section.                  Subject to Section   B                      a   a distribution of receivership property to a creditor holding a perfected lien on the        property must be made in accordance with the creditor s priority under law of this state other        than this chapter  and              b   a distribution of receivership property to a creditor with an allowed unsecured claim        must be made as the court directs according to law of this state other than this chapter.

The court may award a receiver from receivership property the reasonable and        necessary fees and expenses of performing the duties of the receiver and exercising the powers        of the receiver.                  The court may order one or more of the following to pay the reasonable and        necessary fees and expenses of the receivership, including reasonable attorney fees and costs               a   a person that requested the appointment of the receiver, if the receivership does not        produce sufficient funds to pay the fees and expenses  or              b   a person whose conduct justified or would have justified the appointment of the        receiver under Subsection   B           a .

The court may remove a receiver for cause.                  The court shall replace a receiver that dies, resigns, or is removed.                  If the court finds that a receiver that resigns or is removed, or the representative of a        receiver that is deceased, has accounted fully for and turned over to the successor receiver all        receivership property and has filed a report of all receipts and disbursements during the service        of the replaced receiver, the replaced receiver is discharged.                  a   The court may discharge a receiver and terminate the court s administration of        the receivership property if the court finds that appointment of the receiver was improvident or        that the circumstances no longer warrant continuation of the receivership.              b   If the court finds that the appointment was sought wrongfully or in bad faith, the        court may assess against the person that sought the appointment               i   the fees and expenses of the receivership, including reasonable attorney fees and        costs  and              ii   actual damages caused by the appointment, including reasonable attorney fees and        costs.
