the court shall consider the        criteria under Subsections      a        c  i  through  vi  and provide findings of its decision        on the record.                  a   In addition to any other sentence the court may impose, and unless otherwise        ordered by the court, the defendant shall pay restitution of governmental transportation        expenses if the defendant was               i

A, B, or C misdemeanor  and              iii   convicted of a crime.              b   The court may not order the defendant to pay restitution of governmental        transportation expenses if any of the following apply               i   the defendant is charged with an infraction or on a subsequent failure to appear a        warrant is issued for an infraction  or              ii   the defendant was not transported pursuant to a court order.              c   i   Restitution of governmental transportation expenses under Subsection     a  i         shall be calculated according to the following schedule               A        for up to     miles a defendant is transported               B        for     up to     miles a defendant is transported  and              C        for     miles or more a defendant is transported.              ii   The schedule of restitution under Subsection     c  i  applies to each defendant        transported regardless of the number of defendants actually transported in a single trip.              d   If a defendant has been extradited to this state under Title   , Chapter   ,        Extradition, to resolve pending criminal charges and is convicted of criminal activity in the        county to which he has been returned, the court may, in addition to any other sentence it may        impose, order that the defendant make restitution for costs expended by any governmental        entity for the extradition.                  a   In addition to any other sentence the court may impose, and unless otherwise        ordered by the court pursuant to Subsection     c , the defendant shall pay restitution to the        county for the cost of incarceration and costs of medical care provided to the defendant while        in the county correctional

 A   the defendant is not a state prisoner housed in a county correctional facility        through a contract with the Department of Corrections  or              B   the reimbursement does not duplicate the reimbursement provided under Section             e     if the defendant is a state probationary inmate, as defined in Section      e    , or        a state parole inmate, as defined in Section      e    .              b   i   The costs of incarceration under Subsection     a  are the amount determined by        the county correctional facility, but may not exceed the daily inmate incarceration costs and        medical and transportation costs for the county correctional facility.              ii   The costs of incarceration under Subsection     a  do not include expenses incurred        by the county correctional facility in providing reasonable accommodation for an inmate        qualifying as an individual with a disability as defined and covered by the federal

to order that the restitution required under this Subsection            be reduced or that the defendant be exempted from the restitution, the court shall consider        the criteria under Subsections      a        c  i  through  vi  and shall enter the reason for its        order on the record.              d   If on appeal the defendant is found not guilty of the criminal activity under        Subsection     a  i  and that finding is final as defined in Section         , the county shall        reimburse the defendant for restitution the defendant paid for costs of incarceration under        Subsection     a .                  In addition to any other sentence the court may impose, the court shall determine        whether costs are appropriate pursuant to Section      a    .             Section  .

The court may place the defendant               i   on probation under the supervision of the Department of Corrections except in cases        of class C misdemeanors or infractions               ii   on probation under the supervision of an agency of local government or with a        private organization  or              iii   on court probation under the jurisdiction of the sentencing court.              b   i   The legal custody of all probationers under the supervision of the department is        with the department.              ii   The legal custody of all probationers under the jurisdiction of the sentencing court        is vested as ordered by the court.              iii   The court has continuing jurisdiction over all probationers.              iv   Court probation may include an administrative level of services, including        notification to the court of scheduled periodic reviews of the probationer s compliance with        conditions.              c   Supervised probation services provided by the department, an agency of local        government, or a private organization shall specifically address the offender s risk of        reoffending as identified by a validated risk and needs screening or assessment.                  a   The department shall establish supervision and presentence investigation        standards for all individuals referred to the department.  These standards shall be based on               i   the type of offense               ii   the results of a risk and needs assessment               iii   the demand for services               iv   the availability of agency resources               v   public safety  and              vi   other criteria established by the department to determine what level of services        shall be provided.              b   Proposed supervision and investigation standards shall be submitted to the Judicial        Council and the Board of Pardons and Parole on an annual basis for review and comment prior        to adoption by the department.              c   The Judicial Council and the department shall establish procedures to implement        the supervision and investigation standards.              d   The Judicial Council and the department shall annually consider modifications to        the standards based upon criteria in Subsection     a  and other criteria as they consider        appropriate.              e   The Judicial Council and the department shall annually prepare an impact report        and submit it to the appropriate legislative appropriations subcommittee.                  Notwithstanding other provisions of law, the department is not required to        supervise the probation of persons convicted of class B or C misdemeanors or infractions or to        conduct presentence investigation reports on class C misdemeanors or infractions.  However,        the department may supervise the probation of class B misdemeanants in accordance with        department standards.                  a   Before the imposition of any sentence, the court may, with the concurrence of        the defendant, continue the date for the imposition of sentence for a reasonable period of time        for the purpose of obtaining a presentence investigation report from the department or        information from other sources about the defendant.              b   The presentence investigation report shall include               i   a victim impact statement according to guidelines set in Section      a            describing the effect of the crime on the victim and the victim s family               ii   a specific statement of pecuniary damages, accompanied by a recommendation        from the department regarding the payment of restitution with interest by the defendant in        accordance with Title   , Chapter   a, Crime Victims Restitution Act               iii   findings from any screening and any assessment of the offender conducted under        Section        .                iv   recommendations for treatment of the offender  and              v   the number of days since the commission of the offense that the offender has spent        in the custody of the jail and the number of days, if any, the offender was released to a        supervised release or alternative incarceration program under Section        . .              c   The contents of the presentence investigation report are protected and are not        available except by court order for purposes of sentencing as provided by rule of the Judicial        Council or for use by the department.                  a   The department shall provide the presentence investigation report to the        defendant s attorney, or the defendant if not represented by counsel, the prosecutor, and the        court for review, three working days prior to sentencing.  Any alleged inaccuracies in the        presentence investigation report, which have not been resolved by the parties and the        department prior to sentencing, shall be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge, and        the judge may grant an additional    working days to resolve the alleged inaccuracies of the        report with the department.  If after    working days the inaccuracies cannot be resolved, the        court shall make a determination of relevance and accuracy on the record.              b   If a party fails to challenge the accuracy of the presentence investigation report at        the time of sentencing, that matter shall be considered to be waived.                  At the time of sentence, the court shall receive any testimony, evidence, or        information the defendant or the prosecuting attorney desires to present concerning the        appropriate sentence.  This testimony, evidence, or information shall be presented in open court        on record and in the presence of the defendant.                  While on probation, and as a condition of probation, the court may require that the        defendant               a   perform any or all of the following                i   pay, in one or several sums, any fine imposed at the time of being placed on        probation                 ii   pay amounts required under Title   , Chapter   a, Defense Costs                 iii    i   provide for the support of others for whose support the defendant is legally        liable                iv    ii   participate in available treatment programs, including any treatment program        in which the defendant is currently participating, if the program is acceptable to the court                v    iii   if on probation for a felony offense, serve a period of time, not to exceed one        year, in a county jail designated by the department, after considering any recommendation by        the court as to which jail the court finds most appropriate                vi    iv   serve a term of home confinement, which may include the use of electronic        monitoring                vii    v   participate in compensatory service restitution programs, including the        compensatory service program provided in Section         .                 viii    vi   pay for the costs of investigation, probation, and treatment services                ix    vii   make restitution or reparation to the victim or victims with interest in        accordance with Title   , Chapter   a, Crime Victims Restitution Act  and               x    viii   comply with other terms and conditions the court considers appropriate to        ensure public safety or increase a defendant s likelihood of success on probation  and              b   if convicted on or after May  ,                    i   complete high school classwork and obtain a high school graduation diploma, a        GED certificate, or a vocational certificate at the defendant s own expense if the defendant has        not received the diploma, GED certificate, or vocational certificate prior to being placed on        probation  or              ii   provide documentation of the inability to obtain one of the items listed in        Subsection     b  i  because of               A   a diagnosed learning disability  or              B   other justified cause.                  The department shall collect and disburse the  account  accounts receivable as        defined by Section          .        a    , with interest and any other costs assessed under        Section          during               a   the parole period and any extension of that period in accordance with Subsection                    and              b   the probation period in cases for which the court orders supervised probation and        any extension of that period by the department in accordance with Subsection     .                   a   i   Probation may be terminated at any time at the discretion of the court or        upon completion without violation of    months probation in felony or class A misdemeanor        cases,    months in cases of class B or C misdemeanors or infractions, or as allowed pursuant        to Section          regarding earned credits.              ii   A   If, upon expiration or termination of the probation period under Subsection             a  i , there remains an unpaid balance upon the  account  accounts receivable as defined        in Section          .        a    , the court may retain jurisdiction of the case and continue        the defendant on bench probation for the limited purpose of enforcing the payment of the        account receivable.  If the court retains jurisdiction for this limited purpose, the court may        order the defendant to pay to the court the costs associated with continued probation under this        Subsection     .              B   In accordance with Section        , the court shall record in the registry of civil        judgments any unpaid balance not already recorded and immediately transfer responsibility to        collect the account to the Office of State Debt Collection.              iii   Upon motion of the Office of State Debt Collection, prosecutor, victim, or upon its        own motion, the court may require the defendant to show cause why the defendant s failure to        pay should not be treated as contempt of court.              b   i   The department shall notify the sentencing court, the Office of State Debt        Collection, and the prosecuting attorney in writing in advance in all cases when termination of        supervised probation is being requested by the department or will occur by law.              ii   The notification shall include a probation progress report and complete report of        details on outstanding accounts receivable.                   a   i   Any time served by a probationer outside of confinement after having been        charged with a probation violation and prior to a hearing to revoke probation does not        constitute service of time toward the total probation term unless the probationer is exonerated        at a hearing to revoke the probation.              ii   Any time served in confinement awaiting a hearing or decision concerning        revocation of probation does not constitute service of time toward the total probation term        unless the probationer is exonerated at the hearing.              iii   Any time served in confinement awaiting a hearing or decision concerning        revocation of probation constitutes service of time toward a term of incarceration imposed as a        result of the revocation of probation or a graduated sanction imposed under Section          M      .              b   The running of the probation period is tolled upon the filing of a violation report        with the court alleging a violation of the terms and conditions of probation or upon the issuance        of an order to show cause or warrant by the court.                   a   i   Probation may be modified as is consistent with the graduated sanctions and        incentives developed by the Utah Sentencing Commission under Section   M      , but the        length of probation may not be extended, except upon waiver of a hearing by the probationer or        upon a hearing and a finding in court that the probationer has violated the conditions of        probation.              ii   Probation may not be revoked except upon a hearing in court and a finding that the        conditions of probation have been violated.              b   i   Upon the filing of an affidavit alleging with particularity facts asserted to        constitute violation of the conditions of probation, the court that authorized probation shall        determine if the affidavit establishes probable cause to believe that revocation, modification, or        extension of probation is justified.              ii   If the court determines there is probable cause, it shall cause to be served on the        defendant a warrant for the defendant s arrest or a copy of the affidavit and an order to show        cause why the defendant s probation should not be revoked, modified, or extended.              c   i   The order to show cause shall specify a time and place for the hearing and shall        be served upon the defendant at least five days prior to the hearing.              ii   The defendant shall show good cause for a continuance.              iii   The order to show cause shall inform the defendant of a right to be represented by        counsel at the hearing and to have counsel appointed if the defendant is indigent.              iv   The order shall also inform the defendant of a right to present evidence.              d   i   At the hearing, the defendant shall admit or deny the allegations of the affidavit.              ii   If the defendant denies the allegations of the affidavit, the prosecuting attorney        shall present evidence on the allegations.              iii   The persons who have given adverse information on which the allegations are        based shall be presented as witnesses subject to questioning by the defendant unless the court        for good cause otherwise orders.              iv   The defendant may call witnesses, appear and speak in the defendant s own behalf,        and present evidence.              e   i   After the hearing the court shall make findings of fact.              ii   Upon a finding that the defendant violated the conditions of probation, the court        may order the probation revoked, modified, continued, or reinstated for all or a portion of the        original term of probation.              iii   If a period of incarceration is imposed for a violation, the defendant shall be        sentenced within the guidelines established by the Utah Sentencing Commission pursuant to        Subsection   M         , unless the judge determines that               A   the defendant needs substance abuse or mental health treatment, as determined by a        validated risk and needs screening and assessment, that warrants treatment services that are        immediately available in the community  or              B   the sentence previously imposed shall be executed.              iv   If the defendant had, prior to the imposition of a term of incarceration or the        execution of the previously imposed sentence under this Subsection     , served time in jail as        a condition of probation or due to a violation of probation under Subsection                      e  iii , the time the probationer served in jail constitutes service of time toward        the sentence previously imposed.                   The court may order the defendant to commit himself or herself to the custody of        the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health for treatment at the Utah State Hospital as        a condition of probation or stay of sentence, only after the superintendent of the Utah State        Hospital or the superintendent s designee has certified to the court that               a   the defendant is appropriate for and can benefit from treatment at the state hospital               b   treatment space at the hospital is available for the defendant  and              c   persons described in Subsection   A           g  are receiving priority for        treatment over the defendants described in this Subsection     .                   Presentence investigation reports are classified protected in accordance with Title          G, Chapter  , Government Records Access and Management Act.  Notwithstanding Sections          G       and   G      , the State Records Committee may not order the disclosure of a        presentence investigation report.

If restitution to more than one person, agency, or entity is required at the same time,        the department shall establish the following priorities of payment, except as provided in        Subsection                   a   the crime victim               b   the Utah Office for Victims of Crime               c   any other government agency which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a        result of the offender s criminal conduct               d   the person, entity, or governmental agency that has offered and paid a reward under        Section          .        a     or   A                     e   any insurance company which has provided reimbursement to the victim as a result        of the offender s criminal conduct  and              f   any county correctional facility to which the defendant is required to pay restitution        under Subsection            .                  Restitution ordered under Subsection     f  is paid after criminal fines and        surcharges are paid.                  If the offender is required under Section           to reimburse the department for        the cost of obtaining the offender s DNA specimen, this reimbursement is the next priority after        restitution to the crime victim under Subsection     a .                  All money collected for court ordered obligations from offenders by the department        will be applied               a   first, to victim restitution, except the current and past due amount of     per month        required to be collected by the department under Section         , if applicable  and              b   second, if applicable, to the cost of obtaining a DNA specimen under Subsection           .                  Restitution owed to more than one victim shall be disbursed to each victim        according to the percentage of each victim s share of the total restitution order.             Section   .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    . Default and sanctions.                  When a defendant defaults in the payment of a judgment for restitution or any        installment ordered, the court, on motion of the prosecutor, parole or probation agent, victim,        or on its own motion may               a   impose sanctions against the defendant as provided in Section          . .              a      or              b   if the payment of restitution to a victim was a term of probation, begin probation        violation proceedings as provided in Subsection            .                  The court may not impose a sanction against the defendant under Subsection     if               a   the defendant s sole default in the payment of a judgement for restitution is the        failure to pay restitution ordered under Subsection             regarding costs of incarceration        in a county correctional facility  and              b   the sanction would extend the defendant s term of probation or parole.

Section   .  Section   B       is enacted to read                B      . Willful failure to pay criminal judgment accounts receivable.                  If a criminal judgment accounts receivable has become delinquent as defined in        Section      a    , the court, by motion of the prosecutor, a judgment creditor, the Office of        State Debt Collection, or on the court s own motion, may order the defendant to appear and        show cause why the delinquency should not be treated as contempt of court, as provided in this        section.                  a   The moving party or a court clerk shall provide a declaration outlining the        nature of the debt and the delinquency.              b   Upon receipt of that declaration, the court shall set the matter for a hearing and        provide notice of the hearing to the defendant by mailing notice of the hearing to the        defendant s last known address and by any other means the court finds likely to provide        defendant notice of the hearing.              i   If it appears to the court that the defendant is not likely to appear at the hearing, the        court may issue an arrest warrant with a bail amount reasonably likely to guarantee the        defendant s appearance.              ii   If the defendant is a corporation or an unincorporated association, the court shall        cite the person authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the corporation or        association to appear to answer for the alleged contempt.                  At the hearing the defendant is entitled to be represented by counsel and, if the        court is considering a period of incarceration as a potential sanction, appointed counsel if the        defendant is indigent.

Any jail sanction imposed for contempt under this section shall serve to satisfy the        criminal judgment account receivable at      for each day served. Amounts satisfied under this        Subsection     may not include restitution amounts ordered by the court in accordance with        Title   , Chapter   a, Crime Victims Restitution Act.                  Any financial penalty authorized by Section   B       and ordered by the court        may only become due after the satisfaction of the original criminal account receivable.                  The order of the court finding the defendant in contempt and ordering sanctions is a        final appealable order.             Section   . Repealer.
