Legislative Review Note      as of                PM    This bill regulates Internet businesses who provide services to Utah residents.  Case law  surrounding regulation of Internet activities is evolving.  State regulations of Internet activities  have been challenged for violating principles such as the Commerce Clause of the United  States Constitution.  Some courts have indicated that the need for national uniformity might  limit a state s ability to regulate Internet activities.  Other court rulings indicate that regulations  like those contained in this bill could be upheld because the regulations do not impose a greater  burden on out of state Internet businesses than is imposed on in state Internet businesses and  regulate only service that is provided to Utah residents.
