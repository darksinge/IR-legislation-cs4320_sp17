Section               is amended to read                                       .  Criminal procedures.                                    In cases where an owner is criminally prosecuted for conduct giving rise to                           forfeiture, the prosecuting attorney may elect to forfeit the owner s interest in the property                           civilly or criminally, provided that no civil forfeiture judgment may be entered with respect to                           the property of a defendant who is acquitted of the offense on which the forfeiture claim is                           based.                                    If the prosecuting attorney elects to criminally forfeit the owner s interest in the                           property, the information or indictment must state that the owner s interest in the specifically                           described property is subject to criminal forfeiture and the basis for the forfeiture.                                    a   Upon application of the prosecuting attorney, the court may enter restraining                           orders or injunctions, or take other reasonable action to preserve for forfeiture under this                           section any forfeitable property if, after notice to persons known, or discoverable after due                           diligence, to have an interest in the property and after affording them an opportunity for a                           hearing, the court determines that                                 i   there is a substantial probability that the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture                           and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being sold, transferred, destroyed,                           or removed from the jurisdiction of the court or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture  and                                ii   the need to preserve the availability of the property or prevent its sale, transfer,                           destruction, or removal through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship against                           any party against whom the order is to be entered.                                b   A temporary restraining order may be entered ex parte upon application of the                           prosecuting attorney before or after an information or indictment has been filed with respect to                              the property, if the prosecuting attorney demonstrates that                                 i   there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is                           sought would, in the event of a conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section  and                                ii   provision of notice would jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture                           or would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.                                c   The temporary order expires not more than ten days after entry unless extended for                           good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension.  An                           adversarial hearing concerning an order entered under this  paragraph  section shall be held as                           soon as practicable and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.                                d   The court is not bound by the Utah Rules of Evidence regarding evidence it may                           receive and consider at any hearing under this  paragraph  section.                                    a   Upon conviction by a jury of an owner for conduct giving rise to criminal                           forfeiture, the jury shall be instructed and asked to return a special verdict as to the extent of                           the property identified in the information or indictment, if any, that is forfeitable.                                b   Whether property is forfeitable shall be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.                                    a   Upon conviction of a person for violating any provision of state law subjecting                           an owner s property to forfeiture and upon the jury s special verdict that the property is                           forfeitable, the court shall enter a judgment and order the property forfeited to the state                            treasurer  upon the terms stated by the court in its order.                                b   Following the entry of an order declaring property forfeited, the court may, upon                           application of the prosecuting attorney, enter appropriate restraining orders or injunctions,                           require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators,                           appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the state in                           property ordered forfeited.                                    a   After property is ordered forfeited under this section, the  state treasurer  seizing                          agency shall direct the disposition of the property under Section                              .  Any                           property right or interest not exercisable by or transferable for value to the state expires and                           does not revert to the defendant.  The defendant or any person acting in concert with or on                              behalf of the defendant is not eligible to purchase forfeited property at any sale held by the                            state treasurer  seizing agency unless approved by the judge.                                b   The court may stay the sale or disposition of the property pending the conclusion of                           any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture if the defendant demonstrates that                           proceeding with the sale or disposition of the property may result in irreparable injury, harm or                           loss to him.                                    Except under  Subparagraphs  Subsection     or     , a party claiming an interest in                           property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section                                 a   may not intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving the forfeiture of                           property under this section  and                                b   may not commence an action at law or equity against the state or the county                           concerning the validity of his alleged interests in the property subsequent to the filing of an                           indictment or an information alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this                           section.                                     The district court of the state which has jurisdiction of a case under this part may                            enter orders under this section without regard to the location of any property which may be                            subject to forfeiture under this section, or which has been ordered forfeited under this section.                                     To facilitate the identification or location of property declared forfeited and to                            facilitate the disposition of petitions for remission or mitigation of forfeiture, after the entry of                            an order declaring property forfeited to the state  treasurer , the court ,  may upon application                            of the prosecuting attorney ,  order that the testimony of any witness relating to the property                            forfeited be taken by deposition, and that any book, paper, document, record, recording, or                            other material not privileged shall be produced as provided for depositions and discovery under                            the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.                                      a   Following the entry of an order of forfeiture under this section, the prosecuting                            attorney shall publish notice of the order s intent to dispose of the property as the court may                            direct.  The prosecuting attorney shall also provide direct written notice to any person known to                            have an alleged interest in the property subject to the order of forfeiture.                                    b   Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property which                            has been ordered forfeited to the state  treasurer  under this section may, within    days of the                            final publication of notice or his receipt of written notice under  Subparagraph  a   Subsection                                a , whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his                            alleged interest in the property.  Any genuine issue of material fact, including issues of                            standing, is triable to a jury upon demand of any party.                                 c   The petition shall be in writing and signed by the petitioner under penalty of                            perjury.  It shall set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner s right, title, or interest in the                            property, the time and circumstances of the petitioner s acquisition of the right, title, or interest                            in the property, and any additional facts supporting the petitioner s claim and the relief sought.                                 d   The trial or hearing on the petition shall be expedited to the extent practicable.  The                            court may consolidate a trial or hearing on the petition and any petition filed by any other                            person under this section other than the defendant.  The court shall permit the parties to                            conduct pretrial discovery pursuant to the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.                                 e   At the trial or hearing, the petitioner may testify and present evidence and witnesses                            on his own behalf and cross examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.  The prosecuting                            attorney may present evidence and witnesses in rebuttal and in defense of the claim to the                            property and cross examine witnesses who appear.  In addition to testimony and evidence                            presented at the trial or hearing, the court may consider the relevant portion of the record of the                            criminal case which resulted in the order of forfeiture.  Any trial or hearing shall be conducted                            pursuant to the Utah Rules of Evidence.                                 f   The court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination, if                            after the trial or hearing, the court or jury determines that the petitioner has established by a                            preponderance of the evidence that                                  i   the petitioner has a legal right, title, or interest in the property, and the right, title, or                            interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right, title, or                            interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title,                            or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts or conduct which gave rise                               to the forfeiture of the property under this section  or                                 ii   the petitioner acquired the right, title or interest in the property in a bona fide                            transaction for value and, at the time of such acquisition, the petitioner did not know that the                            property was subject to forfeiture.                                 g   Following the court s disposition of all petitions filed under this  paragraph                            Subsection     , or if no petitions are filed following the expiration of the period provided in                             Subparagraph  b   Subsection      b  for the filing of petitions, the state  treasurer  has clear                            title to property subject to the order of forfeiture and may warrant good title to any subsequent                            purchaser or transferee.                                Section  .    Section                is amended to read                                         .  Transfer and sharing procedures.                                     For purposes of this section, property is considered to be  seized  whenever any                           state, county, or municipal law enforcement agency takes possession of the property or                            exercises any degree of control over the property.                                     When property is seized pursuant to the order of a state district court or state                           statute, the state has priority jurisdiction.                                      a        Seizing agencies or prosecuting attorneys authorized to bring civil or                            criminal forfeiture proceedings under this chapter may not directly or indirectly transfer seized                            property not already named in a criminal indictment to any federal agency or any governmental                            entity not created under and subject to state law unless the court enters an order, upon petition                            of the prosecuting attorney, authorizing the property to be transferred.  The court may not enter                            an order authorizing a transfer unless                                   i    a   the  activity  conduct giving rise to the investigation or seizure is interstate in                            nature and sufficiently complex to justify the transfer                                   ii    b   the seized property may only be forfeited under federal law  or                                  iii    c   pursuing forfeiture under state law would unreasonably burden prosecuting                            attorneys or state law enforcement agencies.

basis for relinquishing priority jurisdiction to a federal agency  and                                 iii   contains the names and addresses of any potential owners then known.                                  b        Notwithstanding Subsection      a      , the court may refuse to enter an order                            authorizing a transfer to the federal government if the transfer would circumvent the                            protections of the Utah Constitution or of this chapter that would otherwise be available to the                            property owner.                                  c        a   Prior to granting any order to transfer pursuant to Subsection      a      ,                            the court  must  shall give any owner the right to be heard with regard to the transfer .  by                           sending notice to each address contained in the sworn affidavit.                                 b   If no potential owner objects to the petition to transfer property within ten days of                           the mailing of the notice, the court shall issue its order under this section.                                 c   If the affidavit provides no address for a potential owner, the court shall delay its                           order under this section for    days to allow time for the potential owner to appear and object.                                     a   If a potential owner contests a petition to transfer property to a federal agency,                           the court shall promptly set the matter for hearing.                                 b   The court shall determine whether the state may relinquish priority jurisdiction by a                           preponderance of the evidence by considering hardship, complexity, judicial, and law                           enforcement resources, and any other matter the court determines to be relevant.
