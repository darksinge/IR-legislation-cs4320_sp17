The Legislature finds that                                  a   it is in the interest of the people of the state to improve the safety of existing dams                                  b   mutual irrigation companies and water users associations cannot afford to bring dams                            into conformance with the state s current minimum safety standards without financial assistance                            from the state                                  c   due to limited financial, physical, and human resources, it is necessary to establish                            priorities for the upgrade of dams  and                                 d   the state and its officers and employees are immune from suit for any injury or damage                            resulting from the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform any function                            pursuant to this chapter.                                     The state engineer shall establish minimum standards for existing high hazard dams                            by rule.  The standards for existing high hazard dams may differ from the design criteria                            established for new construction.                                     No seismic standards shall be established for existing high hazard dams within the                            flood control use classification.                                     a   In implementing this section, the state engineer will develop a priority list of high                            hazard dams.  The list will be determined by calculating the relative anticipated breach flows in                            the event of a dam failure.  The dams will be ranked from the largest breach flow to the smallest                            for all high hazard dams.                                 b   The state engineer shall investigate annually    dams on the priority list in order of                            their ranking to determine in what areas they are deficient or do not meet minimum standards.                                 c   Once a determination is made, the owner will be notified that the owner will be                            required to undertake investigations to determine requirements necessary to bring the dam into                            compliance with minimum standards.                                    d   Once the owner has been informed of the deficiencies of the dam, the owner will be                            given    days to respond, in writing, as to what steps the owner is taking to investigate the                            deficiencies and the time required to complete the investigations.                                 e   The state engineer will review the proposal, and if it appears reasonable, will approve                            it.                                    The state engineer may not require any mutual irrigation company or water users                            association to upgrade a dam in conformance with minimum standards, unless a grant to pay for                                of the costs is made available from the Board of Water Resources and Conservation.
