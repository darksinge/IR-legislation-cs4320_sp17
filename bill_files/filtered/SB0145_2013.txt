An order authorizing the interception of a wire, electronic, or oral  communication                            communications shall, upon request of the applicant, direct that a provider of wire or electronic                            communications service, landlord, custodian, or other person shall furnish the applicant                            forthwith all information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the                            interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that the                            provider, landlord, custodian, or person is according the person whose communications are to                            be intercepted.  Any provider of wire or electronic communications service, landlord,                            custodian, or other person furnishing the facilities or technical assistance shall be compensated                            by the applicant for reasonable expenses involved in providing the facilities or systems.                                     a   An order entered under this chapter may not authorize or approve the                            interception of any wire, electronic, or oral  communication  communications for any period                            longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization, but in any event for no                            longer than    days.  The    day period begins on the day the investigative or law enforcement                            officer first begins to conduct an interception under the order, or    days after the order is                            entered, whichever is earlier.                                 b   Extensions of an order may be granted, but only upon application for an extension                            made under Subsection     ,  and if the court makes the findings required by Subsection    .                             The period of extension may be no longer than the authorizing judge considers necessary to                            achieve the purposes for which it was granted, but in no event for longer than    days.                                 c   Every order and extension shall contain a provision that the authorization to                            intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted so as to minimize the                            interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter, and                            must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event within    days.                                 d   If the intercepted communication is in a code or foreign language, and an expert in                            that foreign language or code is not reasonably available during the interception period, the                            minimizing of the interception may be accomplished as soon as practicable after the                            interception.                                 e   An interception under this chapter may be conducted in whole or in part by                               government personnel or by an individual under contract with the government and acting under                            supervision of an investigative or law enforcement officer authorized to conduct the                            interception.                                     When an order authorizing interception is entered under this chapter, the order may                            require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order, showing what progress has been                            made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continued interception.                             These reports shall be made at intervals the judge may require.

The recording of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral                             communication  communications under this Subsection     a  shall be done so as to protect                            the recording from editing or other alterations.  Immediately upon the expiration of the period                            of an order ,  or extension, the recordings shall be made available to the judge issuing the order                            and sealed under his directions.  Custody of the recordings shall be where the judge orders.                             The recordings may not be destroyed, except upon an order of the issuing or denying judge.  In                            any event, it shall be kept for    years.
