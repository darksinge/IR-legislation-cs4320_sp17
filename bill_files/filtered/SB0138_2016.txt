McKell             LONG TITLE      General Description             This bill amends the Insurance Code related to health insurance coverage for emergency       care.        Highlighted Provisions             This bill                    requires a health insurer to, at a minimum, provide coverage for emergency care that       is medically necessary to stabilize an emergency medical condition  and                  authorizes the insurance commissioner to impose fines if an insurer violates the       emergency care coverage standards.        Money Appropriated in this Bill             None       Other Special Clauses             None       Utah Code Sections Affected        AMENDS               A       , as last amended by Laws of Utah     , Chapter                   Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah             Section  .  Section   A        is amended to read               A       . Coverage of emergency medical services.                 A health insurance policy or health maintenance organization contract               a   shall provide, at a minimum, coverage of emergency services as required in          C.F.R. Sec.     .        A  and              b   may not               a    i   require any form of preauthorization for treatment of an emergency medical       condition until after the insured s condition has been stabilized  or              b    ii   deny a claim for any covered evaluation, covered diagnostic test, or other       covered treatment considered medically necessary to stabilize the emergency medical condition       of an insured.                 A health insurance policy or health maintenance organization contract may require       authorization for the continued treatment of an emergency medical condition after the insured s       condition has been stabilized.  If such authorization is required, an insurer who does not accept       or reject a request for authorization may not deny a claim for any evaluation, diagnostic testing,       or other treatment considered medically necessary that occurred between the time the request       was received and the time the insurer rejected the request for authorization.                 For purposes of this section              a    emergency medical condition  means a medical condition manifesting itself by       acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such that a prudent layperson,       who possesses an average knowledge of medicine and health, would reasonably expect the       absence of immediate medical attention at a hospital emergency department to result in              i   placing the insured s health, or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the       woman or her unborn child, in serious jeopardy              ii   serious impairment to bodily functions  or             iii   serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part  and             b    hospital emergency department  means that area of a hospital in which emergency       services are provided on a    hour a day basis.                 Nothing in this section may be construed as              a   altering the level or type of benefits that are provided under the terms of a contract       or policy  or             b   restricting a policy or contract from providing enhanced benefits for certain       emergency medical conditions that are identified in the policy or contract.                 Notwithstanding Section   A      , if the commissioner finds an insurer has       violated this section, the commissioner may              a   work with the insurer to improve the insurer s compliance with this section  or             b   impose the following fines              i   not more than   ,     or             ii   twice the amount of any profit gained from violations of this section.
