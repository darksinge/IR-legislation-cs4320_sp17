In no case shall the period of a temporary order exceed one                            year.                                 iv   An application for a temporary order under Subsection     d  shall contain                                  A   a specification of the standard or part from which the employer seeks a variance                                  B   a representation by the employer, supported by representations from qualified persons                            having first hand knowledge of the facts represented, that the employer is unable to comply with                            the standard or some part of the standard                                  C   a detailed statement of the reasons the employer is unable to comply                                  D   a statement of the measures taken and anticipated with specific dates, to protect                            employees against the hazard                                  E   a statement of when the employer expects to comply with the standard and what                            measures the employer has taken and those anticipated, giving specific dates for compliance  and                                 F   a certification that the employer has informed the employer s employees of the                            application by                                  I   giving a copy to their authorized representative                                  II   posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy                            may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted  and                                 III   by other appropriate means.                                 v   The certification required under Subsection     d  iv  shall contain a description of                            how employees have been informed.                                 vi   The information to employees required under Subsection     d  v  shall inform the                            employees of their right to petition the division for a hearing.                                 vii   The administrator is authorized to grant a variance from any standard or some part                            of the standard when the administrator determines that it is necessary to permit an employer to                            participate in a research and development project approved by the administrator to demonstrate                            or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the health or safety of workers.                                 e   i   Any standard issued under this subsection shall prescribe the use of labels or other                            forms of warning necessary to ensure that employees are apprised of all hazards, relevant                            symptoms and emergency treatment, and proper conditions and precautions of safe use or                               exposure. When appropriate, a standard shall prescribe suitable protective equipment and control                            or technological procedures for use in connection with such hazards and provide for monitoring                            or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals, and in a manner necessary for the                            protection of employees.  In addition, any such standard shall prescribe the type and frequency of                            medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available by the employer, or at his cost,                            to employees exposed to hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of                            employees is adversely affected by exposure.  If medical examinations are in the nature of research                            as determined by the division, the examinations may be furnished at division expense.  The results                            of such examinations or tests shall be furnished only to the division  and, at the request of the                            employee, to the employee s physician.                                 ii   The administrator may by rule make appropriate modifications in requirements for the                            use of labels or other forms of warning, monitoring or measuring, and medical examinations                            warranted by experience, information, or medical or technological developments acquired                            subsequent to the promulgation of the relevant standard.                                 f   Whenever a rule issued by the administrator differs substantially from an existing                            national consensus standard, the division shall publish a statement of the reasons why the rule as                            adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this chapter than the national consensus standard.                                 g   Whenever a rule, standard, or national consensus standard is modified by the secretary                            so as to make less restrictive the federal Williams Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of                                , the less restrictive modification shall be immediately applicable to this chapter and shall be                            immediately implemented by the division.                                     a   The administrator shall provide an emergency temporary standard to take immediate                            effect upon publication if the administrator determines that                                  i   employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents                            determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards  and                                 ii   that the standard is necessary to protect employees from danger.                                 b   An emergency standard shall be effective until superseded by a standard issued in                            accordance with the procedures prescribed in Subsection     c .                                 c   Upon publication of an emergency standard the division shall commence a proceeding                            in accordance with Subsection     and the standard as published shall serve as a proposed rule for                            the proceedings.  The division shall issue a standard under Subsection     no later than     days                               after publication of the emergency standard.                                     a   Any affected employer may apply to the division for a rule or order for a variance                            from a standard issued under this section.  Affected employees shall be given notice of each                            application and may participate in a hearing.  The administrator shall issue a rule or order if the                            administrator determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and                            a hearing, that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence                            that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations, or processes used or proposed to be                            used by an employer will provide employment and a workplace to the employer s employees that                            are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if the employer complied with the standard.                                 b   The rule or order issued under Subsection     a  shall prescribe the conditions the                            employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations and processes that the                            employer must adopt and use to the extent they differ from the standard in question.                                 c   A rule or order issued under Subsection     a  may be modified or revoked upon                            application by an employer, employees, or by the administrator on its own motion, in the manner                            prescribed for its issuance under Subsection     at any time after six months from its issuance.                                    The administrator shall include a statement of reasons for the administrator s actions                            when the administrator                                  a   issues any code, standard, rule, or order                                  b   grants any exemption or extension of time  or                                 c   compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this chapter.                                     Any person adversely affected by a standard issued under this section, at any time prior                            to    days after a standard is issued, may file a petition challenging its validity with the district                            court having jurisdiction for judicial review.  A copy of the petition shall be served upon the                            division by the petitioner.  The filing of a petition shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the court,                            operate as a stay of the standard.  The determinations of the division shall be conclusive if                            supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.                                     In determining the priority for establishing standards under this section, the division                            shall give due regard to the urgency of the need for mandatory safety and health standards for                            particular industries, trades, crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments.                             The administrator shall also give due regard to the recommendations of the Department of Health                            about the need for mandatory standards in determining the priority for establishing the standards.
