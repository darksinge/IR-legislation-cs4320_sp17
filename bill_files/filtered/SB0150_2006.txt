If the court, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offense of which                           the defendant was found guilty and to the history and character of the defendant, concludes it                           would be unduly harsh to record the conviction as being for that degree of offense established                           by statute and to sentence the defendant to an alternative normally applicable to that offense,                           the court may unless otherwise specifically provided by law enter a judgment of conviction for                           the next lower degree of offense and impose sentence accordingly.                                    If a conviction is for a third degree felony the conviction is considered to be for a                           class A misdemeanor if                                 a   the judge designates the sentence to be for a class A misdemeanor and the sentence                           imposed is within the limits provided by law for a class A misdemeanor  or                                b   i   the imposition of the sentence is stayed and the defendant is placed on probation,                           whether committed to jail as a condition of probation or not                                 ii   the defendant is subsequently discharged without violating his probation  and                                iii   the judge upon motion and notice to the prosecuting attorney, and a hearing if                           requested by either party or the court, finds it is in the interest of justice that the conviction be                           considered to be for a class A misdemeanor.                                    An offense may be reduced only one degree under this section unless the prosecutor                           specifically agrees in writing or on the court record that the offense may be reduced two                           degrees.

Judgment for a conviction for a lower degree of offense may not be entered if there                          remains any unpaid balance on court ordered restitution for the offense for which the reduction                          is sought.
