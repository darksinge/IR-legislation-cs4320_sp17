Section                is repealed and reenacted to read                                       .  Asset Protection Trust.                                    As used in this section                                 a    Creditor  means                                 i   a creditor or other claimant of the settlor existing when the trust is created  or                                ii   a person who subsequently becomes a creditor, including, whether or not reduced                          to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,                          undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured                                 A   one holding or seeking to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body                          having adjudicative authority  or                                B   one with a right to payment.                                b    Property  means real property, personal property, and interests in real or personal                          property.                                c    Settlor  means a person who transfers property in trust.                                d    Transfer  means any form of transfer of property, including gratuitous transfers,                          whether by deed, conveyance, or assignment.                                e    Trust  has the same meaning as in Section                 .                                     Paid and delivered  to the settlor, as beneficiary, does not include the settlor s use                          or occupancy of real property or tangible personal property owned by the trust if the use or                          occupancy is in accordance with the trustee s discretionary authority under the trust instrument.                                    If the settlor of an irrevocable trust is also a beneficiary of the trust, and if the                          requirements of Subsection     are satisfied, a creditor of the settlor may not                                 a   satisfy a claim or liability of the settlor in either law or equity out of the settlor s                          transfer to the trust or the settlor s beneficial interest in the trust                                 b   force or require the trustee to make a distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary  or                                c   require the trustee to pay any distribution directly to the creditor, or otherwise                          attach the distribution before it has been paid or delivered by the trustee to the settlor, as                          beneficiary.                                    Notwithstanding Subsection    , nothing in this section prohibits a creditor from                          satisfying a claim or liability from the distribution once it has been paid or delivered by the                             trustee to the settlor, as beneficiary.                                    In order for Subsection     to apply, the conditions in this Subsection     shall be                          satisfied.  Where this Subsection     requires that a provision be included in the trust                          instrument, no particular language need be used in the trust instrument if the meaning of the                          trust provision otherwise complies with this Subsection    .                                a   At least one trustee shall be a Utah resident or a trust company, as the term  trust                          company  is defined in Section              .                                b   At all times, trust assets with a value equal to at least     of the value of all trust                          assets shall be held in this state.  An asset is held in this state if it                                 i   is real property located in this state  or                                ii   is held in this state in a savings account described in Section                , a certificate                          of deposit, a brokerage account, a trust company fiduciary account, or an account or deposit                          located in this state that is similar to any of the accounts described above.                                c   The trust instrument shall provide that neither the interest of the settlor, as                          beneficiary, nor the income or principal of the trust may be voluntarily or involuntarily                          transferred by the settlor, as beneficiary.  The provision shall be considered to be a restriction                          on the transfer of the settlor s beneficial interest in the trust that is enforceable under applicable                          nonbankruptcy law within the meaning of Section     c     of the Bankruptcy Code.                                d   The settlor may not have the ability under the trust instrument to revoke, amend, or                          terminate all or any part of the trust, or to withdraw property from the trust, without the consent                          of a person who has a substantial beneficial interest in the trust, which interest would be                          adversely affected by the exercise of the power held by the settlor.                                e   The trust instrument may not provide for any mandatory distributions of either                          income or principal to the settlor, as beneficiary, except as provided in Subsection     f .                                f   The settlor may not benefit from, direct a distribution of, or use trust property                          except as stated in the trust instrument.  An agreement or understanding, express or implied,                          between the settlor and the trustee that attempts to grant or permit the retention of greater rights                          or authority than is stated in the trust instrument is void.                                g   The trust instrument shall require that, at least    days before making any                          distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary, the trustee notify every person who has a child support                          judgment or order against the settlor.  The notice shall state the date the distribution will be                             made and the amount of the distribution.                                h   At least    days before making any distribution to the settlor, as beneficiary, the                          trustee shall in fact notify every person who has a child support judgment, or order against the                          settlor, of the date the distribution will be made and the amount of the distribution.                                i   At the time that the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not be in                          default of making a payment due under any child support judgment or order.                                j   No transfer of assets to the trust may render the settlor insolvent.                                k   At the time the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not intend to                          hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor by transferring the assets to the trust.  A settlor s                          expressed intention to protect trust assets from the settlor s potential future creditors is not                           evidence of an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor.                                 l   At the time that the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor may not be                           contemplating filing for relief under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.                                 m   Assets transferred to the trust may not be derived from unlawful activities.                                 n   At the time the settlor transfers any assets to the trust, the settlor shall sign a sworn                           affidavit stating that                                  i   the settlor has full right, title, and authority to transfer the assets to the trust                                  ii   the transfer of the assets to the trust will not render the settlor insolvent                                  iii   the settlor does not intend to hinder, delay, or defraud a known creditor by                           transferring the assets to the trust                                  iv   there are no pending or threatened court actions against the settlor, except for those                           court actions identified by the settlor on an attachment to the affidavit                                  v   the settlor is not involved in any administrative proceedings, except those                           administrative proceedings identified on an attachment to the affidavit                                  vi   at the time of the transfer of the assets to the trust, the settlor is not in default of a                           child support obligation                                  vii   the settlor does not contemplate filing for relief under the provisions of the                           Bankruptcy Code  and                                 viii   the assets being transferred to the trust were not derived from unlawful activities.                                     Failure to satisfy the requirements of Subsection     shall result in the                           consequences described in this Subsection    .                                    a   If any requirement of either Subsection     a  or Subsection     b  is not satisfied,                           none of the property held in the trust will have the benefit of the protections described in                           Subsection     during the period that the requirement is not satisfied.                                 b   If any requirement of Subsection     c ,  d ,  e ,  f , or  g  is not satisfied, none of                           the property held in the trust will at any time have the benefit of the protections described in                           Subsection    .                                 c   If the requirement of Subsection     h  is not satisfied, none of the property held in                           the trust will have the benefit of the protections described in Subsection     with respect to the                           judgment or order referred to in Subsection    .                                 d   If any requirement set forth in Subsection     i ,  j ,  k ,  l ,  m , or  n  is not                           satisfied, the property transferred to the trust that does not satisfy the requirement may not have                           the benefit of the protections described in Subsection    .

If a trust instrument contains the transfer restrictions described in Subsections                               c ,  d ,  e , and  g , the transfer restrictions prevent a creditor or other person from asserting                           any cause of action or claim for relief against a trustee of the trust or against others involved in                           the counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of the trust for conspiracy to                           commit fraudulent conveyance, aiding and abetting a fraudulent conveyance, participation in                           the trust transaction, or similar cause of action or claim for relief.
