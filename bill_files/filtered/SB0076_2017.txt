Highlighted Provisions             This bill                   modifies the requirements to obtain postconviction DNA testing by providing that       the new evidence shall establish by a reasonable probability that the petitioner       would not have been convicted, or would have received a lesser sentence, rather       than requiring that the evidence will establish factual innocence  and                  provides that after the Utah attorney general responds to a petition for       postconviction DNA testing, the petitioner may reply to the attorney general s       response before the court makes a determination regarding allowing the testing.

Section   B       is amended to read               B      . Postconviction testing of DNA    Petition    Sufficient allegations          Notification of victim.                 As used in this part              a    DNA  means deoxyribonucleic acid.             b    Factually innocent  has the same definition as in Section   B      .                 A person convicted of a felony offense may at any time file a petition for       postconviction DNA testing in the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction if the       person asserts factual innocence under oath and the petition alleges              a   evidence has been obtained regarding the person s case which is still in existence       and is in a condition that allows DNA testing to be conducted              b   the chain of custody is sufficient to establish that the evidence has not been altered       in any material aspect              c   the person identifies the specific evidence to be tested and states a theory of       defense, not inconsistent with theories previously asserted at trial, that the requested DNA       testing would support              d   the evidence was not previously subjected to DNA testing, or if the evidence was       tested previously, the evidence was not subjected to the testing that is now requested, and the       new testing may resolve an issue not resolved by the prior testing              e   the proposed DNA testing is generally accepted as valid in the scientific field or is       otherwise admissible under Utah law              f   the evidence that is the subject of the request for testing              i   has the potential to produce new, noncumulative evidence  that will establish the       person s factual innocence   and             ii   there is a reasonable probability that the defendant would not have been convicted       or would have received a lesser sentence if the evidence had been presented at the original trial        and             g   the person is aware of the consequences of filing the petition, including              i   those specified in Sections   B       and   B        and             ii   that the person is waiving any statute of limitations in all jurisdictions as to any       felony offense the person has committed which is identified through DNA database       comparison.                 The petition under Subsection     shall comply with Rule   C, Utah Rules of Civil       Procedure, including providing the underlying criminal case number.                 The court may not order DNA testing in cases in which DNA testing was available       at the time of trial and the person did not request DNA testing or present DNA evidence for       tactical reasons.                 After a petition is filed under this section, prosecutors, law enforcement officers,       and crime laboratory personnel have a duty to cooperate in preserving evidence and in       determining the sufficiency of the chain of custody of the evidence which may be subject to       DNA testing.                 a   A person who files a petition under this section shall serve notice upon the       office of the prosecutor who obtained the conviction, and upon the Utah attorney general.  The       attorney general shall, within    days after receipt of service of a copy of the petition, or within       any additional period of time the court allows, answer or otherwise respond to all proceedings       initiated under this part.             b   After the attorney general  is given an opportunity to respond to a petition for       postconviction DNA testing,  responds under Subsection     a , the petitioner has the right to       reply to the response of the attorney general.             c   After the attorney general and the petitioner have filed a response and reply in       compliance with Subsection     b , the court shall order DNA testing if it finds by a       preponderance of the evidence that all criteria of Subsection     have been met.                 a   If the court grants the petition for testing, the DNA test shall be performed by       the Utah State Crime Laboratory within the Criminal Investigations and Technical Services       Division created in Section          , unless the person establishes that the state crime       laboratory has a conflict of interest or does not have the capability to perform the necessary       testing.             b   If the court orders that the testing be conducted by any laboratory other than the       state crime laboratory, the court shall require that the testing be performed              i   under reasonable conditions designed to protect the state s interests in the integrity       of the evidence  and             ii   according to accepted scientific standards and procedures.                 a   DNA testing under this section shall be paid for from funds appropriated to the       Department of Public Safety under Subsection              d  ii  from the DNA Specimen       Restricted Account created in Section           if              i   the court ordered the DNA testing under this section              ii   the Utah State Crime Laboratory within the Criminal Investigations and Technical       Services Division has a conflict of interest or does not have the capability to perform the       necessary testing  and             iii   the petitioner who has filed for postconviction DNA testing under Section         B       is serving a sentence of imprisonment and is indigent.             b   Under this Subsection    , costs of DNA testing include those necessary to        transport the evidence, prepare samples for analysis, analyze the evidence, and prepare reports        of findings.                  If the person is serving a sentence of imprisonment and is indigent, the state shall        pay for the costs of the testing under this part, but if the result is not favorable to the person the        court may order the person to reimburse the state for the costs of the testing, pursuant to the        provisions of Subsections   B          and   B          b .                   Any victim of the crime regarding which the person petitions for DNA testing,        who has elected to receive notice under Section         shall be notified by the state s attorney        of any hearing regarding the petition and testing, even though the hearing is a civil proceeding.
