Section          .  is amended to read                         . .  Actions related to improvements in real property.                   As used in this section                a    Action  means any claim for judicial, arbitral, or administrative relief for acts, errors,          omissions, or breach of duty that causes injury to persons or property, whether based in tort,          contract, warranty, strict liability, indemnity, contribution, or other source of law   .               b    Completion of improvement,  except as provided in Subsection     c  ii , means the          date of substantial completion of an improvement to real property as established by the earliest of                i   a Certificate of Substantial Completion ,                 ii  a Certificate of Occupancy issued by a governing agency ,   or               iii   the date of first use or possession of the improvement , whichever is earliest  .               c    Improvement  means any building, structure, infrastructure, road, utility, or other          similar man made change, addition, modification, or alteration to real property   .               d    Person  means an individual, corporation, partnership, joint venture, association,           proprietorship, or any other legal or governmental entity   and .              e    Provider  means any person contributing to, providing, or performing studies, plans,         specifications, drawings, designs, value engineering, cost or quantity estimates,  topographic          surveys, staking, construction, and the review, observation, administration, management,         supervision, inspections, and tests of construction for or in relation to an improvement.                  The Legislature finds that               a   exposing a provider to suits and liability for acts, errors, omissions, or breach of duty         after the possibility of injury or damage has become highly remote and unexpectedly creates costs         and hardships to the provider and the citizens of the state                b   these costs and hardships include liability insurance costs, records storage costs, undue          and unlimited liability risks during the life of both a provider and an improvement, and difficulties          in defending against claims many years after completion of an improvement                c   these costs and hardships constitute clear social and economic evils                d   the possibility of injury and damage becomes highly remote and unexpected as to          claims for breach of contract or warranty six years following completion of the improvement or          the abandonment of construction and, as to all other claims, ten years following completion or          abandonment                e   it is in the best interests of the citizens of the state to impose the periods of repose          provided in this chapter  and               f   it is in the best interests of the citizens of this state to impose a period of limitation          requiring that an action against a provider be brought within a two year period following discovery          of the act, error, omission, or breach of duty that forms the basis of the action.                   a   An action against a provider shall be commenced within two years from the date          of discovery of the act, error, omission, or breach of duty or the date upon which the act, error,          omission, or breach of duty should have been discovered through reasonable diligence.               b   If the act, error, omission, or breach of duty is discovered or discoverable before          completion of the improvement or abandonment of construction, the two year period begins to run          upon completion or abandonment.               c   If the action is based upon a survey                i   the date on which the map of the survey was filed in the county surveyor s office under          Section          is the date of discovery  and                      ii    completion of the improvement  means the date the map of the survey is filed under         Section          with respect to the real property.                  Subject to Subsection    , no action for breach of contract or warranty may be         commenced against a provider more than six years after completion of the improvement or         abandonment of construction.  In the event the act, error, omission, or breach of duty is discovered         in the sixth year of the six year period, the injured person has two additional years from the date         of discovery to commence an action.                  Subject to Subsections     and    , no action may be commenced against a provider         more than    years after completion of the improvement or abandonment of construction.  In the          event the act, error, omission, or breach of duty is discovered in the twelfth year of the    year          period, the injured person shall have two additional years from the date of discovery to commence          an action.                   Subsections     and     do not apply to an action against a provider                a   who has fraudulently concealed the act, error, omission, or breach of duty                b   for a willful or intentional act, error, omission, or breach of duty  or               c   for breach of a written express warranty where the warranty period extends beyond six          years as provided in Subsection    .                   If a person otherwise entitled to bring an action did not commence the action within          the periods prescribed by Subsections     and     solely because that person was a minor or          mentally incompetent and without a legal guardian, that person shall have two years from the date          the disability is removed to commence the action.                   The time limitation imposed by this section shall not apply to any action against any          person in actual possession or control of the improvement as owner, tenant, or otherwise, at the          time any defective or unsafe condition of the improvement proximately causes the injury for which          the action is brought.                   This section does not extend the period of limitation or repose otherwise prescribed          by law or a valid and enforceable contract.                    This section applies to all claims and causes of action that accrue after April   ,     ,          notwithstanding that the act, error, omission, or breach of duty occurred, or the improvement was          completed or abandoned before April   ,     .
