If, following the shelter hearing, the child is placed with a person who is not a                            parent of the child, a relative of the child, a friend of a parent of the child, or a former foster                            parent of the child, priority shall be given to a foster placement with a man and a woman who                            are married to each other, unless it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with a                            single foster parent.                                      In determining the placement of a child, neither the court, nor the division, may                            take into account, or discriminate against, the religion of a person with whom the child may be                            placed, unless the purpose of taking religion into account is to place the child with a person or                            family of the same religion as the child.

For purposes of Subsection    , parent time is in the best interests of a minor unless                            the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to                                  a   protect the physical safety of the minor                                  b   protect the life of the minor  or                                 c   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the                               minor s fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.

Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period                            described in Subsections      through      does not interrupt the running of the period.                                      a   If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted                            by the court in accordance with Section       A           at the expiration of the time period for                            reunification services.                                 b   The permanency hearing shall be held no later than    months after the original                            removal of the minor.                                 c   If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted                            within    days, in accordance with Section       A          .                                      With regard to a minor who is    months of age or younger at the time the minor                            is initially removed from the home, the court shall                                  a   hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,                            pursuant to Section       A            and                                 b   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                            removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                            to comply with the child and family plan.
