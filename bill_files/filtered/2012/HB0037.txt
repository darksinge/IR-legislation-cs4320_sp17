  The guidelines in this chapter apply to any judicial or administrative order                           establishing or modifying an award of child support entered on or after July

                          b   The rebuttable presumption means the provisions and considerations required by                           the guidelines  the award amounts resulting from the application of the guidelines  and the use                           of worksheets consistent with these guidelines are presumed to be correct  unless rebutted                           under the provisions of this section                                     A written finding or specific finding on the record supporting the conclusion that                           complying with a provision of the guidelines or ordering an award amount resulting from use                           of the guidelines would be unjust  inappropriate  or not in the best interest of a child in a                           particular case is sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case   If an order rebuts the                           presumption through findings  it is considered a deviated order                                     The following shall be considered deviations from the guidelines  if                                 a   the order includes a written finding that it is a deviation from the

as to the reason  or                                c   the deviation is made because there were more children than provided for in the                           guidelines table                                     If the amount in the order and the amount on the guidelines worksheet differ by                               or more                                 a   the order is considered deviated  and                                b   the incomes listed on the worksheet may not be used in adjusting support for                           emancipation                                        a

            ii   by giving credit to the obligee for a present family  the obligation of the obligor                          would increase                                  b   Additional worksheets

                       be applied to mitigate an increase in the award but may not be applied                                 a   for the benefit of the obligee if the credit would increase the support obligation of                           the obligor from the most recent order  or                                b   for the benefit of the obligor if the amount of support received by the obligee would                           be decreased from the most recent order                                     a   If a child support order has not been issued or modified within the previous
