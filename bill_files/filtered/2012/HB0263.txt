for an employee who receives unemployment benefits after voluntarily                           leaving employment to follow a spouse because of a spouse s military assignment                                     authorizes unemployment benefits for a claimant who voluntarily leaves                           employment to follow a spouse to a new location if                                         the claimant s spouse is a member of the United States armed forces and the                           claimant s spouse has been relocated by a military assignment on active duty                                         it is impractical for the claimant to commute to the previous work from the new                           locality  and                                        the claimant otherwise meets and follows the eligibility and reporting                           requirements of the Unemployment Division  and                                    makes technical changes

as follows                                 a   Benefit costs of an individual will not be charged to a base period employer  but                           will be considered social costs if the individual s separation from that employer occurred under                           any of the following circumstances                                 i   the individual was discharged by the employer

          b   Social costs are benefit costs which are or have been charged to employers who                           have terminated coverage and are no longer liable for contributions  less the

whose benefit ratio                           exceeds the maximum overall contribution rate and the amount determined by multiplying the                           taxable payroll of the same employers by the maximum overall contribution rate is a social                              cost                                 d   Benefit costs attributable to a concurrent base period employer will not be charged                           to that employer if the individual s customary hours of work for that employer have not been                           reduced                                 e

consider for the purposes of this chapter the reasonableness of the claimant s actions  and the                           extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing attachment to the

         d    Notwithstanding any other subsection of this section  Except as provided in                          Subsection     e   a claimant who has left work voluntarily to accompany    or follow

     e   A claimant who has left work voluntarily to accompany or follow the claimant s                           spouse to a new locality does so with good cause for purposes of this Subsection     and is                           eligible to receive benefits if                                  i   the claimant s spouse is a member of the United States armed forces and the                           claimant s spouse has been relocated by a full time assignment scheduled to last at least                               days while on                                  A   active duty as defined in

determined by the division for the claimant to commute to the                           previous work from the new locality                                  iii   the claimant left work voluntarily no

the eligibility and reporting requirements                           of this chapter  including registering for work with the division or  if the claimant has relocated                           to another state  the equivalent agency of that state                                      a   For the week in which the claimant was discharged for just cause or for an act or

division  and                            thereafter until the claimant has earned an amount equal to at least six times the claimant s                            weekly benefit amount in bona fide covered employment                                  b   For the week in which the claimant was discharged for dishonesty constituting a                            crime or any felony or class A misdemeanor in connection with the claimant s work as shown                               by the facts  together with the claimant s admission  or as shown by the claimant s conviction of                            that crime in a court of competent jurisdiction and for the    next following weeks                                  c   Wage credits shall be deleted from the claimant s base period  and are not available                            for this or any subsequent claim for benefits                                      a   i   If the division finds that the claimant has failed without good cause to                            properly apply for available suitable work  to accept a referral to suitable work offered by the                            employment office  or to accept

circumstances where it would be contrary to                            equity and good conscience to impose a disqualification                                  ii   The division shall consider the purposes of this chapter  the reasonableness of the                            claimant s actions  and the extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing                            attachment to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a                            claimant is contrary to equity and good conscience                                  c   In determining whether work is suitable for an individual  the division shall                            consider the                                  i   degree of risk involved to his health

considered on the basis of all four quarters used in                            establishing eligibility and not just the earnings from the most recent employer   The division                            shall be more prone to find work as suitable the longer the claimant has been unemployed and                            the less likely the prospects are to secure local work in his customary occupation                                     e   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter  no work is suitable  and                            benefits may not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing                            to accept new work under any of the following conditions                                  i   if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike  lockout  or other labor                            dispute                                  ii   if the wages  hours  or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less                            favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality  or                                 iii   if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a                            company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization                                      For any week in which the division finds that the claimant s unemployment is due                            to a stoppage of work that exists because of a strike involving the claimant s grade  class  or                            group of workers at the factory or establishment at which the claimant is or was last employed                                  a   If the division finds that a strike has been fomented by a worker of any employer                             none of the workers of the grade  class  or group of workers of the individual who is found to                            be a party to the plan  or agreement to foment a strike  shall be eligible for benefits   However                             if the division finds that the strike is caused by the failure or refusal of any employer to                            conform to any law of the state or of the United States pertaining to hours  wages  or other                            conditions of work  the strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits                                  b   If the division finds that the employer  the employer s agent or representative has                            conspired  planned  or agreed with any of the employer s workers  their agents or                            representatives to foment a strike  that strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits                                  c   A worker may receive benefits if  subsequent to the worker s unemployment                            because of a strike as defined in this Subsection
