factual innocence under oath by the                           petitioner  and shall aver  with supporting affidavits or other credible documents  that                                 i   newly

knew of the evidence at the time of                           trial or sentencing or in time to include the evidence in any previously filed post trial motion or                           postconviction motion  and the evidence could not have been discovered by the petitioner or                           the petitioner s counsel through the exercise of reasonable diligence  or                                ii   a court has found ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to exercise reasonable                              diligence in uncovering the evidence                                 b   Upon entry of a finding that the petition is sufficient under Subsection     a   the                           court shall then review the petition to determine if Subsection     a  has been satisfied   If the                           court finds that the requirements of Subsection     a  have not been satisfied  it may dismiss                           the petition without

                     requirements of Subsection     a  are waived in the interest of justice                                     If the conviction for which the petitioner asserts factual innocence was based upon                           a plea of guilty  the petition shall contain the specific nature and content of the evidence that                           establishes factual innocence   The court shall review the evidence and may dismiss the petition                           at any time in the course of the proceedings  if the court finds that the evidence of factual                           innocence relies solely upon the recantation of testimony or prior statements made by a witness                           against the petitioner  and the recantation appears to the court to be equivocal or self serving                                     A person who has already obtained postconviction relief that vacated or reversed                           the person s conviction or

relitigating facts  issues  or evidence presented in                           previous proceedings or presenting issues that appear frivolous or speculative on their face  the                           court shall dismiss the petition  state the basis for the dismissal  and serve notice of dismissal                              upon the petitioner and the attorney general   If  upon completion of the initial review  the court                           does not dismiss the petition  it shall order the attorney general to file a response to the petition                             The attorney

the court shall order a hearing if it finds the petition meets the requirements of                           Subsections     and     and finds there is a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence                           regarding the charges of which the petitioner was convicted   No bona fide and compelling                           issue of factual innocence exists if the petitioner is merely relitigating facts  issues  or evidence                            presented in a previous proceeding or if the petitioner is unable to identify with sufficient                            specificity the nature and reliability of the newly discovered evidence that establishes the                            petitioner s factual innocence                                  d   If the parties stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually                            innocent  the court may find the petitioner is factually innocent without holding a hearing   If                           the state will not stipulate that the evidence establishes that the petitioner is factually innocent                            no determination of factual innocence may be made by the court without first holding a hearing                           under this part                                       The court may not grant a petition for a hearing under this part during the period                            in which criminal proceedings in the matter are pending before any trial or appellate court                             unless stipulated
