exploited the child  that fact                            constitutes prima facie evidence that there is a substantial risk that the child will be physically                            abused  sexually abused  or sexually exploited                                       a   i   The court shall also make a determination on the record as to whether                            reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from the                            child s home and whether there are available services that would prevent the need for continued                            removal                                  ii   If the court finds that the child can be safely returned to the custody of the child s                            parent or guardian through the provision of those services  the court shall place the child with                            the child s parent or guardian and order that those services be provided by the division                                     b   In making the determination described in Subsection      a   and in ordering and                            providing services  the child s health

occurred during an emergency                            situation in which the child could not safely remain at home  the court shall make a finding that                            any lack of preplacement preventive efforts was appropriate                                       In cases where actual sexual abuse  sexual exploitation  abandonment  severe                            abuse  or

home  the court shall                            state the facts on which that decision is based                                       If the court finds that continued removal and temporary custody are necessary for                            the protection of a child because harm may result to the child if the child were returned home                             the court shall order continued removal regardless of                                  a   any error in the initial removal of the child                                  b   the failure of a party to comply with notice provisions

          Subject to Subsections     and      if the court determines that reunification                            services are appropriate for the minor and the minor s family  the court shall provide for                            reasonable parent time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed                             unless parent time is not in the best interest of the minor                                      In cases where obvious sexual abuse  sexual exploitation  abandonment  severe                            abuse  or severe neglect are

of a minor unless                            the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent time in order to                                  a   protect the physical safety of the minor                                  b   protect the life of the minor  or                                 c   prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the

time based solely on a                            parent s failure to                                  a   prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances  or

                       goal                                      A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection                               A              b  within    days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if                            something other than reunification is initially established as a minor s primary permanency                            goal                                       a   The court may amend a minor s primary permanency goal before the                               establishment of a final permanency plan under Section       A                                            b   The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event                            that the primary permanency goal is abandoned                                  c   If  at any time  the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor s primary                            permanency goal  the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section                               A           on or before the earlier of                                  i      days after the day on which the

time period is                            extended under Subsection       A                                               b   Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an

eight months after the date of the initial removal                             pursuant to Section       A            and                                 b   order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial                            removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts                            to comply with the child and family plan                                       With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are                            ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six                            months from the date that reunification services were ordered                                  a   the court shall terminate reunification services  and                                 b   the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights                                       When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section                               A            the court shall attempt to keep the minor s sibling group together if keeping the                            sibling group together is                                  a   practicable  and                                    b   in accordance with the best interest of the minor                                       a   Because of the state s interest in and responsibility to protect and provide                            permanency for minors who are abused  neglected  or dependent  the Legislature finds that a                            parent s interest in receiving reunification services is limited                                  b   The court may determine that                                  i   efforts to reunify a minor with the minor s family are not reasonable or appropriate                             based on the individual circumstances  and                                 ii   reunification services should not be provided                                  c   In determining  reasonable efforts  to be made with respect to a minor  and in                            making  reasonable efforts   the minor s health  safety  and welfare shall be the paramount                            concern                                        There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a                             parent if the court finds  by clear and convincing evidence  that any of the following                             circumstances exist                                   a   the whereabouts of the parents are unknown  based upon a verified affidavit                             indicating that a reasonably diligent

that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services                                   c   the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse
