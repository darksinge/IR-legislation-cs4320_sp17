In a condominium, a declaration, or an amendment to a declaration, adding units                           may not be recorded unless all structural components and mechanical systems of all buildings                           containing or comprising any units thereby created are substantially completed in accordance                           with the plans, as evidenced by a recorded certificate of completion executed by an                           independent engineer, surveyor, or architect.                                Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                     a    .  Unit boundaries.

If any chute, flue, duct, wire, conduit, bearing wall, bearing column, or any other                           fixture lies partially within and partially outside the designated boundaries of a unit, any                           portion thereof serving only that unit is a limited common element allocated solely to that unit,                              and any portion thereof serving more than one unit or any portion of the common elements is a                           part of the common elements.                                     Subject to Subsection    , all spaces, interior partitions, and other fixtures and                           improvements within the boundaries of a unit are a part of the unit.                                     Any shutters, awnings, window boxes, doorsteps, stoops, porches, balconies,                           patios, and all exterior doors and windows or other fixtures designed to serve a single unit, but                           located outside the unit s boundaries, are limited common elements allocated exclusively to                           that unit.

All provisions of the declaration and bylaws are severable.                                     The rule against perpetuities does not apply to defeat any provision of the                           declaration, bylaws, rules, or regulations adopted pursuant to Subsection         a            a .                                     In the event of a conflict between the provisions of the declaration and the bylaws,                           the declaration prevails except to the extent the declaration is inconsistent with this chapter.                                     Title to a unit and common elements is not rendered unmarketable or otherwise                           affected by reason of an insubstantial failure of the declaration to comply with this chapter.                            Whether a substantial failure impairs marketability is not affected by this chapter.                                Section   .

Any lease the expiration or termination of which may terminate the common                           interest community or reduce its size, or a memorandum thereof, must be recorded.  Every                           lessor of those leases in a condominium or planned community shall sign the declaration.  The                           declaration must state                                  a   the recording data for the lease or a statement of where the complete lease may be                           inspected                                  b   the date on which the lease is scheduled to expire                                  c   a legally sufficient description of the real estate subject to the lease                                  d   any right of the unit owners to redeem the reversion and the manner whereby those                           rights may be exercised, or a statement that they do not have those rights                                  e   any right of the unit owners to remove any improvements within a reasonable time                           after the expiration or termination of the lease, or a statement that they do not have those rights                               and                                 f   any rights of the unit owners to renew the lease and the conditions of any renewal,                           or a statement that they do not have those rights.                                     After the declaration for a leasehold condominium or leasehold planned community                           is recorded, neither the lessor nor the lessor s successor in interest may terminate the leasehold                           interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of a unit owner s share of the rent and                           otherwise complies with all covenants which, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate                           the lease.  A unit owner s leasehold interest in a condominium or planned community is not                           affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant.                                     Acquisition of the leasehold interest of any unit owner by the owner of the                           reversion or remainder does not merge the leasehold and fee simple interests unless the                           leasehold interests of all unit owners subject to that reversion or remainder are acquired.                                     If the expiration or termination of a lease decreases the number of units in a                           common interest community, the allocated interests must be reallocated in accordance with                           Subsection         a            as if those units had been taken by eminent domain.  Reallocations                           must be confirmed by an amendment to the declaration prepared, executed, and recorded by the                           association.                                Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                     a    .  Allocation of allocated interests.                                     The declaration must allocate to each unit                                  a   in a condominium, a fraction or percentage of undivided interests in the common                           elements and in the common expenses of the association, and a portion of the votes in the                           association                                  b   in a cooperative, an ownership interest in the association, a fraction or percentage                           of the common expenses of the association, and a portion of the votes in the association  and                                 c   in a planned community, a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the                           association, and a portion of the votes in the association.                                     The declaration must state the formulas used to establish allocations of interests.                            Those allocations may not discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant or an affiliate                           of the declarant.                                     If units may be added to or withdrawn from the common interest community, the                              declaration must state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among all                           units included in the common interest community after the addition or withdrawal.                                     a   The declaration may provide                                  i   that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units on particular matters                           specified in the declaration                                  ii   for cumulative voting only for the purpose of electing members of the executive                           board  and                                 iii   for class voting on specified issues affecting the class if necessary to protect valid                           interests of the class.                                 b   A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading                           any limitation imposed on declarants by this chapter nor may units constitute a class because                           they are owned by a declarant.                                     Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense                           liabilities and, in a condominium, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elements                           allocated at any time to all the units must each equal one if stated as a fraction or      if                           stated as a percentage.  In the event of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the result                           derived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.                                     In a condominium, the common elements are not subject to partition, and any                           purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of                           an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is                           allocated is void.                                     In a cooperative, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other                           voluntary or involuntary transfer of an ownership interest in the association made without the                           possessory interest in the unit to which that interest is related is void.                                Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                     a    .  Limited common elements.                                     Except for the limited common elements described in Subsections         a                                      and    , the declaration must specify to which unit or units each limited common element is                           allocated.  An allocation may not be altered without the consent of the unit owners whose units                           are affected.

The declarant is the unit                           owner of any units thereby created.  The amendment to the declaration must assign an                           identifying number to each new unit created, and, except in the case of subdivision or                           conversion of units described in Subsection    , reallocate the allocated interests among all                           units.  The amendment must describe any common elements and any limited common elements                           thereby created and, in the case of limited common elements, designate the unit to which each                           is allocated to the extent required by Section         a        .

If the owners of the adjoining units                           have specified a reallocation between their units of their allocated interests, the application                              must state the proposed reallocations.  Unless the executive board determines, within    days,                           that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association shall prepare an amendment that                           identifies the units involved and states the reallocations.

The                           amendment must provide reasonable protection for a use or occupancy permitted at the time                           the amendment was adopted.                                     The time limits specified in the declaration pursuant to Subsection         a            h                            within which reserved development rights must be exercised may be extended, and additional                           development rights may be created, if persons entitled to cast at least     of the votes in the                           association, including     of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree to                           that action.

Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                     a    .  Termination of common interest community.                                     Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain or in the case of                           foreclosure against an entire cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the                           declaration, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unit                           owners of units to which at least     of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger                           percentage the declaration specifies.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if                           all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.                                     An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination                           agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of                           unit owners.  The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be                           void unless it is recorded before that date.  A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof                           must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is                           situated and is effective only upon recordation.                                     In the case of a condominium or planned community containing only units having                           horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that                           all of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be sold                              following termination.  If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interest                           community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the                           minimum terms of the sale.                                     In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units not                           having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may                           provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold following                           termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all the unit                           owners consent to the sale.                                     The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real                           estate in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until                           approved pursuant to Subsections     and    .  If any real estate is to be sold following                           termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the                           holders of all interests in the units.  Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and                           appropriate to effect the sale.  Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof                           distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination.                            Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may                           appear, in accordance with Subsections    ,    , and     .  Unless otherwise specified in the                           termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner                           and the unit owner s successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion                           of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.  During the period of that occupancy, each                           unit owner and the unit owner s successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and                           other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.                                     In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate constituting the                           common interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common                           elements and, in a common interest community containing only units having horizontal                           boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the common interest                           community, vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to                           their respective interests as provided in Subsection     , and liens on the units shift                           accordingly.  While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the unit owner s                           successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that                           formerly constituted the unit.                                        Following termination of the common interest community, the proceeds of any sale                           of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee                           for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.                                     Following termination of a condominium or planned community, creditors of the                           association holding liens on the units, which were recorded before termination, may enforce                           those liens in the same manner as any lien holder.  All other creditors of the association are to                           be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.                                     a   In a cooperative, the declaration may provide that all creditors of the association                           have priority over any interests of unit owners and creditors of unit owners.  In that event,                           following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which were                           recorded before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lien holder, and                           any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against the                           cooperative immediately before termination.  Unless the declaration provides that all creditors                           of the association have that priority                                  i   the lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against the                           association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each unit owner s                           interest in the unit as of the date the lien was perfected                                  ii   any other creditor of the association is to be treated upon termination as if the                           creditor had perfected a lien against each unit owner s interest immediately before termination                                  iii   the amount of the lien of an association s creditor described in Subsections     a  i                            and  b  against each of the unit owners  interest must be proportionate to the ratio which each                           unit s common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the units                                  iv   the lien of each creditor of each unit owner which was perfected before termination                           continues as a lien against that unit owner s unit as of the date the lien was perfected  and                                 v   the assets of the association must be distributed to all unit owners and all lien                           holders as their interests may appear in the order described above.                                 b    Creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any unit owner in                           excess of the amount of the creditor s lien against that unit owner s interest.                                      The respective interests of unit owners referred to in Subsections     through                               are as follows                                  a   Except as provided in Subsection      b , the respective interests of unit owners are                              the fair market values of their units, allocated interests, and any limited common elements                           immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers                           selected by the association.  The decision of the independent appraisers must be distributed to                           the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within    days after distribution by unit                           owners of units to which     of the votes in the association are allocated.  The proportion of                           any unit owner s interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market                           value of that unit owner s unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all the                           units and their allocated interests.                                 b   If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an                           appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all                           unit owners are                                   i   in a condominium, their respective common element interests immediately before                            the termination                                   ii   in a cooperative, their respective ownership interests immediately before the                            termination  and                                  iii   in a planned community, their respective common expense liabilities immediately                            before the termination.                                       In a condominium or planned community, except as provided in Subsection     ,                            foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interest                            community does not terminate, of itself, the common interest community, and foreclosure or                            enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community,                            other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the common interest                            community.  Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real                            estate, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the                            association under Section         a        , does not withdraw, of itself, that real estate from the                            common interest community, but the person taking title thereto may require from the                            association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the common interest                            community.                                       In a condominium or planned community, if a lien or encumbrance against a                            portion of the real estate comprising the common interest community has priority over the                            declaration and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing                               the lien or encumbrance, upon foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real estate                            subject to that lien or encumbrance from the common interest community.

If a tenant of a unit owner violates the declaration, bylaws, or rules and regulations                            of the association, in addition to exercising any of its powers against the unit owner, the                            association may                                   a   exercise directly against the tenant the powers described in Subsection     k                                    b   after giving notice to the tenant and the unit owner and an opportunity to be heard,                            levy reasonable fines against the tenant for the violation  and                                  c   enforce any other rights against the tenant for the violation which the unit owner as                            landlord could lawfully have exercised under the lease or which the association could lawfully                            have exercised directly against the unit owner, or both.                                      The rights granted under Subsection     c  may only be exercised if the tenant or                            unit owner fails to cure the violation within ten days after the association notifies the tenant and                            unit owner of that violation.

Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                      a    .  Executive board members and officers.                                      Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, Subsection    , or other                            provisions of this chapter, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the                            association.  In the performance of their duties, officers and members of the executive board                            appointed by the declarant shall exercise the degree of care and loyalty required of a trustee.                             Officers and members of the executive board not appointed by the declarant shall exercise the                            degree of care and loyalty required of an officer or director of a corporation organized under                            Title   , Chapter  a, Utah Revised Nonprofit Corporation Act.                                         The executive board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the                            declaration, to terminate the common interest community, or to elect members of the executive                            board or determine the qualifications, powers and duties, or terms of office of executive board                            members, but the executive board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired                            portion of any term.                                      Within    days after adoption of any proposed budget for the common interest                            community, the executive board shall provide a summary of the budget to all the unit owners,                            and shall set a date for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget not                            less than    nor more than    days after mailing of the summary.  Unless at that meeting a                            majority of all unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration reject the budget, the                            budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present.  In the event the proposed budget is                            rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the unit owners must be continued until such time                            as the unit owners ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the executive board.                                      a   Subject to Subsection    , the declaration may provide for a period of declarant                            control of the association, during which a declarant, or persons designated by him, may appoint                            and remove the officers and members of the executive board.

Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                      a    .  Transfer of special declarant rights.                                      A special declarant right created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred                            only by an instrument evidencing the transfer recorded in every county in which any portion of                            the common interest community is located.  The instrument is not effective unless executed by                            the transferee.

Lack of privity                            does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of                            the transferor.                                  b   If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the                            transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of                            the successor relating to the common interest community.                                  c   If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special                            declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for                               any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration                            relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising after the transfer.                                  d   A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual                            or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor                            declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor.

Each unit owner shall afford to the association and the other unit owners, and to                            their agents or employees, access through his unit reasonably necessary for those purposes.  If                            damage is inflicted on the common elements or on any unit through which access is taken, the                            unit owner responsible for the damage, or the association if it is responsible, is liable for the                            prompt repair thereof.

Unless the declaration provides otherwise, any                            income or proceeds from real estate subject to development rights inures to the declarant.                                      In a planned community, if all development rights have expired with respect to any                            real estate, the declarant remains liable for all expenses of that real estate unless, upon                            expiration, the declaration provides that the real estate becomes common elements or units.

If more than one of the owners                            are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement                            of a majority in interest of the owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise.                             There is majority agreement if any one of the owners casts the votes allocated to that unit                            without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the                            other owners of the unit.                                      Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit                            owner.  If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register                            protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.  A                            unit owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of                            revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association.  A proxy is void if it is not                            dated or purports to be revocable without notice.  A proxy terminates one year after its date,                            unless it specifies a shorter term.                                      a   If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the common                            interest community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units                                   i   the provisions of Subsections     and     apply to lessees as if they were unit                            owners                                   ii   unit owners who have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on                               those specified matters  and                                  iii   lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights                            respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.                                  b   Unit owners must also be given notice, in the manner provided in Section                                   a        , of all meetings at which lessees are entitled to vote.

In a condominium or planned community, portions of the common elements may                            be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at                            least     of the votes in the association, including     of the votes allocated to units not                            owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action                             but all owners of units to which any limited common element is allocated must agree in order                            to convey that limited common element or subject it to a security interest.  The declaration may                            specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential                            uses.  Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association, but the proceeds of the sale of limited                            common elements must be distributed equitably among the owners of units to which the                            limited common elements were allocated.                                      Part of a cooperative may be conveyed and all or part of a cooperative may be                            subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least     of the                            votes in the association, including     of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant,                            or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action  but, if fewer than all of                            the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest,                            then all unit owners of those units, or the units to which those limited common elements are                            allocated, must agree in order to convey those units or limited common elements or subject                            them to a security interest.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the                            units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.  Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the                            association.  Any purported conveyance or other voluntary transfer of an entire cooperative,                            unless made pursuant to Section         a        , is void.                                      An agreement to convey common elements in a condominium or planned                            community, or to subject them to a security interest, or in a cooperative, an agreement to                            convey any part of a cooperative or subject it to a security interest, must be evidenced by the                            execution of an agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the                            requisite number of unit owners.  The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement                            will be void unless recorded before that date.  The agreement and all ratifications thereof must                            be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is situated,                            and is effective only upon recordation.                                      The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract to convey an interest in                               a common interest community pursuant to Subsection    , but the contract is not enforceable                            against the association until approved pursuant to Subsections    ,    , and    .  Thereafter, the                            association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance,                            including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.                                      Unless made pursuant to this section, any purported conveyance, encumbrance,                            judicial sale, or other voluntary transfer of common elements or of any other part of a                            cooperative is void.                                      A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements or of a cooperative pursuant to                            this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support.                                      Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if the holders of first security interests                            on     of the units that are subject to security interests on the day the unit owners  agreement                            under Subsection     is recorded consent in writing                                   a   a conveyance of common elements pursuant to this section terminates both the                            undivided interests in those common elements allocated to the units and the security interests in                            those undivided interests held by all persons holding security interests in the units  and                                  b   an encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section has priority over all                            preexisting encumbrances on the undivided interests in those common elements held by all                            persons holding security interests in the units.                                      The consents by holders of first security interests on units described in Subsection                               , or a certificate of the secretary affirming that those consents have been received by the                            association, may be recorded at any time before the date on which the agreement under                            Subsection     becomes void.  Consents or certificates so recorded are valid from the date they                            are recorded for purposes of calculating the percentage of consenting first security interest                            holders, regardless of later sales or encumbrances on those units.  Even if the required                            percentage of first security interest holders so consent, a conveyance or encumbrance of                            common elements does not affect interests having priority over the declaration, or created by                            the association after the declaration was recorded.                                      In a cooperative, the association may acquire, hold, encumber, or convey a                            proprietary lease without complying with this section.

In the case of a building that is part of a cooperative or that contains units having                            horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, the insurance maintained under Subsection                                a , to the extent reasonably available, must include the units, but need not include                            improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.                                      If the insurance described in Subsections     and     is not reasonably available, the                            association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by                            United States mail to all unit owners.  The declaration may require the association to carry any                            other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it considers                            appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.                                      Insurance policies carried pursuant to Subsections     and     must provide that                                   a   each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability                            arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association                                   b   the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner                            or member of his household                                   c   no act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority                            on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy                             and                                     d   if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a                            unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association s policy provides                            primary insurance.                                      Any loss covered by the property policy under Subsections     a  and     must be                            adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any                            insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any                            holder of a security interest.  The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance                            proceeds in trust for the association, unit owners, and lien holders as their interests may appear.                             Subject to the provisions of Subsection    , the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair                            or restoration of the damaged property, and the association, unit owners, and lien holders are                            not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of                            proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored, or the common interest                            community is terminated.                                      An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from                            obtaining insurance for his own benefit.                                      An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue                            certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit                            owner or holder of a security interest.  The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse                            to renew it until    days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been                            mailed to the association, each unit owner and each holder of a security interest to whom a                            certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known                            addresses.                                      a   Any portion of the common interest community for which insurance is required                            under this section which is damaged or destroyed must be repaired or replaced promptly by the                            association unless                                   i   the common interest community is terminated, in which case Section         a                                   applies                                   ii   repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local statute or ordinance                            governing health or safety  or                                  iii       of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited                            common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.                                     b   The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a                            common expense.

Until the association makes a common expense assessment, the declarant shall pay                               all common expenses.  After an assessment has been made by the association, assessments                            must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association.                                      Except for assessments under Subsections    ,    , and    , all common expenses                            must be assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations set forth in the                            declaration pursuant to Subsections         a            and    .

Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against                            the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered, in                            proportion to their common expense liabilities.                                      If any common expense is caused by the misconduct of any unit owner, the                            association may assess that expense exclusively against his unit.                                      If common expense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and                            any installment thereof not yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated                            common expense liabilities.                                 Section   .    Section        a         is enacted to read                                      a    .  Lien for assessments.                                      The association has a statutory lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that                            unit or fines imposed against its unit owner.  Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees,                            charges, late charges, fines, and interest charged pursuant to Subsections         a            j                             through  l  are enforceable as assessments under this section.  If an assessment is payable in                            installments, the lien is for the full amount of the assessment from the time the first installment                            thereof becomes due.                                         a   A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit                            except                                   i   liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a                            cooperative, liens and encumbrances which the association creates, assumes, or takes subject                            to                                   ii   a first security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment                            sought to be enforced became delinquent, or, in a cooperative, the first security interest                            encumbering only the unit owner s interest and perfected before the date on which the                            assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent  and                                  iii   liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against                            the unit or cooperative.                                  b   The lien is also prior to all security interests described in Subsection     a  ii  to the                            extent of the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the                            association pursuant to Subsection         a            which would have become due in the absence                            of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce                            the lien.  This Subsection     does not affect the priority of mechanics  or materialmen s liens,                            or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.                                      Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens                            for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority.                                      Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien.                             No further recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.                                      A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien                            are instituted within three years after the full amount of the assessments becomes due.                                      This section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which Subsection                                creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.                                      A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section must include costs                            and reasonable attorney s fees for the prevailing party.                                      The association upon written request shall furnish to a unit owner a statement                            setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against the unit.  If the unit owner s interest is                            real estate, the statement must be in recordable form.  The statement must be furnished within                            ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive                               board, and every unit owner.                                      In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may                            be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a                            commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided by this section.

Every aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising, time, place, and terms                            must be reasonable.  The association shall give to the unit owner and any lessees of the unit                            owner reasonable written notice of the time and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is                            intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time after which a private                            disposition may be made.  The same notice must also be sent to any other person who has a                            recorded interest in the unit which would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest                            was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale                            or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may                            be made.  The notices required by this Subsection      may be sent to any address reasonable                            in the circumstances.  Sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice.

The amount of the                            payment must be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner s common expense liability                            bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien.                             After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner s unit for                            any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.                                  d   A judgment against the association must be indexed in the name of the common                            interest community and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the                            units.

Failure of the                               association to transmit the notice does not affect the validity of the foreclosure.                                  b   Whether or not a unit owner s unit is subject to the claims of the association s                            creditors, no other property of a unit owner is subject to those claims.
