Section         f         is amended to read                                      f    .  Purpose.                                    a   The Legislature recognizes that the growth of new industry and expansion of                           existing industry requires a strong technology base, new ideas, concepts, innovations, and                           prototypes.                                b   These generally come from strong research colleges and universities.                                c   Technical research in Utah s colleges and universities should be enhanced and                           expanded, particularly in those areas targeted by the state for economic development.                                d   Most states are enhancing their research base by direct funding, usually on a                           matching basis.                                e   The purpose of this part is to catalyze and enhance the growth of these technologies                           by encouraging interdisciplinary research activities in targeted areas.                                f   The Legislature recognizes that one source of funding is in matching state funds                           with federal funds and industrial support to provide the needed new technologies.                                    The Legislature recommends that the governor consider the allocation of economic                           development funds for Centers of Excellence to be matched by industry and federal grants on at                           least a two for one basis for colleges and universities in the state that offer any doctoral                          degrees.                                    a   The Legislature recommends that the funds be allocated on a competitive basis                           to the various colleges and universities in the state.                                b   The funds made available should be used to support interdisciplinary research in                           specialized Centers of Excellence in technologies that are considered to have potential for                           economic development in this state.
