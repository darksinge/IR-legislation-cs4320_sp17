Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody                           consideration.                                    If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is                           declared void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the                           minor children as it considers appropriate.                                a   In determining any form of custody, the court shall consider the best interests of the                           child  and, among other factors the court finds relevant, the following  .                                 i   the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties                                   ii   which parent is most likely to act in the best interest of the child, including                          allowing the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent                                   iii   the extent of bonding between the parent and child, meaning the depth, quality,                          and nature of the relationship between a parent and child  and                                  iv   those factors outlined in Section            .     .                                 b   The court shall, in every case,  consider joint custody but may award any form of                          custody which is determined to be  presume that joint legal and physical custody that                          designates equal parent time and equal custody between the parents of all minor children is in                          the best interest of the child.  The presumption of joint legal and physical custody may be                          rebutted by either party.  The party seeking to rebut the presumption shall bear the burden of                          proof that joint legal and physical custody is not in the best interest of the minor child.                                c   The children may not be required by either party to testify unless the trier of fact                           determines that extenuating circumstances exist that would necessitate the testimony of the                           children be heard and there is no other reasonable method to present their testimony.                                d   The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s                              desires regarding future custody or parent time schedules, but the expressed desires are not                           controlling and the court may determine the children s custody or parent time otherwise.  The                           desires of a child    years of age or older shall be given added weight, but is not the single                           controlling factor.                                e   If interviews with the children are conducted by the court pursuant to Subsection                               d , they shall be conducted by the judge in camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be                           obtained but is not necessary if the court finds that an interview with the children is the only                           method to ascertain the child s desires regarding custody.                                     In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds                          relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing                          the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds                          appropriate.                                           If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court                           shall take that evidence into consideration in determining  whether  how to award custody  to                          the other parent .                                          a   Except as provided in Subsection           b , a court may not discriminate                           against a parent due to a disability, as defined in Section                , in awarding custody or                           determining whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award                           of custody.                                b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining                           whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody,                           the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising from the                           disability by showing that                                 i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to                           provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or                                ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources                           available to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of                           the child at issue.                                c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under                           Title   B, Chapter  , Part  , Utah Adoption Act.                                     This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint                             legal custody, joint physical custody or sole custody, but allows the court and the family the                          widest discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.

In determining whether the best interest of a child will not be served by ordering                            joint legal  or  and physical custody, the court shall consider the following factors                                  a   whether the physical, psychological, and emotional needs and development of the                            child will benefit more from a custody arrangement other than joint legal  or  and physical                            custody                                  b   the ability of the parents to give first priority to the welfare of the child and reach                            shared decisions in the child s best interest                                  c   whether each parent is capable of encouraging and accepting a positive relationship                            between the child and the other parent, including the sharing of love, affection, and contact                            between the child and the other parent                                  d   whether both parents participated in raising the child before the divorce                                  e   the geographical proximity of the homes of the parents                                  f   the preference of the child if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to reason so                            as to form an intelligent preference as to joint legal or physical custody                                  g   the maturity of the parents and their willingness and ability to protect the child from                            conflict that may arise between the parents                                  h   the past and present ability of the parents to cooperate with each other and make                            decisions jointly                                  i   any history of, or potential for, child abuse, spouse abuse, or kidnaping  and                                 j   any other factors the court finds relevant.

In evaluating and determining the overnight parent time to be awarded to each                           parent, the court s order shall require the parents to                                  a   have significant, well defined periods of responsibility for the child                                  b   be allowed and expected to have responsibility for the child s financial, physical,                           emotional and developmental needs during that parent s periods of responsibility  and                                 c   consult with each other on major decisions involving the child before implementing                           those decisions and that neither parent may make a decision or take an action which results in a                           major change in the child s life until the matter has been discussed and agreed upon.

An order of joint legal  or  custody, joint physical custody, or both shall provide                            terms the court determines appropriate, which may include specifying                                  a   either the county of residence of the child, until altered by further order of the court,                            or the custodian who has the sole legal right to determine the residence of the child                                  b   that the parents shall exchange information concerning the health, education, and                            welfare of the child, and where possible, confer before making decisions concerning any of                            these areas                                  c   the rights and duties of each parent regarding the child s present and future physical                            care, support, and education                                  d   provisions to minimize disruption of the child s daily routine, attendance at school                            and other activities,  his daily routine,  and  his  association with friends  and                                 e   as necessary, the remaining parental rights, privileges, duties, and powers to be                            exercised by the parents solely, concurrently, or jointly.                                     The court shall, where possible, include in the order the terms of the parenting plan                            provided in accordance with Section            .     .                                     Any parental rights not specifically addressed by the court order may be exercised                               by the parent having physical custody of the child at the  majority of the  time the issue arises                           unless the decision will result in a major change in the child s life.  If the decision will result in                           a major change in the child s life the other parent shall be consulted and a decision made                           jointly.                                     The appointment of joint legal custodians does not impair or limit the authority of                            the court to order support of the child, including payments by one custodian to the other.                                     An order of joint legal custody, in itself, is not grounds for modifying a support                            order.                                     An order of joint legal or physical custody shall require a parenting plan                            incorporating a dispute resolution procedure the parties agree to use before seeking                            enforcement or modification of the terms and conditions of the order of joint legal or physical                            custody through litigation, except in emergency situations requiring ex parte orders to protect                            the child.                                Section  .    Section           .      is amended to read                                         . .  Modification or termination of order.                                     On the petition of one or both of the parents, or the joint legal or physical                            custodians if they are not the parents, the court may, after a hearing, modify or terminate an                            order that established joint legal or physical custody if                                  a   the verified petition or accompanying affidavit initially alleges that admissible                            evidence will show that the circumstances of the child or one or both parents or joint legal or                            physical custodians have materially and substantially changed since the entry of the order to be                            modified                                  b   a modification of the terms and conditions of the order would be an improvement                            for and in the best interest of the child  and                                 c   i   both parents have complied in good faith with the dispute resolution procedure                            in accordance with Subsection            .          or                                 ii   if no dispute resolution procedure is contained in the order that established joint                            legal or physical custody, the court orders the parents to participate in a dispute resolution                            procedure in accordance with Subsection            .         unless the parents certify that, in good                            faith, they have utilized a dispute resolution procedure to resolve their dispute.                                     a   In determining whether the best interest of a child will be served by either                               modifying or terminating the joint legal or physical custody order, the court shall, in addition to                            other factors the court considers relevant, consider the factors outlined in Section                 and                            Subsection            .        .                                 b   The court shall make specific written findings on each of the factors relied upon                            stating                                  i   a material and substantial change of circumstance has occurred  and                                 ii   a modification of the terms and conditions of the order would be an improvement                            for and in the best interest of the child.                                 c   The court shall give substantial weight to the existing joint legal or physical custody                            order when the child is thriving, happy, and well adjusted.                                     The court shall, in every case regarding a petition for termination of a joint legal or                            physical custody order, consider reasonable alternatives to preserve the existing order in                            accordance with Subsection                    b .  The court may modify the terms and conditions of                            the existing order  in accordance with Subsection                     and may order the parents to file                            a parenting plan in accordance with this chapter.                                     A parent requesting a modification from sole custody to joint legal custody or joint                            physical custody or both, or any other type of shared parenting arrangement, shall file and serve                            a proposed parenting plan with the petition to modify in accordance with Section            .     .                                     If the court finds that an action under this section is filed or answered frivolously                            and in a manner designed to harass the other party, the court shall assess attorney fees as costs                            against the offending party.                                Section  .    Section           .      is amended to read                                         . .  Parenting plan    Filing    Modifications.                                     In any proceeding under this chapter, including actions for paternity,  any  a party                             requesting joint custody, joint legal or physical custody, or any other type of shared parenting                           arrangement,  shall file and serve a proposed parenting plan at the time of the filing of their                            original petition or at the time of filing their answer or counterclaim.                                     If a party in any action under this chapter, including actions for paternity, requests                           custody of a minor child that is not joint physical custody, joint legal custody, or both, the party                           shall articulate within the parenting plan                                  a   substantial justification for the deviation from joint custody                                     b   a proposed parent time schedule that provides both parents with meaningful                           opportunities to share in the parenting of the child  and                                 c   any other information necessary to enable the court to make a determination in the                           child s best interest and the parental relationship.                                           In proceedings for a modification of custody provisions or modification of a                            parenting plan, a proposed parenting plan shall be filed and served with the petition to modify,                            or the answer or counterclaim to the petition to modify.                                           A party who files a proposed parenting plan in compliance with this section                            may move the court for an order of default to adopt the plan if the other party fails to file a                            proposed parenting plan as required by this section.  However, a parenting plan entered by                           default may not provide a parent with less than joint physical and joint legal custody without a                           hearing to determine whether less parent time is in the best interest of the child.                                           Either party may file and serve an amended proposed parenting plan according                            to the rules for amending pleadings.                                           The parent submitting a proposed parenting plan shall attach a verified                            statement that the plan is proposed by that parent in good faith.                                           Both parents may submit a parenting plan which has been agreed upon.  A                            verified statement, signed by both parents, shall be attached.                                           If the parents file inconsistent parenting plans, the court may appoint a                            guardian ad litem to represent the best interests of the child, who may, if necessary, file a                            separate parenting plan reflecting the best interests of the child.                                Section  .    Section                is amended to read                                         .
