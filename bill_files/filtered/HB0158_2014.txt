The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection     that                                  a   agricultural timber, logging, and forest product industries on the lands comprising                           these timber zones have provided a significant contribution to the history, customs, culture,                           economy, welfare, and other values of each area for many decades                                  b   abundant natural and vegetative resources exist within these zones to support and                           expand continued, responsible timber, logging, and other forest product activities                                  c   agricultural timber, logging, and forest product activities in these zones, and the                           associated historic resources, human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural                           resources, landmarks, structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of                           recognition, preservation and protection                                  d   i   the highest management priorities for lands within these zones are responsible                           preservation and enhancement, and restoration and development of historic, existing, and                           future timber, logging, and forest product resources in order to provide protection for the                           resources, objects, customs, culture, and values identified above  and                                 ii   notwithstanding Subsection     d  i , if part or all of any zone lies within a sage                           grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with                           the management priorities set forth in Subsection     d  i  to the maximum extent consistent                              with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area                                  e   subject to Subsection     d  ii , responsible development of any deposits of energy                           and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold,                           uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in                           these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these                           zones  and                                 f   subject to Subsection     d  ii , responsible development of any recreation                           resources, including wildlife, roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use,                           sightseeing, canyoneering, hunting, fishing, and hiking resources that may exist in these timber                           zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection     d  i  in these timber                           zones.                                      The state finds that the historic levels of timber, logging, and forest products                            activities in the zones described in Subsection     have greatly diminished, or are under serious                            threat, due to                                   a   unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies,                            including                                   i   de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas                                   ii   ignoring the multiple use sustained yield mission of the forest service                                   iii   ignoring the fact that the forest service s parent agency is the United States                            Department of Agriculture whose mission includes providing timber as an important                            agriculture resource  and                                  iv   the arbitrary administrative reductions in timber, logging, and forest products                            activities                                   b   improper management of forest vegetation resulting in the overcrowding of old                            growth alpine species and the crowding out of aspen diversity, all of which results in                                   i   devastation of entire mountainsides due to insect infestation and disease                                   ii   reduced water yield                                   iii   increased catastrophic wildfire                                   iv   increased soil erosion                                   v   degradation of wildlife habitat  and                                  vi   suppression and threatened extinction of important rural economic activities  and                                     c   other practices that degrade overall forest health.                                      To protect and preserve the threats described in Subsection    , the state supports                            the following with respect to the zones described in Subsection                                       a   efficient and responsible full development, within each timber zone, of                                   i   robust timber thinning and harvesting programs and activities  and                                  ii   other uses compatible with increased timber, logging, and forest product activities                            including a return to historic levels of timber, logging, and forest product activity in each of                            these zones                                   b   a cooperative management approach by federal agencies, the state, and local                            governments to achieve broadly supported management plans for the full development, within                            each timber zone, of                                   i   all forest product resources  and                                  ii   other uses compatible with timber activities  and                                  c   effective and responsible management of wildlife.
