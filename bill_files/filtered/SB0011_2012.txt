Subsection     b  with technical or factual information if the moving party proves                           that                                  A   good cause exists for supplementing the record                                  B   supplementing the record is in the interest of justice  and                                    C   supplementing the record is necessary for resolution of the issues.                                 iv   The administrative law judge may supplement the record with technical or factual                           information on the administrative law judge s own motion if the administrative law judge                           determines that adequate grounds exist to supplement the record under Subsections                               c  iii  A  through  C .

                   action in accordance with Subsections       G              d  and  e , following the relevant                           procedures for formal adjudicative proceedings.                                 b   The administrative law judge shall require the parties to file responsive pleadings in                           accordance with Section       G          .                                 c   If an administrative law judge enters an order of default against a party, the                           administrative law judge shall enter the order of default in accordance with Section       G          ,                           following the relevant procedures for formal adjudicative proceedings.                                 d   The administrative law judge, in conducting a permit review adjudicative                           proceeding                                  i   may not participate in an ex parte communication with a party to the permit review

          a   A person who files a request for agency action has the burden of demonstrating                           that an issue or argument raised in the request for agency action has been preserved in                           accordance with Subsection    .                                 b   The administrative law judge shall dismiss, with prejudice, any issue or argument

In response to a dispositive motion, the administrative law judge may submit a                           proposed dispositive action to the board recommending full or partial resolution of the permit                           review adjudicative proceeding, that includes                                  a   written findings of fact                                  b   written conclusions of law  and                                 c   a recommended order.                                      For each issue or argument that is not dismissed or otherwise resolved under                           Subsection      b  or     , the administrative law judge shall                                  a

When the administrative law judge submits a proposed dispositive action to                           the board, the board may                                  i   adopt, adopt with modifications, or reject the proposed dispositive action  or                                 ii   return the proposed dispositive action to the administrative law judge for further                              action as directed.                                 b   On review of a proposed dispositive action, the board shall uphold all factual,                           technical, and scientific agency

unless notice and an opportunity to be heard are afforded to all parties.                                 ii   Upon receiving an ex parte communication, the board shall place the                           communication in the public record of the proceeding and afford all parties an opportunity to                           comment on the information.                                 d   In reviewing a proposed dispositive action during a permit review adjudicative                           proceeding, the board may take judicial notice of matters not in the record, in accordance with                           Utah Rules of Evidence, Rule    .                                 e   The board may use its technical expertise in making a determination.                                      a   A party may seek judicial review in the Utah Court of Appeals of a dispositive                           action in a permit review adjudicative proceeding, in accordance with Sections       G          ,

       adjudicative proceeding to                                  i   the record described in Subsections     b ,     c ,     e , and      d   and                                 ii   the record made by the administrative law judge and the board during the permit                           review adjudicative proceeding.                                 c   During judicial review of a dispositive action, the appellate court shall                                  i   review all agency determinations in accordance with Subsection       G             ,                           recognizing that the agency has been granted substantial discretion to interpret its governing                           statutes and rules  and                                 ii   uphold all factual, technical, and

of a request for agency action does not stay a permit or delay the                           effective date of a permit.                                 b   A permit may not be stayed or delayed unless a stay is granted under this                           Subsection     .                                 c   The administrative law judge shall                                  i   consider a party s motion to stay a permit during a permit review adjudicative                           proceeding  and                                 ii   submit a proposed determination on the stay to the board.                                 d   The administrative law judge may not recommend to the board a stay of a permit,                           or a portion of a permit, unless                                  i   all parties agree to the stay  or                                 ii   the party seeking the stay demonstrates that                                  A   the party seeking the stay will suffer irreparable harm unless the stay is issued                                  B   the threatened injury to the party seeking the stay outweighs whatever damage the                           proposed stay is likely to cause the party restrained or enjoined                                  C   the stay, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest  and                                 D   there is a substantial likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the                           merits of the underlying claim, or the case presents serious issues on the merits, which should                           be the subject of further adjudication.                                 e   A party may appeal a board s decision regarding a stay of a permit to the
