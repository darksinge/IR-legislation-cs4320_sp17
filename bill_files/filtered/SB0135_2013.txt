Proceedings for involuntary commitment of an individual who is    years of age or                           older may be commenced by filing a written application with the district court of the county in                           which the proposed patient resides or is found, by a responsible person who has reason to know                           of the condition or circumstances of the proposed patient which lead to the belief that the                           individual has a mental illness and should be involuntarily committed.  That application shall                           be accompanied by                                 a   a certificate of a licensed physician or a designated examiner stating that within a                           seven day period immediately preceding the certification the physician or designated examiner                           has examined the individual, and that the physician or designated examiner is of the opinion                           that the individual is mentally ill and should be involuntarily committed  or                                b   a written statement by the applicant that                                 i   the individual has been requested to, but has refused to, submit to an examination of                           mental condition by a licensed physician or designated examiner                                 ii   is sworn to under oath  and                                iii   states the facts upon which the application is based.                                     Before   a   Subject to Subsection     b , before issuing a judicial order, the court                           may require the applicant to consult with the appropriate local mental health authority,  or  and                           may direct a mental health professional from that local mental health authority to interview the                           applicant and the proposed patient to determine the existing facts and report them to the court.                                b   The consultation described in Subsection     a                                  i   may take place at or before the hearing  and                                ii   is required if the local mental health authority appears at the hearing.                                    If the court finds from the application, from any other statements under oath, or                           from any reports from a mental health professional that there is a reasonable basis to believe                           that the proposed patient has a mental illness  which  that poses a substantial danger, as                           defined in Section       A           , to self or others requiring involuntary commitment pending                           examination and hearing  or, if the proposed patient has refused to submit to an interview with                              a mental health professional as directed by the court or to go to a treatment facility voluntarily,                           the court may issue an order, directed to a mental health officer or peace officer, to                           immediately place the proposed patient in the custody of a local mental health authority or in a                           temporary emergency facility as provided in Section       A            to be detained for the purpose                           of examination.  Within    hours of the issuance of the order for examination, a local mental                           health authority or its designee shall report to the court, orally or in writing, whether the patient                           is, in the opinion of the examiners, mentally ill, whether the patient has agreed to become a                           voluntary patient under Section       A           , and whether treatment programs are available and                           acceptable without court proceedings.  Based on that information, the court may, without                           taking any further action, terminate the proceedings and dismiss the application.  In any event,                           if the examiner reports orally, the examiner shall immediately send the report in writing to the                           clerk of the court.                                    Notice of commencement of proceedings for involuntary commitment, setting forth                           the allegations of the application and any reported facts, together with a copy of any official                           order of detention, shall be provided by the court to a proposed patient before, or upon,                           placement in the custody of a local mental health authority or, with respect to any individual                           presently in the custody of a local mental health authority whose status is being changed from                           voluntary to involuntary, upon the filing of an application for that purpose with the court.  A                           copy of that order of detention shall be maintained at the place of detention.                                    Notice of commencement of those proceedings shall be provided by the court as                           soon as practicable to the applicant, any legal guardian, any immediate adult family members,                           legal counsel for the parties involved, the local mental health authority or its designee, and any                           other persons whom the proposed patient or the court shall designate.  That notice shall advise                           those persons that a hearing may be held within the time provided by law.  If the patient has                           refused to permit release of information necessary for provisions of notice under this                           subsection, the extent of notice shall be determined by the court.                                    Proceedings for commitment of an individual under the age of    years to the                           division may be commenced by filing a written application with the juvenile court in                              accordance with the provisions of Part  , Commitment of Persons Under Age    to Division of                           Substance Abuse and Mental Health.                                    The district court may, in its discretion, transfer the case to any other district court                           within this state, provided that the transfer will not be adverse to the interest of the proposed                           patient.                                    a   Within    hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, of the                           issuance of a judicial order, or after commitment  of a proposed patient to a local mental health                           authority under court order for detention or examination, the court shall appoint two designated                           examiners to examine the proposed patient.  If requested by the proposed patient s counsel, the                           court shall appoint, as one of the examiners, a reasonably available qualified person designated                           by counsel.  The examinations, to be conducted separately, shall be held at the home of the                           proposed patient, a hospital or other medical facility, or at any other suitable place that is not                           likely to have a harmful effect on the patient s health.                                b   The examiner shall inform the patient if not represented by an attorney that, if                            desired, the patient does not have to say anything, the nature and reasons for the examination,                            that it was ordered by the court, that any information volunteered could form part of the basis                            for  his or her  the patient s involuntary commitment, and that findings resulting from the                            examination will be made available to the court.                                 c   A time shall be set for a hearing to be held within    calendar days of the                            appointment of the designated examiners, unless those examiners or a local mental health                            authority or its designee informs the court prior to that hearing date that the patient is not                            mentally ill, that the patient has agreed to become a voluntary patient under Section                               A           , or that treatment programs are available and acceptable without court                            proceedings, in which event the court may, without taking any further action, terminate the                            proceedings and dismiss the application.                                     a   Before the hearing, an opportunity to be represented by counsel shall be                            afforded to every proposed patient, and if neither the patient nor others provide counsel, the                            court shall appoint counsel and allow counsel sufficient time to consult with the patient before                               the hearing.  In the case of an indigent patient, the payment of reasonable attorney fees for                            counsel, as determined by the court, shall be made by the county in which the patient resides or                            was found.                                 b   The proposed patient, the applicant, and all other persons to whom notice is                            required to be given shall be afforded an opportunity to appear at the hearing, to testify, and to                            present and cross examine witnesses.  The court may, in its discretion, receive the testimony of                            any other person.  The court may allow a waiver of the patient s right to appear only for good                            cause shown, and that cause shall be made a matter of court record.                                 c   The court is authorized to exclude all persons not necessary for the conduct of the                            proceedings and may, upon motion of counsel, require the testimony of each examiner to be                            given out of the presence of any other examiners.                                 d   The hearing shall be conducted in as informal a manner as may be consistent with                            orderly procedure, and in a physical setting that is not likely to have a harmful effect on the                            mental health of the proposed patient.                                 e   The court shall consider all relevant historical and material information  which  that                            is offered, subject to the rules of evidence, including reliable hearsay under Rule     , Utah                            Rules of Evidence.                                 f   i   A local mental health authority or its designee, or the physician in charge of the                            patient s care shall, at the time of the hearing, provide the court with the following information                                  A   the detention order                                  B   admission notes                                  C   the diagnosis                                  D   any doctors  orders                                  E   progress notes                                  F   nursing notes  and                                 G   medication records pertaining to the current commitment.                                 ii   That information shall also be supplied to the patient s counsel at the time of the                            hearing, and at any time prior to the hearing upon request.                                         The court shall order commitment of an individual who is    years of age or older                            to a local mental health authority if, upon completion of the hearing and consideration of the                            information presented in accordance with Subsection     e , the court finds by clear and                            convincing evidence that                                  a   the proposed patient has a mental illness                                  b   because of the proposed patient s mental illness the proposed patient poses a                            substantial danger, as defined in Section       A           , to self or others, which may include the                            inability to provide the basic necessities of life such as food, clothing, and shelter, if allowed to                            remain at liberty                                  c   the patient lacks the ability to engage in a rational decision making process                            regarding the acceptance of mental treatment as demonstrated by evidence of inability to weigh                            the possible risks of accepting or rejecting treatment                                  d   there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative to a court order of commitment                             and                                 e   the local mental health authority can provide the individual with treatment that is                            adequate and appropriate to the individual s conditions and needs.  In the absence of the                            required findings of the court after the hearing, the court shall forthwith dismiss the                            proceedings.                                      a   The order of commitment shall designate the period for which the individual                            shall be treated.  When the individual is not under an order of commitment at the time of the                            hearing, that period may not exceed six months without benefit of a review hearing.  Upon                            such a review hearing, to be commenced prior to the expiration of the previous order, an order                            for commitment may be for an indeterminate period, if the court finds by clear and convincing                            evidence that the required conditions in Subsection      will last for an indeterminate period.                                 b   The court shall maintain a current list of all patients under its order of commitment.                             That list shall be reviewed to determine those patients who have been under an order of                            commitment for the designated period.  At least two weeks prior to the expiration of the                            designated period of any order of commitment still in effect, the court that entered the original                               order shall inform the appropriate local mental health authority or its designee.
