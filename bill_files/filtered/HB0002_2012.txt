The Legislature also intends that local authorities be                            encouraged to participate in the construction of pedestrian                            safety devices.  The appropriated funds are to be used                            according to the criteria set forth in Section         , Utah                            code Annotated,     .  The funds appropriated for sidewalk                            construction shall not lapse.  If local governments cannot use                            their allocation of Sidewalk Safety Funds in two years, these                            funds will be available for other governmental entities which                            are prepared to use the resources.  It is the intent of the                            Legislature that local participation in the Sidewalk                            Construction Program is on a     state and     local match                            basis.
