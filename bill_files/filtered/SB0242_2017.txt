The following circumstances constitute  extraordinary circumstances  that allow a        governmental entity to delay approval or denial by an additional period of time as specified in        Subsection     if the governmental entity determines that due to the extraordinary        circumstances it cannot respond within the time limits provided in Subsection                   a   another governmental entity is using the record, in which case the originating        governmental entity shall promptly request that the governmental entity currently in possession        return the record               b   another governmental entity is using the record as part of an audit, and returning the        record before the completion of the audit would impair the conduct of the audit               c   i   the request is for a voluminous quantity of records or a record series containing a        substantial number of records  or              ii   the requester seeks a substantial number of records or records series in requests        filed within five working days of each other               d   the governmental entity is currently processing a large number of records requests               e   the request requires the governmental entity to review a large number of records to        locate the records requested               f   the decision to release a record involves legal issues that require the governmental        entity to seek legal counsel for the analysis of statutes, rules, ordinances, regulations, or case        law               g   segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from information        that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires extensive editing  or              h   segregating information that the requester is entitled to inspect from information        that the requester is not entitled to inspect requires computer programming.

If the governmental entity fails to provide the requested records or issue a denial        within the specified time period, that failure is considered the equivalent of a determination        denying access to the record.
