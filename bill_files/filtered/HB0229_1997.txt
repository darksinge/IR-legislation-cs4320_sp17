The court may decree a dissolution of the marriage contract between the  plaintiff           petitioner and  defendant  respondent on the grounds specified in Subsection     in all cases where          the  plaintiff  petitioner or  defendant  respondent has been an actual and bona fide resident of this          state and of the county where the action is brought, or if members of the armed forces of the          United States who are not legal residents of this state, where the  plaintiff  petitioner has been          stationed in this state under military orders, for three months next prior to the commencement of          the action.

For this purpose either party may         have leave from the court to enter any asylum or institution where the  defendant  respondent may         be confined.  The costs of court in this action shall be apportioned by the court.               Section  .  Section         is amended to read                      .

The court may waive this requirement, on its own          motion or on the motion of one of the parties, if it determines course attendance and completion          are not necessary, appropriate, feasible, or in the best interest of the parties.               d   All hearings and trials for divorce shall be held before the court or the court          commissioner as provided by Section         and rules of the Judicial Council.
