The charge for these services is determined  according to the type of services and the test volume, and is based on the cost  to the Laboratory and therefore may be lower than the fee schedule.  Because    of changing needs, the Laboratory receives requests for new tests or services  that are impossible to anticipate and list fully in a standard fee schedule.   Charges for these services are authorized and are to be based on costs.

Children with Special Health Care Needs Note       The schedule of charges for Children with Special Health Care Needs  services provided by the Division of Community and Family Health Services  represents commonly performed procedures by CPT code and is consistent  with charges by the private sector.  The list is not intended to be  comprehensive as the Division is mandated to assign a charge for all services  performed and there is potentially an unlimited number of procedures that  could be provided.  If unlisted services are performed, charges consistent with  the private sector will be assigned.  Office Visit, New Patient        Problem focused, straightforward       .

The Division assigns a charge to all services performed regardless of the  client s or third party insurer s financial responsibility or the likelihood of  receiving payment for the services.  Projected numbers of units of services are  based on past experiences but are subject to significant variation determined  by the actual needs of patients and changes in medical practices.  Hence, it is  not possible to calculate the change in revenue resulting from a change in the  charge for a given service.
