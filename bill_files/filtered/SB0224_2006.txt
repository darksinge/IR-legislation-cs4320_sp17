    A       . .     As used in this section  a    Covered person  has the same meaning as defined in Section       A           . b   i    Underinsured motor vehicle  includes a motor vehicle, the operation,maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time of an injury causingoccurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the injured partyfor all special and general damages. ii   The term  underinsured motor vehicle  does not include  A   a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same policy thatalso contains the underinsured motorist coverage  B   an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection       A                or C   a motor vehicle owned or leased by  I   the named insured  II   the named insured s spouse  or III   any dependent of the named insured.     a   i   Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection       A               c provides coverage for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover damages fromowners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, disease,or death. ii   A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or furnishedto the covered person, the covered person s spouse, or covered person s resident relative mayrecover underinsured benefits only if the motor vehicle is  A   described in the policy under

reasonably explains the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and iii   discloses the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motoristcoverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the insured s motor vehicle liabilitycoverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer underthe insured s motor vehicle policy. c   A self insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide underinsuredmotorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self insured retention underSubsections     b  and     g  by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement fromthe chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the  i   self insured entity s coverage level  and ii   process for filing an underinsured motorist claim. d   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than  i      ,    for one person in any one accident  and ii   at least    ,    for two or more persons in any one accident. e   The acknowledgment under Subsection     b  continues for that issuer of theunderinsured motorist coverage until the insured, in writing, requests different underinsuredmotorist coverage from the insurer. f   i   The named insured s underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection    a , is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motorvehicle, as described in Subsection    . ii   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage ofthe owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with,or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motorvehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person. g   i   A named insured may reject underinsured motorist coverage by an expresswriting to the insurer that provides liability coverage under Subsection       A               a . ii   This written rejection shall be on a form provided by the insurer that includes areasonable explanation of the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage and when it would beapplicable.

purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and B   the costs associated with increasing the coverage in amounts up to and includingthe maximum amount available by the insurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy. ii   The disclosure required by this Subsection     h  shall be sent to all insureds thatcarry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the insured s motor vehicleliability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by theinsurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy.     a   i   Except as provided in this Subsection    , a covered person injured in amotor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not electto collect underinsured motorist coverage benefits from any other motor vehicle insurancepolicy. ii   The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motorvehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurancecoverage available to an injured person for any one accident. iii   Subsection     a  ii  applies to all persons except a covered person describedunder Subsections     b  i  and  ii . b   i   Except as provided in Subsection     b  ii , a covered person injured whileoccupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to thecovered person, the covered

households  and II   injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, orfurnished to the covered person, the covered person s resident parent, or the covered person sresident sibling. B   Each parent s policy under this Subsection     b  ii  is liable only for thepercentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent s policy of underinsuredmotorist coverage bears to the total of both parents  underinsured coverage applicable to theaccident. iii   A covered person s recovery under any available policies may not exceed the fullamount of damages. iv   Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident shallbe primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections     A               a  and  b  shall be secondary coverage. v   The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other. vi   A covered person as described under Subsection     b  i  is entitled to the highestlimits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per householdapplicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative. vii   A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections ifrecovery is unavailable under previous elections. viii   A   As used in this section,  interpolicy stacking  means recovering benefits for asingle incident of loss under more than one insurance policy. B   Except to the extent permitted by this Subsection    , interpolicy stacking isprohibited for underinsured motorist coverage. c   Underinsured motorist coverage  i   is secondary to the benefits provided by Title   A, Chapter  , Workers Compensation Act  ii   may not be subrogated by the workers  compensation insurance carrier  iii   may not be reduced by any benefits provided by workers  compensation insurance  iv   may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person hasbeen made whole  v   may not be collected for bodily injury or death sustained by a person  A   while committing a violation of Section         a           B   who, as a passenger in a vehicle, has knowledge that the vehicle is being operatedin violation of Section         a           or C   while committing a felony  and vi   notwithstanding Subsection     c  v , may be recovered  A   for a person under    years of age who is injured within the scope of Subsection    c  v  but limited to medical and funeral expenses  or B   by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section                  , who is injuredwithin the course and scope of the law enforcement officer s duties.     The inception of the loss under Subsection       A               for underinsuredmotorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.     a   Within five business days after notification in a manner specified by thedepartment that all liability insurers have tendered their liability policy limits, the underinsuredcarrier shall either  i   waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the personliable for the injuries caused in the accident  or ii   pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability carrier. b   If neither option is exercised under Subsection     a , the subrogation claim isconsidered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.     Except as otherwise provided in this section, a covered person may seek, subject tothe terms and conditions of the policy, additional coverage under any policy  a   that provides coverage for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents  and b   that is not required to conform to Section       A           .     a   When a claim is brought by a named insured or a person described inSubsection       A               and is asserted against the covered person s underinsured motoristcarrier, the claimant may elect to resolve the claim  i   by submitting the claim to binding arbitration  or ii

                         the operation, maintenance, or use of which is covered under a liability policy at the time of an                           injury causing occurrence, but which has insufficient liability coverage to compensate fully the                           injured party for all special and general damages.                                   b   The term  underinsured motor vehicle  does not include                                    i   a motor vehicle that is covered under the liability coverage of the same policy that                           also contains the underinsured motorist coverage                                    ii   an uninsured motor vehicle as defined in Subsection      or                                   iii   a motor vehicle owned or leased by                                    A   the named insured                                    B   the named insured s spouse  or                                   C   any dependent of the named insured.                                       a   i   Underinsured motorist coverage under Subsection       A               c                            provides coverage for covered persons who are legally entitled to recover damages from                           owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, disease,                           or death.                                   ii   A covered person occupying or using a motor vehicle owned, leased, or furnished                           to the covered person, the covered person s spouse, or covered person s resident relative may                           recover underinsured benefits only if the motor vehicle is                                    A   described in the policy under which a claim is made  or                                   B   a newly acquired or replacement motor vehicle covered under the terms of the                           policy.                                   b   For new policies written on or after January  ,     , the limits of underinsured                           motorist coverage shall be equal to the lesser of the limits of the insured s motor vehicle                           liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                           insurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy, unless the insured purchases coverage in a                           lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form provided by the insurer that                                       i   waives the higher coverage                                    ii   reasonably explains the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and                                   iii   discloses the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist                           coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the insured s motor vehicle liability                           coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer under                           the insured s motor vehicle policy.                                   c  A self insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide underinsured                           motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self insured retention under                           Subsections     b  and     g  by issuing a declaratory memorandum or policy statement from                           the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the                                    i   self insured entity s coverage level  and                                   ii   process for filing an underinsured motorist claim.                                   d   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than                                    i      ,    for one person in any one accident  and

                         underinsured motorist coverage until the insured, in writing, requests different underinsured                           motorist coverage from the insurer.                                   f   i   The named insured s underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection                               a , is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motor                           vehicle, as described in Subsection    .                                   ii   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage of                           the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with,                           or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motor                           vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.                                   g   i   A named insured may reject underinsured motorist coverage by an express                           writing to the insurer that provides liability coverage under Subsection       A               a .                                   ii   This written rejection shall be on a form provided by the insurer that includes a                              reasonable explanation of the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage and when it would be                           applicable.                                   iii   This rejection continues for that issuer of the liability coverage until the insured in                           writing requests underinsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.                                   h   i   In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January  ,     , for                           policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium                           renewal notice, an explanation of                                    A   the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and                                   B   the costs associated with increasing the coverage in amounts up to and including                           the maximum amount available by the insurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy.                                   ii   The disclosure required by this Subsection     h  shall be sent to all insureds that                           carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the insured s motor vehicle                           liability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                           insurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy.                                        a   i   Except as provided in this Subsection     , a covered person injured in a                           motor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not elect                           to collect underinsured motorist coverage benefits from any other motor vehicle insurance                           policy.                                   ii   The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motor                           vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance                           coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.                                   iii   Subsection      a  ii  applies to all persons except a covered person described                           under Subsections      b  i  and  ii .                                   b   i   Except as provided in Subsection      b  ii , a covered person injured while                           occupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to the                           covered person, the covered person s spouse, or the covered person s resident parent or resident                           sibling, may also recover benefits under any one other policy under which they are a covered                           person.                                      ii   A   A covered person may recover benefits from no more than two additional                           policies, one additional policy from each parent s household if the covered person is                                    I   a dependent minor of parents who reside in separate households  and                                   II   injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or                           furnished to the covered person, the covered person s resident parent, or the covered person s                           resident sibling.                                   B   Each parent s policy under this Subsection      b  ii  is liable only for the                           percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent s policy of underinsured                           motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents  underinsured coverage applicable to the                           accident.                                   iii   A covered person s recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full                           amount of damages.                                   iv   Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident                           shall be primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections                               a  and  b  shall be secondary coverage.                                   v   The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other.                                   vi   A covered person as described under Subsection      b  i  is entitled to the                           highest limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per                           household applicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative.                                   vii   A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections if                           recovery is unavailable under previous elections.                                   viii   A   As used in this section,  interpolicy stacking  means recovering benefits for                           a single incident of loss under more than one insurance policy.                                   B   Except to the extent permitted by this Subsection     , interpolicy stacking is                           prohibited for underinsured motorist coverage.                                   c   Underinsured motorist coverage                                    i   is secondary to the benefits provided by Title   A, Chapter  , Workers                            Compensation Act                                       ii   may not be subrogated by the workers  compensation insurance carrier                                    iii   may not be reduced by any benefits provided by workers  compensation                           insurance                                    iv   may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person has                           been made whole                                    v   may not be collected for bodily injury or death sustained by a person                                    A   while committing a violation of Section         a                                             B   who, as a passenger in a vehicle, has knowledge that the vehicle is being operated                           in violation of Section         a           or                                   C   while committing a felony  and                                   vi   notwithstanding Subsection      c  v , may be recovered                                    A   for a person under    years of age who is injured within the scope of Subsection                                c  v  but limited to medical and funeral expenses  or                                   B   by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section                  , who is injured                           within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer s duties.                                        The inception of the loss under Subsection       A               for underinsured                           motorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.                                        a   Within five business days after notification in a manner specified by the                           department that all liability insurers have tendered their liability policy limits, the underinsured                           carrier shall either                                    i   waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the person                           liable for the injuries caused in the accident  or                                   ii   pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability                           carrier.                                   b   If neither option is exercised under Subsection      a , the subrogation claim is                           considered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.                                        Except as otherwise provided in this section, a covered person may seek, subject                           to the terms and conditions of the policy, additional coverage under any policy

or other relief                           granted on a claim for damages if the claim for damages                                  i   was not fully disclosed in writing prior to the arbitration

the insured s motor vehicle                           liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                           insurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy, unless the insured purchases coverage in a                           lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form provided by the insurer that

   f   i   The named insured s underinsured motorist coverage, as described in Subsection                               a , is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an underinsured motor                           vehicle, as described in Subsection    .                                 ii   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage of                           the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with,                           or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motor                           vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.                                 g   i   A named insured may reject underinsured motorist coverage by an express                           writing to the insurer that provides liability coverage under Subsection       A               a .

coverage and when it would be                           applicable.                                 iii   This rejection continues for that issuer of the liability coverage until the insured in                           writing requests underinsured motorist coverage from that liability insurer.                                 h   i   In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January  ,     , for                           policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium                           renewal notice, an explanation of                                  A   the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and                                 B   the costs associated with increasing the coverage in amounts up to and

Subsection     h  shall be sent to all insureds that                           carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the insured s motor vehicle                           liability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                           insurer under the insured s motor vehicle policy.

                     B   Each parent s policy under this Subsection     b  ii  is liable only for the                           percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent s policy of underinsured                           motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents  underinsured coverage applicable to the                           accident.                                 iii   A covered person s recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full                           amount of damages.                                 iv   Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident shall                           be primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections                                A               a  and  b  shall be secondary coverage.                                 v   The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other.                                 vi   A covered person as described under Subsection     b  i  is entitled to the highest                           limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per household                              applicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative.                                 vii   A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections if                           recovery is unavailable under previous elections.                                 viii   A   As used in this section,  interpolicy stacking  means recovering benefits for a                           single incident of loss under more than one insurance policy.                                 B   Except to the extent permitted by this Subsection    , interpolicy stacking is                           prohibited for underinsured motorist coverage.                                 c   Underinsured motorist coverage                                  i   is secondary to the benefits provided by Title   A, Chapter  , Workers                            Compensation Act                                  ii   may not be subrogated by the workers  compensation insurance carrier                                  iii   may not be reduced by any benefits provided by workers  compensation insurance                                  iv   may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person has                           been made whole                                  v   may not be collected for bodily injury or death sustained by a person                                  A   while committing a violation of Section         a                                           B   who, as a passenger in a vehicle, has knowledge that the vehicle is being operated                           in violation of Section         a           or                                 C   while committing a felony  and                                 vi   notwithstanding Subsection     c  v , may be recovered                                  A   for a person under    years of age who is injured within the scope of Subsection                               c  v  but limited to medical and funeral expenses  or                                 B   by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section                  , who is injured                           within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer s duties.                                     The inception of the loss under Subsection       A               for underinsured                           motorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.                                     a   Within five business days after notification in a manner specified by the                           department that all liability insurers have tendered their liability policy limits, the underinsured                              carrier shall either                                  i   waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the person                           liable for the injuries caused in the accident  or                                 ii   pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability carrier.                                 b   If neither option is exercised under Subsection     a , the subrogation claim is                           considered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.                                     Except as otherwise provided in this section, a covered person may seek, subject to                           the terms and conditions of the policy, additional coverage under any policy                                  a   that provides coverage for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents  and                                 b   that is not required to conform to Section       A           .                                     a   When a claim is brought by a named insured or a person described in                           Subsection       A               and is asserted against the covered person s underinsured motorist                           carrier, the claimant may elect to resolve the claim                                  i   by submitting the claim to binding arbitration  or                                 ii   through litigation.                                 b   Unless otherwise provided in the policy under which underinsured benefits are                           claimed, the election provided in Subsection     a  is available to the claimant only.                                 c   Once the claimant has elected to commence litigation under Subsection     a  ii ,                           the claimant may not elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration under this section                           without the written consent of the underinsured motorist coverage carrier.                                 d   i   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, a claim that is submitted to                           binding arbitration under Subsection     a  i  shall be resolved by a single arbitrator.                                 ii   All parties shall agree on the single arbitrator selected under Subsection     d  i .                                 iii   If the parties are unable to agree on a single arbitrator as required under Subsection                               d  ii , the parties shall select a panel of three arbitrators.                                 e   If the parties select a panel of three arbitrators under Subsection     d  iii                                   i   each side shall select one arbitrator  and                                 ii   the arbitrators appointed under Subsection     e  i  shall select one additional                              arbitrator to be included in the panel.                                 f   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing                                  i   each party shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator selected                           under Subsection     d  i   or                                 ii   if an arbitration panel is selected under Subsection     d  iii

arbitrator selected                           under Subsection     e  ii .                                 g   Except as otherwise provided in this section or unless otherwise agreed to in                           writing by the parties, an arbitration proceeding conducted under this section shall be governed                           by Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Uniform Arbitration Act.                                 h   The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with Rules    through   ,   , and                              of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.

arbitration panel                           shall constitute a final decision.                                 k   i   The amount of an arbitration award may not exceed the underinsured motorist                           policy limits of all applicable underinsured motorist policies, including applicable underinsured                           motorist umbrella policies.                                 ii   If the initial arbitration award exceeds the underinsured motorist policy limits of all                           applicable underinsured motorist policies, the arbitration award shall be reduced to an amount                           equal to the combined underinsured motorist policy limits of all applicable underinsured                           motorist policies.

the claimant is a covered person                                  ii   whether the policy extends coverage to the loss  or                                 iii   any allegations or claims asserting consequential damages or bad faith liability.                                    m   The arbitrator or arbitration panel may not conduct arbitration on a class wide or                           class representative basis.                                 n   If the arbitrator or arbitration panel finds that the action was not brought, pursued,                           or defended in good faith, the arbitrator or arbitration panel may award reasonable attorney fees                           and costs against the party that failed to bring, pursue, or defend the claim in good faith.                                 o   An arbitration award issued under this section shall be the final resolution of all                           claims not excluded by Subsection     l  between the parties unless                                  i   the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means  or                                 ii   either party, within    days after service of the
