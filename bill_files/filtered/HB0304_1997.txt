Any motor vehicle, as defined in Section         , used in the commission of a          violation of Section           ,           ,           ,           , or            is subject          to civil forfeiture and no property right exists in it.                   A motor vehicle subject to forfeiture under Subsection     may be seized by any peace          officer of this state upon process issued by any court having jurisdiction over the property.           However, seizure without process may be made when                a   the seizure is incident to an arrest or search under a search warrant, an inspection under          an administrative inspection warrant, under a writ of attachment, or under a writ of garnishment                b   the motor vehicle subject to seizure has been the subject of a prior judgment in favor          of the state in a criminal injunction or forfeiture proceeding under this section  or               c   the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the motor vehicle has been used in          violation of Section           ,           ,           ,           , or           .                   In the event of seizure under Subsection    , proceedings under Subsection     shall          be instituted promptly.                   A motor vehicle taken or detained under this section is not repleviable but is in custody         of the law enforcement agency making the seizure, subject only to the orders and decrees of the         court or the official having jurisdiction.  When a motor vehicle is seized under this section, the         appropriate person or agency may               a   place the motor vehicle under seal               b   remove the motor vehicle to a place designated by the person or agency or the warrant         under which it was seized  or              c   take custody of the motor vehicle and remove it to an appropriate location for         disposition in accordance with law.                   When a motor vehicle is subject to civil forfeiture, a determination for forfeiture to the          state shall be made as follows                a   A complaint verified on oath or affirmation shall be prepared by the prosecuting          agency where the motor vehicle was seized or is to be seized.  A complaint shall be filed in the          district court.  The complaint shall describe with reasonable particularity                i   the motor vehicle which is the subject matter of the proceedings, including, if known,          the make, model, year, and license plate number                ii   the date and place of seizure, if known  and               iii   the allegations which constitute a basis for forfeiture.               b   Upon filing the complaint, the clerk of the court shall immediately issue a warrant for          seizure of the motor vehicle which is the subject matter of the action and deliver it to a peace          officer for service, unless the motor vehicle has previously been seized without a warrant under          Subsection    .  If the motor vehicle was seized under Subsection    , the warrant of seizure shall          be delivered to the officer having custody of the motor vehicle who shall proceed as directed in          the warrant.               c   Notice of the seizure and intended forfeiture shall be filed with the county clerk, and          served together with a copy of the complaint, upon all persons known to the prosecuting agency          to have a claim in the motor vehicle by one of the following methods                i   upon each claimant whose name and address is known, at the last known address of the          claimant, or upon each owner whose right, title, or interest is of record in the Division of Motor          Vehicles, by mailing a copy of the notice and complaint by certified mail to the address given upon          the records of the division, which service is considered complete even though the mail is refused                 or cannot be forwarded  and              ii   upon all other claimants whose addresses are unknown, but who are believed to have         an interest in the motor vehicle, by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the         county where the seizure was made.              d   Except under Subsection     e , any claimant or interested party shall file with the         court a verified answer to the complaint within    days after service has been obtained.              e   When a motor vehicle is seized under this section, any interested person or claimant         of the motor vehicle, prior to being served with a complaint under this section, may file a petition         in the court having jurisdiction for release of their interest in the motor vehicle.  The petition shall          specify the claimant s interest in the motor vehicle and their right to have it released.  A copy shall          be served upon the county attorney in the county of the seizure, who shall answer the petition          within    days.  A petitioner need not answer a complaint of forfeiture.               f   After    days following service of a complaint or petition for release, the court shall          examine the record and if no answer is on file, the court shall allow the complainant or petitioner          an opportunity to present evidence in support of their claim and order forfeiture or release of the          motor vehicle as the court determines.  If a prosecuting agency has not filed an answer to a petition          for release and the court determines from the evidence that the petitioner is not entitled to recovery          of the motor vehicle, it shall enter an order directing the prosecuting agency to answer the petition          within ten days.  If no answer is filed within that period, the court shall order the release of the          motor vehicle to the petitioner.               g   When an answer to a complaint or petition appears of record at the end of    days, the          court shall set the matter for hearing within    days.  At this hearing all interested parties may          present evidence of their rights of release of the motor vehicle following the state s evidence for          forfeiture.  The court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence the issues in the case and          order forfeiture or release of the motor vehicle as it determines.               h   When the court determines that claimants have no right in the motor vehicle in whole          or in part, it shall declare the motor vehicle to be forfeited and direct it to be delivered as provided          in Subsection    .               i   When the court determines that a motor vehicle, in whole or in part, is not subject to          forfeiture, it shall order release of the motor vehicle to the proper claimant.  If the court determines          that the motor vehicle is subject to forfeiture in part and release in part, it shall order it sold and                 the proceeds distributed               i   first, to defray the costs of the action, including seizure, storage of the motor vehicle,         legal costs of filing and pursuing the forfeiture, and costs of sale               ii   second, proportionally among the legitimate claimants  and              iii   third, as provided under Subsection    .                  a   Disposition of all motor vehicles forfeited under Subsections     through     by a         finding of the court that no person is entitled to recover the motor vehicle shall be to the seizing         agency upon a petition by the seizing agency of the motor vehicle in the complaint filed under         Subsection     a  and a finding by the court that the seizing agency is able to use the forfeited          motor vehicle in the enforcement of offenses under Title    and Title   , Chapter   .               b   If the seizing agency makes no application or the court does not make a finding under          Subsection     a  that the seizing agency should be awarded the motor vehicle, the motor vehicle          shall be deposited in the custody of the Division of Finance, to be disposed of by public bidding          or, as considered appropriate, by destruction.  Proceeds from the sale of the motor vehicle under          this Subsection     b  shall be deposited in the General Fund.               c   The court may restrain or stay the sale or disposition of the motor vehicle pending the          conclusion of any appeal of the criminal case giving rise to the forfeiture, if the applicant          demonstrates that proceeding with the sale or disposition of the motor vehicle would result in          irreparable injury, harm, or loss to him.               d   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection     b , the proceeds of any sale of a          motor vehicle forfeited under this section shall be used first to pay the expenses of the forfeiture          and the sale including expenses of seizure, maintenance, and custody of the motor vehicle pending          its disposition, advertising, and court costs.               e   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the state shall search the lien          records applicable to the motor vehicle to determine whether any valid lien against the motor          vehicle has been perfected.  As long as the lien holder did not violate the provisions of this section,          title to the motor vehicle shall be subject to the lien, and the state will either give possession of the          motor vehicle to the lien holder or pay to the lien holder the amount secured by the lien.                   In a proceeding under this section where forfeiture is declared and the vehicle is          destroyed, the court may assess all costs of the forfeiture proceeding including the costs incurred          by the prosecuting agency prosecuting the forfeiture and seizure and storage of the motor vehicle                 against the individual or individuals whose conduct was the basis for the forfeiture.                  Proceedings under this section are independent of any other proceedings whether civil         or criminal under this section or the laws of this state.
