applicable federal and state law  surface or ground waters and that               ii   the final contour of the waste accumulation will be compatible with natural        surroundings  and  that              iii   the site is stabilized and revegetated according to the provisions of this section.              e   Design      In accordance with the standards and criteria developed pursuant to Section                , the operator shall design, locate, construct, operate, maintain, enlarge, modify, and        remove or abandon  in accordance with the standards and criteria developed pursuant to Section                  all existing and new coal mine waste piles consisting of mine wastes, tailings, coal        processing wastes, or other liquid and solid wastes that are used either temporarily or permanently                as dams or embankments.              f   Establish       The operator shall establish on regraded areas and all other lands        affected, a diverse and permanent vegetative cover that is              a   capable of self regeneration and plant succession  and             b   at least equal in extent of cover to the natural vegetation of the area.              g   Protect       The operator shall protect offsite areas from damages which may result        from the mining operations.              h   Eliminate        The operator shall eliminate fire hazards and  otherwise eliminate          other conditions which constitute a hazard to health and safety of the public.              i   Minimize        The operator shall minimize the disturbances of the prevailing        hydrologic balance at the mine site and in associated offsite areas and to the quantity of water in        surface and groundwater systems both during and after coal mining operations and during        reclamation by               i    a   avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by such measures as, but not limited to               A    i   preventing or removing water from contact with toxic producing deposits               B    ii   treating drainage to reduce toxic content which adversely affects downstream        water upon being released to water courses  or              C    iii   casing, sealing, or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, and wells to keep acid        or other toxic drainage from entering ground and surface waters .                ii    b   conducting surface coal mining operations  so as  to prevent, to the extent possible        using the best technology currently available, additional contributions of suspended solids to
