Highlighted Provisions                                This bill                                .    makes a legislative finding that it is generally in the best interest of a child to be                           adopted by a person or persons who are in a legally valid and binding marriage                           under the laws of Utah                                .    prohibits adoption by a person who is cohabiting in a relationship that is not a                           legally valid and binding marriage under the laws of Utah, unless                                    .    the parent or parents of the child consent otherwise  or                                    .    the child is in the legal custody of the Division of Child and Family Services                            and                               .    makes technical changes.

Section      B           is amended to read                                   B      .  Legislative intent and findings    Best interest of child    Interests of                           each party.                                    It is the intent and desire of the Legislature that in every adoption the best interest                           of the child should govern and be of foremost concern in the court s determination.                                    The court shall make a specific finding regarding the best interest of the child,                           taking into consideration information provided to the court pursuant to the requirements of this                           chapter relating to the health, safety, and welfare of the child and the moral climate of the                           potential adoptive placement.                                    The Legislature finds that the rights and interests of all parties affected by an                           adoption proceeding must be considered and balanced in determining what constitutional                           protections and processes are necessary and appropriate.                                    The Legislature specifically finds that it is  not  generally in a child s best interest to                           be adopted by a person or persons who are  cohabiting in a relationship that is not  in a legally                           valid and binding marriage under the laws of this state.   Nothing in this section limits or                          prohibits the court s placement of a child with a single  adult who is not cohabiting as defined                          in this part.                                     The Legislature also finds that                                 a   the state has a compelling interest in providing stable and permanent homes for                           adoptive children in a prompt manner, in preventing the disruption of adoptive placements, and                           in holding parents accountable for meeting the needs of children                                 b   an unmarried mother, faced with the responsibility of making crucial decisions                           about the future of a newborn child, is entitled to privacy, and has the right to make timely and                           appropriate decisions regarding her future and the future of the child, and is entitled to                           assurance regarding the permanence of an adoptive placement                                 c   adoptive children have a right to permanence and stability in adoptive placements                                    d   adoptive parents have a constitutionally protected liberty and privacy interest in                           retaining custody of an adopted child                                 e   an unmarried biological father has an inchoate interest that acquires constitutional                           protection only when he demonstrates a timely and full commitment to the responsibilities of                           parenthood, both during pregnancy and upon the child s birth  and                                f    the state has a compelling interest in requiring unmarried biological fathers to                           demonstrate commitment by providing appropriate medical care and financial support and by                           establishing legal paternity, in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.                                    a   In enacting this chapter, the Legislature has prescribed the conditions for                           determining whether an unmarried biological father s action is sufficiently prompt and                           substantial to require constitutional protection.                                b   If an unmarried biological father fails to grasp the opportunities to establish a                           relationship with his child that are available to him, his biological parental interest may be lost                           entirely, or greatly diminished in constitutional significance by his failure to timely exercise it,                           or by his failure to strictly comply with the available legal steps to substantiate it.                                c   A certain degree of finality is necessary in order to facilitate the state s compelling                           interest.  The Legislature finds that the interests of the state, the mother, the child, and the                           adoptive parents described in this section outweigh the interest of an unmarried biological                           father who does not timely grasp the opportunity to establish and demonstrate a relationship                           with his child in accordance with the requirements of this chapter.                                d   The Legislature finds no practical way to remove all risk of fraud or                           misrepresentation in adoption proceedings, and has provided a method for absolute protection                           of an unmarried biological father s rights by compliance with the provisions of this chapter.  In                           balancing the rights and interests of the state, and of all parties affected by fraud, specifically                           the child, the adoptive parents, and the unmarried biological father, the Legislature has                           determined that the unmarried biological father is in the best position to prevent or ameliorate                           the effects of fraud and that, therefore, the burden of fraud shall be borne by him.                                e   An unmarried biological father has the primary responsibility to protect his rights.                                f   An unmarried biological father is presumed to know that the child may be adopted                           without his consent unless he strictly complies with the provisions of this chapter, manifests a                           prompt and full commitment to his parental responsibilities, and establishes paternity.                                       The Legislature finds that an unmarried mother has a right of privacy with regard to                           her pregnancy and adoption plan, and therefore has no legal obligation to disclose the identity                           of an unmarried biological father prior to or during an adoption proceeding, and has no                           obligation to volunteer information to the court with respect to the father.                               Section  .    Section      B           is amended to read                                   B      .  Who may adopt    Adoption of minor    Adoption of adult.
