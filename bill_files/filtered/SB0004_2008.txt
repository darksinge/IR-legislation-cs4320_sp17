               i   are estimates only                                  ii   may include any operations and maintenance costs already funded in existing agency                           budgets  and                                 iii   are not commitments by this Legislature or future Legislatures to fund those                           operations and maintenance costs.                                     a   The amounts funded as listed in Subsection     are estimates only and do not                           constitute a limitation on the amount that may be expended for any project.                                 b   The board may revise these estimates and redistribute the amount estimated for a                           project among the projects authorized.                                 c   The commission, by resolution and in consultation with the board, may delete one or                           more projects from this list if the inclusion of that project or those projects in the list could be                           construed to violate state law or federal law or regulation.                                     a   The division may enter into agreements related to these projects before the                           receipt of proceeds of bonds issued under this chapter.                                 b   The division shall make those expenditures from unexpended and unencumbered                           building funds already appropriated to the Capital Projects Fund.                                 c   The division shall reimburse the Capital Projects Fund upon receipt of the proceeds                           of bonds issued under this chapter.                                 d   The state intends to use proceeds of tax exempt bonds to reimburse itself for                           expenditures for costs of the projects listed in Subsection     c .                                     It is the intent of the Legislature that the funding authorized for projects in                           Subsection     does not include funds for public art.
