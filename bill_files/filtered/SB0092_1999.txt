Upon timely application, the division may intervene in a private civil action brought                      under this subsection if the division certifies that the case is of general importance.                               In a private civil action, if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has                      occurred or is about to occur, the court may                            a   order the respondent to cease any discriminatory housing practice                            b   award to the plaintiff actual damages, punitive damages and reasonable attorneys  fees                      and costs  and                           c   grant, as the court considers appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction,                      temporary restraining order, or other order as may be appropriate, including civil penalties under                      Section                 .                               This chapter does not preclude any private right of action by an aggrieved person based                      on otherwise applicable law not included in this chapter.
