Section  .   Effective date.                                This bill takes effect on October  ,     .      Legislative Review Note      as of                 AM   This legislation authorizes a Respect Choice special group license plate.  This legislation might  be challenged on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment of the United States  Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has not decided a case addressing the issuance  of special group license plates. However, at least one federal district court has held that the  issuance of a special plate constitutes private speech that is unconstitutional viewpoint  discrimination if the license plate is issued pursuant to the uncontrolled discretion of the  legislature.  Planned Parenthood v. Rose,     F. Supp.  d      D.S.C.         See also, Sons  of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles,      F. d       th Cir.      .   This legislation also requires a contribution of at least     annually to Respect Choice, Inc., a  private non profit entity, in order to purchase a Respect Choice special group license plate.   Article VI, Section    of the Utah Constitution prohibits special legislation.  The Utah  Supreme Court has defined special legislation as legislation that classifies its objects  unreasonably, by selecting from a class of particular persons, places, or things for the purpose  of conferring privileges or imposing burdens. It is unclear whether a court would determine  that requiring a contribution of at least     annually to Respect Choice, Inc., if a person  chooses to purchase a Respect Choice special group license plate, is unconstitutional special  legislation.  If a court finds that the classification is reasonable and that general legislation is  unable to cover the same issues that the special legislation covers, a court would likely uphold  the Legislature s action.
