As used in this section                                   a    Critical management area  means a groundwater basin in which the groundwater                             withdrawals consistently exceed the safe yield.                                  b    Safe yield  means the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a                             groundwater basin over a period of time without exceeding the long term recharge of the basin                             or unreasonably affecting the basin s physical and chemical integrity.                                      a   The state engineer may regulate groundwater withdrawals within a specific                             groundwater basin by adopting a groundwater management plan in accordance with this section                             for any groundwater basin or aquifer or combination of hydrologically connected groundwater                             basins or aquifers.                                  b   The objectives of a groundwater management plan are to                                   i   limit groundwater withdrawals to safe yield                                   ii   protect the physical integrity of the aquifer  and                                  iii   protect water quality.                                  c   The state engineer shall adopt a groundwater management plan for a groundwater                             basin if more than     of the water right owners in the groundwater basin request that the state                             engineer adopt a groundwater management plan.                                      a   In developing a groundwater management plan, the state engineer may consider                                   i   the hydrology of the groundwater basin                                   ii   the physical characteristics of the groundwater basin                                   iii   the relationship between surface water and groundwater, including whether the                             groundwater should be managed in conjunction with hydrologically connected surface waters                                   iv   the geographic spacing and location of groundwater withdrawals                                   v   water quality                                   vi   local well interference  and                                  vii   other relevant factors.                                  b   The state engineer shall base the provisions of a groundwater management plan on                             the principles of prior appropriation.                                     c   i   The state engineer shall use the best available scientific method to determine                             safe yield.                                  ii   As hydrologic conditions change or additional information becomes available, safe                             yield determinations made by the state engineer may be revised by following the procedures                             listed in Subsection    .                                      a   i   Except as provided in Subsection     b , the withdrawal of water from a                             groundwater basin shall be limited to the basin s safe yield.                                  ii   Before limiting withdrawals in a groundwater basin to safe yield, the state engineer                             shall                                   A   determine the groundwater basin s safe yield  and                                  B   adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater basin.                                  iii   If the state engineer determines that groundwater withdrawals in a groundwater                             basin exceed the safe yield, the state engineer shall regulate groundwater rights in that                             groundwater basin based on the priority date of the water rights under the groundwater                             management plan, unless a voluntary arrangement exists under Subsection     c  that requires a                             different distribution.                                  b   When adopting a groundwater management plan for a critical management area, the                             state engineer shall, based on economic and other impacts to an individual water user or a local                             community caused by the implementation of safe yield limits on withdrawals, allow gradual                             implementation of the groundwater management plan.                                  c   i   In consultation with the state engineer, water users in a groundwater basin may                             agree to participate in a voluntary arrangement for managing withdrawals at any time, either                             before or after a determination that groundwater withdrawals exceed the groundwater basin s                             safe yield.                                  ii   A voluntary arrangement under Subsection     c  i  shall be consistent with other                             law.

A groundwater management plan may be amended in the same manner as a                             groundwater management plan may be adopted under this section.                                         The existence of a groundwater management plan does not preclude any otherwise                             eligible person from filing any application or challenging any decision made by the state                             engineer within the affected groundwater basin.                                       a   A person aggrieved by a groundwater management plan may challenge any                             aspect of the groundwater management plan by filing a complaint within    days after the                             adoption of the groundwater management plan in the district court for any county in which the                             groundwater basin is found.                                  b   Notwithstanding Subsection    , a person may challenge the components of a                             groundwater management plan only in the manner provided by Subsection      a .                                  c   An action brought under this Subsection      is reviewed de novo by the district                             court.                                  d   A person challenging a groundwater management plan under this Subsection                                  shall join the state engineer as a defendant in the action challenging the groundwater                             management plan.                                  e   i   Within    days after the day on which a person files an action challenging any                             aspect of a groundwater management plan under Subsection      a , the person filing the action                             shall publish notice of the action in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which                             the district court is located.                                  ii   The notice required by Subsection      e  i  shall be published once a week for two                             consecutive weeks.                                  iii   The notice required by Subsection      e  i  shall                                   A   identify the groundwater management plan the person is challenging                                   B   identify the case number assigned by the district court                                   C   state that a person affected by the groundwater management plan may petition the                             district court to intervene in the action challenging the groundwater management plan  and                                  D   list the address for the clerk of the district court in which the action is filed.                                  iv   A   Any person affected by the groundwater management plan may petition to                             intervene in the action within    days after the day on which notice is last published under                                Subsections      e  i  and  ii .                                  B   The district court s treatment of a petition to intervene under this Subsection                                  e  iv  is governed by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.                                  v   A district court in which an action is brought under Subsection      a  shall                             consolidate all actions brought under that subsection and include in the consolidated action any                             person whose petition to intervene is granted.                                       A groundwater management plan adopted or amended in accordance with this                             section is exempt from the requirements in Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Administrative                             Rulemaking Act.
