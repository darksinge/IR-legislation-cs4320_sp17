The Legislature finds that there is a statewide purpose and need to consolidate the                            management of     emergency services and communications in the state and to create a                            statewide computer aided dispatch platform.  In order to improve unified statewide emergency                            services, the Utah Communications Agency Network shall be renamed the Utah                            Communications Authority and shall be consolidated with the Utah     Committee, the                            Statewide Communications and Interoperability Committee, and the radio services within the                            Department of Technology Services.  The consolidation of services management and assets                               creates a unique opportunity to improve the development, delivery, and administration of                            unified statewide     emergency services, radio, and radio interoperability.
