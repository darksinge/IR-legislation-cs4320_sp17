Section  .  Section   B        is amended to read               B       . Establishment of parent child relationship.                 a   The mother child relationship is established between a woman and a child by               a    i   the woman s having given birth to the child, except as otherwise provided in       Part  , Gestational Agreement               b    ii   an adjudication of the woman s maternity               c    iii   adoption of the child by the woman   or               d    iv   an adjudication confirming the woman as a parent of a child born to a       gestational mother if the agreement was validated under Part  , Gestational Agreement, or is       enforceable under other law .   or             v   an unrebutted presumption of maternity of the child established in the same manner       as under Section   B       .             b   In this chapter, the presumption of maternity shall be treated the same as a       presumption of paternity as established in Subsection   B           a .                 The father child relationship is established between a man and a child by               a   an unrebutted presumption of the man s paternity of the child under Section          B                      b   an effective declaration of paternity by the man under Part  , Voluntary Declaration        of Paternity Act, unless the declaration has been rescinded or successfully challenged               c   an adjudication of the man s paternity               d   adoption of the child by the man               e   the man having consented to assisted reproduction by a woman under Part  ,        Assisted Reproduction, which resulted in the birth of the child  or              f   an adjudication confirming the man as a parent of a child born to a gestational        mother if the agreement was validated under Part  , Gestational Agreement, or is enforceable        under other law.             Section  .  Section   B        is amended to read                B       . Limitation    Child having presumed father.                  Paternity of a child conceived or born during a marriage with a presumed father, as        described in Subsection   B           a ,  b , or  c , may be raised by the presumed father         or , the mother, or a support enforcement agency at any time  prior to  before filing an action        for divorce or in the pleadings at the time of the divorce of the parents.              a   If the issue is raised prior to the adjudication, genetic testing may be ordered by the        tribunal in accordance with Section   B       .  Failure of the mother of the child to appear        for testing may result in an order allowing a motherless calculation of paternity.  Failure of the        mother to make the child available may not result in a determination that the presumed father is        not the father, but shall allow for appropriate proceedings to compel the cooperation of the        mother.  If the question of paternity has been raised in the pleadings in a divorce and the        tribunal addresses the issue and enters an order, the parties are estopped from raising the issue        again, and the order of the tribunal may not be challenged on the basis of material mistake of        fact.              b   If the presumed father seeks to rebut the presumption of paternity, then denial of a        motion seeking an order for genetic testing or a decision to disregard genetic test results shall        be based on a preponderance of the evidence.              c   If the mother seeks to rebut the presumption of paternity, the mother has the burden        to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would be in the best interests of the child to        disestablish the parent child relationship.              d   If a support enforcement agency seeks to rebut the presumption of parentage and        the presumptive parent opposes the rebuttal, the agency s request shall be denied.  Otherwise,        the denial of the agency s motion seeking an order for genetic testing or a decision to disregard        genetic test results shall be based on a preponderance of the evidence, taking into account the        best interests of the child.                  For the presumption outside of marriage described in Subsection   B           d ,        the presumption may be rebutted at any time if the tribunal determines that the presumed father        and the mother of the child neither cohabited nor engaged in sexual intercourse with each other        during the probable time of conception.                  The presumption may be rebutted by               a   genetic test results that exclude the presumed father               b   genetic test results that rebuttably identify another man as the father in accordance        with Section   B                      c   evidence that the presumed father and the mother of the child neither cohabited nor        engaged in sexual intercourse with each other during the probable time of conception  or              d   an adjudication under this part.                  There is no presumption to rebut if the presumed father was properly served and        there has been a final adjudication of the issue.
