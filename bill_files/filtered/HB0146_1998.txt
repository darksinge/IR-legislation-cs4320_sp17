If a person is convicted in this state of a violent felony by plea or by verdict and the          sentencing court determines the person is a habitual violent offender under this section, the penalty          for a                a   third degree felony shall be as if the conviction were for a first degree felony                b   second degree felony shall be as if the conviction were for a first degree felony  or               c   first degree felony shall remain the penalty for a first degree penalty except                i   the convicted person is not eligible for probation  and               ii   the Board of Pardons and Parole shall consider that the convicted person is a habitual          violent offender as an aggravating factor to determine the length of incarceration.                   a   In all cases, notice that the prosecution intends to seek punishment as a habitual          violent offender under this section shall be provided in writing and shall be served upon the          defendant or his attorney not later than ten days prior to trial.  Notice shall include the case                 number, court, and date of conviction or commitment of any case relied upon by the prosecution.              b   i   The defendant shall serve notice in writing upon the prosecutor if the defendant         intends to deny that               A   the defendant is the person who was convicted or committed               B   the defendant was represented by counsel or had waived counsel  or              C   the defendant s plea was understandingly or voluntarily entered.              ii   The notice of denial shall be served not later than five days prior to trial and shall state         in detail the defendant s contention regarding the previous conviction and commitment.              c   The court shall determine if this section applies prior to or at the time of sentencing.           The court shall consider any evidence presented at trial and a shall afford the prosecution and the          defendant an opportunity to present any necessary additional evidence.  Prior to sentencing under          this section, the court shall determine whether this section is applicable by a preponderance of the          evidence.               d   If any previous conviction and commitment is based upon a plea of guilty or no          contest, there is a rebuttable presumption that the conviction and commitment were regular and          lawful in all respects if the conviction and commitment occurred after January  ,     .  If the          conviction and commitment occurred prior to January  ,     , the burden is on the prosecution          to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was then represented by counsel          or had lawfully waived his right to have counsel present, and that his plea was understandingly and          voluntarily entered.               e   If the court finds this section applicable, it shall enter that specific finding on the record          and shall indicate in the order of judgment and commitment that the defendant has been found by          the court to be a habitual violent offender and is sentenced under this section.                   The habitual violent offender provisions of this section are not an element of the          offense, and proof of a defendant s conduct as a habitual violent offender is not necessary at a          preliminary hearing or at trial.                   a   The sentencing enhancement provisions of Sections          and          shall          apply to a felony conviction defined in Title   , Chapter  , Part  , Sexual Offenses, and shall          supersede the provisions of this section.               b   Notwithstanding Subsection     a                 i   the convictions under Sections          and     a   shall be governed by the                 enhancement provisions of this section  and              ii   the  violent felony  offense defined in Subsection     c  shall include any felony         sexual offense violation of Title   , Chapter  , Part  , Sexual Offenses, to determine if the         convicted person is a habitual violent offender.
