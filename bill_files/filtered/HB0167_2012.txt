Subsection     c ,  additional motor vehicle  means a change                           that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include                           replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.                                 ii   The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or                           commercial lines policy does not constitute a  new policy  for purposes of Subsection     b .                                 iii   If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where uninsured                           motorist coverage has been rejected, or where uninsured motorist limits are lower than the                           named insured s motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice to a named                           insured within thirty days that                                  A   reasonably explains the purpose of uninsured motorist

required to purchase uninsured motorist                           coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle                              liability coverage or the maximum uninsured motorist coverage limits available by the insurer                           under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.                                 d   A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under                           Subsection     b  ii  does not constitute a new policy.                                 e   i   Subsection     b  applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after January  ,                                for which, as of May  ,     , an insured has not made a written demand for arbitration or                           filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.                                 ii   The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection                                      A   does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights  and                                 B   clarifies legislative intent.                                  c    f   A self insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide                            uninsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self insured retention                            under Subsections      b       a  and           a  by issuing a declaratory memorandum or                            policy statement from the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that declares the                                  i   self insured entity s coverage level  and                                 ii   process for filing an uninsured motorist claim.                                  d    g   Uninsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than the                            minimum bodily injury limits for motor vehicle liability policies under Section       A           .                                  e    h   The acknowledgment under Subsection      b       a  continues for that issuer                            of the uninsured motorist coverage until the named insured requests, in writing,  requests                             different uninsured motorist coverage from the insurer.                                  f    i   i   In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January  ,     ,                            for policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium                            renewal notice, an explanation of                                  A   the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage  and

the lesser of the limits of the named insured s                            motor vehicle liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits                            available by the insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy, unless  the  a named                            insured rejects or purchases coverage in a lesser amount by signing an acknowledgment form                               that                                  i   is filed with the department                                  ii   is provided by the insurer                                  iii

premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist                            coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle                            liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                            insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.                                 b   For purposes of this Subsection    ,  new policy  means                                  i   any policy that is issued which does not include a renewal or reinstatement of an                           existing policy  or                                 ii   a change to an existing policy that results in                                  A   a named insured being added to or deleted from the policy  or                                 B   a change in the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle liability coverage.                                 c   i   As used in this Subsection     c ,  additional motor vehicle  means a change                           that increases the total number of vehicles insured by the policy, and does not include                           replacement, substitute, or temporary vehicles.                                 ii   The adding of an additional motor vehicle to an existing personal lines or                           commercial lines policy does not constitute a  new policy  for purposes of Subsection     b .                                 iii   If an additional motor vehicle is added to a personal lines policy where                           underinsured motorist coverage has been rejected, or where underinsured motorist limits are                           lower than the named insured s motor vehicle liability limits, the insurer shall provide a notice                           to a named insured within thirty days that                                  A   reasonably explains the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and                                 B   encourages the named insured to contact the insurance company or insurance                           producer for quotes as to the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist                           coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle                           liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                           insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.                                 d   A change in policy number resulting from any policy change not identified under                              Subsection     b  ii  does not constitute a new policy.                                 e   i   Subsection     b  applies retroactively to any claim arising on or after January  ,                                for which, as of May  ,     , an insured has not made a written demand for arbitration or                           filed a complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.                                 ii   The Legislature finds that the retroactive application of Subsection                                      A   does not enlarge, eliminate, or destroy vested rights  and                                 B   clarifies legislative intent.                                  c    f   A self insured, including a governmental entity, may elect to provide                            underinsured motorist coverage in an amount that is less than its maximum self insured                            retention under Subsections      b       a  and      g       j  by issuing a declaratory                            memorandum or policy statement from the chief financial officer or chief risk officer that                            declares the                                  i   self insured entity s coverage level  and                                 ii   process for filing an underinsured motorist claim.                                  d    g   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be sold with limits that are less than                                  i      ,    for one person in any one accident  and                                 ii   at least    ,    for two or more persons in any one accident.                                  e    h   An acknowledgment under Subsection      b       a  continues for that issuer                            of the underinsured motorist coverage until the named insured, in writing, requests different                            underinsured motorist coverage from the insurer.                                  f    i   i   The named insured s underinsured motorist coverage, as described in                            Subsection      a  , is secondary to the liability coverage of an owner or operator of an                            underinsured motor vehicle, as described in Subsection    .                                 ii   Underinsured motorist coverage may not be set off against the liability coverage of                            the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle, but shall be added to, combined with,                            or stacked upon the liability coverage of the owner or operator of the underinsured motor                            vehicle to determine the limit of coverage available to the injured person.                                  g   i   A named insured may reject underinsured motorist coverage by an express                           writing to the insurer that provides liability coverage under Subsection       A               a .                                   ii   A written rejection under this Subsection     g  shall be on a form provided by the                           insurer that includes a reasonable explanation of the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage                              and when it would be applicable.                                   iii   A written rejection under this Subsection     g  continues for that issuer of the                           liability coverage until the insured in writing requests underinsured motorist coverage from that                           liability insurer.                                  j   i   In conjunction with the first two renewal notices sent after January  ,     , for                           policies existing on that date, the insurer shall disclose in the same medium as the premium                           renewal notice, an explanation of                                  A   the purpose of underinsured motorist coverage  and                                 B   a disclosure of the additional premiums required to purchase underinsured motorist                           coverage with limits equal to the lesser of the limits of the named insured s motor vehicle                           liability coverage or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage limits available by the                           insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.                                 ii   The disclosure required under this Subsection     j  shall be sent to all named                           insureds that carry underinsured motorist coverage limits in an amount less than the named                           insured s motor vehicle liability policy limits or the maximum underinsured motorist coverage                           limits available by the insurer under the named insured s motor vehicle policy.                                 k   For purposes of this Subsection    , a notice or disclosure sent to a named insured                           in a household constitutes notice or disclosure to all insureds within the household.                                           a   i   Except as provided in this Subsection          , a covered person injured                            in a motor vehicle described in a policy that includes underinsured motorist benefits may not                            elect to collect underinsured motorist coverage benefits from another motor vehicle insurance                            policy.                                 ii   The limit of liability for underinsured motorist coverage for two or more motor                            vehicles may not be added together, combined, or stacked to determine the limit of insurance                            coverage available to an injured person for any one accident.                                 iii   Subsection           a  ii  applies to all persons except a covered person described                            under Subsections           b  i  and  ii .                                 b   i   Except as provided in Subsection           b  ii , a covered person injured while                            occupying, using, or maintaining a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or furnished to the                            covered person, the covered person s spouse, or the covered person s resident parent or resident                            sibling, may also recover benefits under any one other policy under which the covered person is                               also a covered person.                                 ii   A   A covered person may recover benefits from no more than two additional                            policies, one additional policy from each parent s household if the covered person is                                  I   a dependent minor of parents who reside in separate households  and                                 II   injured while occupying or using a motor vehicle that is not owned, leased, or                            furnished to the covered person, the covered person s resident parent, or the covered person s                            resident sibling.                                 B   Each parent s policy under this Subsection           b  ii  is liable only for the                            percentage of the damages that the limit of liability of each parent s policy of underinsured                            motorist coverage bears to the total of both parents  underinsured coverage applicable to the                            accident.                                 iii   A covered person s recovery under any available policies may not exceed the full                            amount of damages.                                 iv   Underinsured coverage on a motor vehicle occupied at the time of an accident is                            primary coverage, and the coverage elected by a person described under Subsections                               A               a  and  b  is secondary coverage.                                 v   The primary and the secondary coverage may not be set off against the other.                                 vi   A covered person as described under Subsection           b  i  is entitled to the                            highest limits of underinsured motorist coverage under only one additional policy per                            household applicable to that covered person as a named insured, spouse, or relative.                                 vii   A covered injured person is not barred against making subsequent elections if                            recovery is unavailable under previous elections.                                 viii   A   As used in this section,  interpolicy stacking  means recovering benefits for a                            single incident of loss under more than one insurance policy.                                 B   Except to the extent permitted by this Subsection          , interpolicy stacking is                            prohibited for underinsured motorist coverage.                                 c   Underinsured motorist coverage                                  i   is secondary to the benefits provided by Title   A, Chapter  , Workers                             Compensation Act                                  ii   may not be subrogated by a workers  compensation insurance carrier                                  iii   may not be reduced by benefits provided by workers  compensation insurance                                     iv   may be reduced by health insurance subrogation only after the covered person is                            made whole                                  v   may not be collected for bodily injury or death sustained by a person                                  A   while committing a violation of Section         a                                           B   who, as a passenger in a vehicle, has knowledge that the vehicle is being operated                            in violation of Section         a           or                                 C   while committing a felony  and                                 vi   notwithstanding Subsection           c  v , may be recovered                                  A   for a person under    years of age who is injured within the scope of Subsection                                      c  v , but is limited to medical and funeral expenses  or                                 B   by a law enforcement officer as defined in Section                  , who is injured                            within the course and scope of the law enforcement officer s duties.                                           The inception of the loss under Subsection       A               for underinsured                            motorist claims occurs upon the date of the last liability policy payment.                                           a   Within five business days after notification that all liability insurers have                            tendered their liability policy limits, the underinsured carrier shall either                                  i   waive any subrogation claim the underinsured carrier may have against the person                            liable for the injuries caused in the accident  or                                 ii   pay the insured an amount equal to the policy limits tendered by the liability carrier.                                 b   If neither option is exercised under Subsection           a , the subrogation claim is                            considered to be waived by the underinsured carrier.                                           Except as otherwise provided in this section, a covered person may seek,                            subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, additional coverage under any policy                                  a   that provides coverage for damages resulting from motor vehicle accidents  and                                 b   that is not required to conform to Section       A

the covered person s underinsured motorist                            carrier, the claimant may elect to resolve the claim                                  i   by submitting the claim to binding arbitration  or                                 ii   through litigation.                                 b   Unless otherwise provided in the policy under which underinsured benefits are                               claimed, the election provided in Subsection           a  is available to the claimant only.                                 c   Once a claimant elects to commence litigation under Subsection           a  ii , the                            claimant may not elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration under this section                            without the written consent of the underinsured motorist coverage carrier.                                 d   i   Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, a claim that is submitted to
