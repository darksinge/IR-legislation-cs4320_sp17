violation        as a measure of its seriousness.             ii   The points shall be based upon actual relationships between types of traffic violations        and motor vehicle traffic accidents.             b   Every person convicted of a traffic violation shall have assessed against his driving        record the number of points that the division has assigned to the type of violation of which the        person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be decreased by     if        on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded the severity of violation        as minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court has graded the severity of                 violation as maximum.             c   i   A separate procedure for assessing points for speeding offenses shall be established        by the division based upon the severity of the offense.             ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as              A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to  nine  ten miles per hour              B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from  ten     to

points on minimum speeding        violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.             d   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations

number of points it has assigned to each type of traffic violation,        the time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level at which the division        will

in the same manner.                 a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the        division shall immediately notify the licensee in writing and afford him an opportunity for a hearing        in the county where the licensee resides.             ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may        administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant        books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.             iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision made                 after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made after a        hearing before the full membership of the division.             iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,        extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.             b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications        determined by the division regarding a person              i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination              ii   who is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle              iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities  that might make him dangerous on        the highways  or             iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to  drive a motor vehicle safely.                 a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state upon        receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed there that,        if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a license.             b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a nonresident        driver of a motor vehicle of any offense under the motor vehicle laws of this state, forward a        certified copy of the record to the motor vehicle administrator in the state where the person        convicted is a resident.                 a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a motor        vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be suspended or        revoked.             b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when his license has been        suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                 a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of more        than one year except              i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                  ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges        under Section                                iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports under        Subsection               and             iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section              a           a    .             b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until he shows        satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.             c   Upon denying, suspending, or revoking a license, the division shall require that all        license certificates held by the person be surrendered to the division.             d   At the end of the period of denial or suspension, the certificate surrendered shall be        returned to the licensee.                 a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative        Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any person without hearing        and without receiving a record of his conviction for a crime when the division has reason to believe        that the person s license was granted by the division through error or fraud or that the necessary        consent for the license has been withdrawn or is terminated.             b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that after        the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                  a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is incompetent or        otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon written notice of at least five days to the licensee        require him to submit to an examination.             b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the person s        license, permit him to retain the license, or  grant a license subject to a restriction imposed in        accordance with Section         .             c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for suspension        or revocation of his license.                  A report authorized by Section          may not contain any evidence of a conviction        for speeding on an interstate system in this state if the conviction was for a speed of  less than            ten miles per hour or less, above the posted speed limit and did not result in an accident, unless                 authorized in writing by the individual whose report is being requested.                  a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative        Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person if it has reason to        believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is required under Title   ,        Chapter   a, Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility, and has driven the motor vehicle or permitted        it to be driven within this state without the security being in effect.             b    Sections  Section      a      and      a      regarding  the surrender of license        plates and registration of motor vehicles and  the requirement of proof of  financial responsibility        apply  owner s or operator s security applies to persons whose driving privileges are suspended        under this Subsection     .             c   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this subsection,        the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.             d   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been        revoked by the division under this subsection may file a request for agency action requesting a        hearing.                  Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also disqualifies        any license issued to that person under Part   of this chapter.            Section   .
