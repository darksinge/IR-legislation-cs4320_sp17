Except as provided in Subsection     b , if a property owner places improvements                          to land that interfere with the easement rights described in Subsection     a , the property                          owner shall bear the risk of loss or damage to those improvements resulting from the exercise                          of the easement rights described in Subsection     a .                                    Unless one of the exceptions provided in Subsection                    applies, a property                          owner may not, within a public easement, build or allow to be built any structure requiring slab                          support or footings.

A subdivision plat that includes a public utility easement may not receive final                          approval for recording by a municipality or county unless each public utility holding an interest                          in the public utility easement has been notified    calendar days prior to recording.
