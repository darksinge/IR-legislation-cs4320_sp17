Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Adjudication of jurisdiction of juvenile court    Disposition of cases             Enumeration of possible court orders    Considerations of court.                  a   When a minor is found to come within the provisions of Section     a    , the         court shall so adjudicate.  The court shall make a finding of the facts upon which it bases its         jurisdiction over the minor.  However, in cases within the provisions of Subsection     a       ,         findings of fact are not necessary.              b   If the court adjudicates a minor for a crime of violence or an offense in violation of          Title   , Chapter   , Part  , Weapons, it shall order that notice of the adjudication be provided to          the school superintendent of the district in which the minor resides or attends school.

The designated persons may receive          the information for purposes of the minor s supervision and student safety.                iii    iv   Any employee of the local law enforcement agency and the school which the          minor attends who discloses the court s order of probation is not                A   civilly liable except when the disclosure constitutes fraud or malice as provided in          Section          and               B   civilly or criminally liable except when the disclosure constitutes a knowing violation          of Section         .               b   The court may place the minor in the legal custody of a relative or other suitable                 person, with or without probation or protective supervision, but the juvenile court may not assume         the function of developing foster home services.              c   i   The court may vest legal custody of the minor in the Division of Child and Family         Services, Division of Youth Corrections, or the Division of Mental Health, and may order the         Department of Human Services to provide dispositional recommendations and services.              ii   Minors who are committed to the custody of the Division of Child and Family Services         on grounds other than abuse or neglect are subject to the provisions of Part  A and Title   A,         Chapter  a, Part  A.              d   i   The court may commit the minor to the Division of Youth Corrections for secure          confinement.               ii   A minor under the jurisdiction of the court solely on the ground of abuse, neglect, or          dependency under Subsection     a        c  may not be committed to the Division of Youth          Corrections.               e   The court may commit the minor, subject to the court retaining continuing jurisdiction          over him, to the temporary custody of the Division of Youth Corrections for observation and          evaluation for a period not to exceed    days.               f   i   The court may commit the minor to a place of detention or an alternative to          detention for a period not to exceed    days subject to the court retaining continuing jurisdiction          over the minor.                ii   Subsection     f  applies only to those minors adjudicated for an act which if          committed by an adult would be a criminal offense or for contempt of court under Section              a    .  This commitment may be stayed or suspended upon conditions ordered by the court.               g   The court may vest legal custody of an abused, neglected, or dependent minor in the          Division of Child and Family Services or any other appropriate person in accordance with the          requirements and procedures of Part  , Abuse, Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.               h   The court may place the minor on a ranch or forestry camp, or similar facility for care          and also for work, if possible, if the person, agency, or association operating the facility has been          approved or has otherwise complied with all applicable state and local laws.  A minor placed in          a forestry camp or similar facility may be required to work on fire prevention, forestation and          reforestation, recreational works, forest roads, and on other works on or off the grounds of the          facility and may be paid wages, subject to the approval of and under conditions set by the court.                      i   The court may order that the minor be required to repair, replace, or otherwise make         restitution for damage or loss caused by the minor s wrongful act, including costs of treatment as         stated in Section     a    , and may impose fines in limited amounts.              j   The court may issue orders necessary for the collection of restitution and fines ordered         by the court, including garnishments, wage withholdings, and executions.              k   i   The court may through its probation department encourage the development of         employment or work programs to enable minors to fulfill their obligations under Subsection     i          and for other purposes considered desirable by the court.              ii   Consistent with the order of the court, the probation officer may permit the minor          found to be within the jurisdiction of the court to participate in a program of work restitution or          community service in lieu of paying part or all of the fine imposed by the court.  The work          restitution or community service permitted by the probation officer may not affect the amount of          the surcharge.               l   In violations of traffic laws within the court s jurisdiction, the court may, in addition          to any other disposition, restrain the minor from driving for periods of time the court considers          necessary and take possession of the minor s driver license.  However, proceedings involving an          offense under Section     a     are governed by that section regarding suspension of driving          privileges.               m   i   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section              a     because of violating Section        , Title   , Chapter   a, Utah Drug Paraphernalia          Act, or Title   , Chapter   b, Imitation Controlled Substances Act, the court shall, in addition to          any fines or fees otherwise imposed, order that the minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no          more than     hours, of community service.  Satisfactory completion of an approved substance          abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as community service hours.               ii   When a minor is found within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under Section              a     because of a violation of Section   A        or Subsection            , the court may,          upon the first adjudication, and shall, upon a second or subsequent adjudication, order that the          minor perform a minimum of    hours, but no more than     hours of community service, in          addition to any fines or fees otherwise imposed.  Satisfactory completion of an approved substance          abuse prevention or treatment program may be credited by the court as community service hours.               n   The court may order that the minor be examined or treated by a physician, surgeon,                 psychiatrist, or psychologist or that he receive other special care.  For these purposes the court may         place the minor in a hospital or other suitable facility.              o   i   The court may appoint a guardian for the minor if it appears necessary in the interest         of the minor, and may appoint a public or private institution or agency as guardian in which legal         custody of the minor is vested.              ii   In placing a minor under the guardianship or legal custody of an individual or of a         private agency or institution, the court shall give primary consideration to the welfare of the minor.          When practicable, the court may take into consideration the religious preferences of the minor and         of the minor s parents.               p   i   In support of a decree under Section     a    , the court may order reasonable          conditions to be complied with by the parents or guardian, the minor, the minor s custodian, or any          other person who has been made a party to the proceedings.  Conditions may include                A   visitation by the parents or one parent                B   restrictions on the minor s associates                C   restrictions on the minor s occupation and other activities  and               D   requirements to be observed by the parents or custodian.               ii   A minor whose parents or guardians successfully complete a family or other          counseling program may be credited by the court for detention, confinement, or probation time.               q  The court may order the minor to be placed in the legal custody of the Division of          Mental Health or committed to the physical custody of a local mental health authority, in          accordance with the procedures and requirements of Title   A, Chapter   , Part  A, Commitment          of Persons Under Age    to Division of Mental Health.               r   The court may make an order committing a minor within its jurisdiction to the Utah          State Developmental Center if the minor has been found mentally retarded in accordance with the          provisions of Title   A, Chapter  , Part  , Admission to Mental Retardation Facility.  The          procedure applicable in the district courts with respect to judicial commitments to the Utah State          Developmental Center shall be followed by the juvenile court in these cases.               s   The court may terminate all parental rights upon a finding of compliance with the          provisions of Part  , Termination of Parental Rights Act.               t   The court may make any other reasonable orders for the best interest of the minor or          as required for the protection of the public, except that a person younger than    years of age may                 not be committed to jail or prison, and offenses under Section     a     are governed by that         section regarding suspension of driving privileges.              u   The court may combine several of the above listed modes of disposition if they are         compatible.              v   Before depriving any parent of custody, the court shall give due consideration to the         rights of parents concerning their minors.  The court may transfer custody to another person,         agency, or institution in accordance with the requirements and procedures of Part  , Abuse,         Neglect, and Dependency Proceedings.              w   Except as provided in Subsection     y  i , an order under this section for probation          or placement of a minor with an individual or an agency shall include a date certain for a review          of the case by the court.  A new date shall be set upon each review.               x   In reviewing foster home placements, special attention shall be given to making          adoptable minors available for adoption without delay.               y   i   The juvenile court may enter an order of permanent custody and guardianship with          a relative or individual of a minor where the court has previously acquired jurisdiction as a result          of an adjudication of abuse, neglect, or dependency, excluding cases arising under Subsection              a       .               ii   Such orders remain in effect until the minor reaches majority and are not subject to          review under Section     a    , but may be modified by petition or motion as provided in Section              a    .               iii   Orders permanently terminating the rights of a parent, guardian, or custodian and          permanent orders of custody and guardianship do not expire with a termination of jurisdiction of          the juvenile court.
