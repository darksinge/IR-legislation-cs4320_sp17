Section   .    Section                is amended to read                                          .  Groundwater management plan.                                      As used in this section                                   a    Critical management area  means a groundwater basin in which the groundwater                             withdrawals consistently exceed the safe yield.                                  b    Safe yield  means the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a                             groundwater basin over a period of time without exceeding the long term recharge of the basin                             or unreasonably affecting the basin s physical and chemical integrity.                                      a   The state engineer may regulate groundwater withdrawals within a specific                             groundwater basin by adopting a groundwater management plan in accordance with this section                             for any groundwater basin or aquifer or combination of hydrologically connected groundwater                             basins or aquifers.                                  b   The objectives of a groundwater management plan are to                                   i   limit groundwater withdrawals to safe yield                                   ii   protect the physical integrity of the aquifer  and                                  iii   protect water quality.                                  c   The state engineer shall adopt a groundwater management plan for a groundwater                             basin if more than     of the water right owners in the groundwater basin request that the state                                engineer adopt a groundwater management plan.                                      a   In developing a groundwater management plan, the state engineer may consider                                   i   the hydrology of the groundwater basin                                   ii   the physical characteristics of the groundwater basin                                   iii   the relationship between surface water and groundwater, including whether the                             groundwater should be managed in conjunction with hydrologically connected surface waters                                   iv   the geographic spacing and location of groundwater withdrawals                                   v   water quality                                   vi   local well interference  and                                  vii   other relevant factors.                                  b   The state engineer shall base the provisions of a groundwater management plan on                             the principles of prior appropriation.                                  c   i   The state engineer shall use the best available scientific method to determine                             safe yield.                                  ii   As hydrologic conditions change or additional information becomes available, safe                             yield determinations made by the state engineer may be revised by following the procedures                             listed in Subsection    .                                      a   i   Except as provided in Subsection     b , the withdrawal of water from a                             groundwater basin shall be limited to the basin s safe yield.                                  ii   Before limiting withdrawals in a groundwater basin to safe yield, the state engineer                             shall                                   A   determine the groundwater basin s safe yield  and                                  B   adopt a groundwater management plan for the groundwater basin.                                  iii   If the state engineer determines that groundwater withdrawals in a groundwater                             basin exceed the safe yield, the state engineer shall regulate groundwater rights in that                             groundwater basin based on the priority date of the water rights under the groundwater                             management plan, unless a voluntary arrangement exists under Subsection     c  that requires a                             different distribution.                                     b   When adopting a groundwater management plan for a critical management area, the                             state engineer shall, based on economic and other impacts to an individual water user or a local                             community caused by the implementation of safe yield limits on withdrawals, allow gradual                             implementation of the groundwater management plan.                                  c   i   In consultation with the state engineer, water users in a groundwater basin may                             agree to participate in a voluntary arrangement for managing withdrawals at any time, either                             before or after a determination that groundwater withdrawals exceed the groundwater basin s                             safe yield.                                  ii   A voluntary arrangement under Subsection     c  i  shall be consistent with other                             law.                                  iii   The adoption of a voluntary arrangement under this Subsection     c  by less than                             all of the water users in a groundwater basin does not affect the rights of water users who do                             not agree to the voluntary arrangement.                                      To adopt a groundwater management plan, the state engineer shall                                   a   give notice as specified in Subsection     at least    days before the first public                             meeting held in accordance with Subsection     b                                    i   that the state engineer proposes to adopt a groundwater management plan                                   ii   describing generally the land area proposed to be included in the groundwater                             management plan  and                                  iii   stating the location, date, and time of each public meeting to be held in accordance                             with Subsection     b                                    b   hold one or more public meetings in the geographic area proposed to be included                             within the groundwater management plan to                                   i   address the need for a groundwater management plan                                   ii   present any data, studies, or reports that the state engineer intends to consider in                             preparing the groundwater management plan                                   iii   address safe yield and any other subject that may be included in the groundwater                             management plan                                      iv   outline the estimated administrative costs, if any, that groundwater users are likely                             to incur if the plan is adopted  and                                  v   receive any public comments and other information presented at the public                             meeting, including comments from any of the entities listed in Subsection     a  iii                                    c   receive and consider written comments concerning the proposed groundwater                             management plan from any person for a period determined by the state engineer of not less                             than    days after the day on which the notice required by Subsection     a  is given                                   d   i   at least    days prior to final adoption of the groundwater management plan,                             publish notice                                   A   that a draft of the groundwater management plan has been proposed  and                                  B   specifying where a copy of the draft plan may be reviewed  and                                  ii   promptly provide a copy of the draft plan in printed or electronic form to each of                             the entities listed in Subsection     a  iii  that makes written request for a copy  and                                  e   provide notice of the adoption of the groundwater management plan.

B   The district court s treatment of a petition to intervene under this Subsection                                  e  iv  is governed by the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.                                  v   A district court in which an action is brought under Subsection      a  shall                             consolidate all actions brought under that subsection and include in the consolidated action any                             person whose petition to intervene is granted.
