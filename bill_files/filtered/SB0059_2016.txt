Subsections     a  through      f   g  may not be construed to prevent               a   the termination of employment of an individual who, with or without reasonable        accommodation, is physically, mentally, or emotionally unable to perform the duties required        by that individual s employment               b   the variance of insurance premiums or coverage on account of age  or              c   a restriction on the activities of a person licensed in accordance with Title   B,        Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, with respect to an individual who is under    years of age.                  a   It is not a discriminatory or prohibited employment practice               i   for an employer to hire and employ an employee, for an employment agency to        classify or refer for employment an individual, for a labor organization to classify its        membership or to classify or refer for employment an individual, or for an employer, labor        organization, or joint labor management committee controlling an apprenticeship or other        training or retraining program to admit or employ an individual in the program on the basis of        religion, sex, pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy related conditions, age, national origin,        disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity in those certain instances when religion, sex,        pregnancy, childbirth, or pregnancy related conditions, age, if the individual is    years of age        or older, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity is a bona fide        occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular        business or enterprise               ii   for a school, college, university, or other educational institution to hire and employ        an employee of a particular religion if               A   the school, college, university, or other educational institution is, in whole or in        substantial part, owned, supported, controlled, or managed by a particular religious corporation,        association, or society  or              B   the curriculum of the school, college, university, or other educational institution is        directed toward the propagation of a particular religion               iii   for an employer to give preference in employment to               A   the employer s               I   spouse               II   child  or              III   son in law or daughter in law               B   a person for whom the employer is or would be liable to furnish financial support if        the person were unemployed               C   a person to whom the employer during the preceding six months furnishes more        than one half of total financial support regardless of whether or not the employer was or is        legally obligated to furnish support  or              D   a person whose education or training is substantially financed by the employer for        a period of two years or more.              b   Nothing in this chapter applies to a business or enterprise on or near an Indian        reservation with respect to a publicly announced employment practice of the business or        enterprise under which preferential treatment is given to an individual because that individual        is a native American Indian living on or near an Indian reservation.              c   Nothing in this chapter may be interpreted to require an employer, employment        agency, labor organization, vocational school, joint labor management committee, or        apprenticeship program subject to this chapter to grant preferential treatment to an individual or        to a group because of the race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, sexual        orientation, or gender identity of the individual or group on account of an imbalance that may        exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of a race, color, religion, sex,        age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity employed by an employer,        referred or classified for employment by an employment agency or labor organization, admitted        to membership or classified by a labor organization, or admitted to or employed in, any        apprenticeship or other training program, in comparison with the total number or percentage of        persons of that race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or        gender identity in any community or county or in the available work force in any community or        county.                  It is not a discriminatory or prohibited practice with respect to age to observe the        terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employment benefit plan such as a        retirement, pension, or insurance plan that is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this        chapter, except that an employee benefit plan may not excuse the failure to hire an individual.                  Notwithstanding Subsection    , or another statute to the contrary, a person may not        be subject to involuntary termination or retirement from employment on the basis of age alone,        if the individual is    years of age or older, except               a   under Subsection      and              b   when age is a bona fide occupational qualification.                  Nothing in this section prohibits compulsory retirement of an employee who has        attained at least    years of age, and who, for the two year period immediately before        retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or a high policymaking position, if               a   that employee is entitled to an immediate nonforfeitable annual retirement benefit        from the employee s employer s pension, profit sharing, savings, or deferred compensation        plan, or any combination of those plans  and              b   the benefit described in Subsection     a  equals, in the aggregate, at least    ,   .                  a   For purposes of Subsection     g , an employer may require an employee to        provide a certification from the employee s health care provider concerning the medical        advisability of a reasonable accommodation.              b   A certification under Subsection     a  shall include               i   the date the reasonable accommodation becomes medically advisable               ii   the probable duration of the reasonable accommodation  and              iii   an explanatory statement as to the medical advisability of the reasonable        accommodation.              c   Notwithstanding Subsections     g  and     a , an employer may not require an        employee to obtain a certification from the employee s health care provider for more frequent        restroom, food, or water breaks.               d   An employer is not required under Subsection     g  or this Subsection     to        permit an employee to have the employee s child at the workplace for purposes of        accommodating pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related conditions.               e   An employer shall include in an employee handbook, or post in a conspicuous place        in the employer s place of business, written notice concerning an employee s rights to        reasonable accommodations for pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related conditions.
