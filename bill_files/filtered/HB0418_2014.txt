Section        b         is enacted to read                                    b    .  Postadoption visitation for relatives.                                    In accordance with Sections      B            through      B           , after a decree of                             adoption is entered                                 a   a preexisting parent of an adopted child is released from all parental duties and                          responsibilities for the adopted child                                 b   the child of a relative adoptive parent shall be regarded and treated in all respects as                          the child of the relative adoptive parent  and                                c   the relative adoptive parent and the child shall sustain the legal relationship of a                          parent and child and have all the rights and be subject to all the duties of that relationship.                                    In accordance with Section      A  a         , it is the public policy of this state that a                          parent, including a relative adoptive parent, retains the fundamental right and duty to exercise                          primary control over the care, supervision, upbringing, and education of the parent s child.                                    It is also the public policy of this state that a relative of the child may petition for                          visitation, subject to the provisions of this section, when the child has been placed in a relative                          adoption.                                    There is a presumption that the decisions of a fit and competent relative adoptive                          parent, including denying a relative visitation with a child, are in the child s best interest.                                    The court may override the relative adoptive parent s decision regarding visitation                          and grant the relative reasonable rights of visitation if the court finds that the relative has                          rebutted the presumption described in Subsection     by clear and convincing evidence, by                          establishing that                                 a   the relative is a fit and proper person to have visitation with the child                                 b   the relative adoptive parent has denied or unreasonably limited the relative s                          visitation with the child                                 c   the relative has acted as the child s custodian or caregiver, or otherwise has had a                          substantial relationship with the child, and the loss or cessation of that relationship is likely to                          cause harm to the child  and                                d   visitation with the relative is in the best interest of the child.                                    A relative may seek a court order overriding a relative adoptive parent s decision                          regarding visitation with the relative by filing a verified petition, or a petition supported by an                          affidavit, in the juvenile court if a matter is pending, or in the district court in the county in                          which the child                                 a   currently resides  or                                   b   lived with a relative adoptive parent within six months before the commencement                          of the action.                                    A petition under this chapter may be filed in a pending adoption proceeding.                                    The petition shall include detailed facts supporting the relative s right to file the                          petition, including the criteria described in Subsection    .                                    Upon the filing of a petition of a relative or a relative adoptive parent, the court                          may, after a hearing, modify an order regarding relative visitation if                                 a   i   the circumstances of the child, the relative, or the relative adoptive parent have                          materially and substantially changed since the entry of the order to be modified  or                                ii   the order has become unworkable or inappropriate under existing circumstances                            and                                 b   the court determines that a modification is appropriate based upon the criteria                           described in Subsection    .                                      A relative may petition the court to remedy a relative adoptive parent s wrongful                           noncompliance with a visitation order.
