The division shall make rules establishing a point system as provided for in this                             Subsection    .                                    a   i   The division shall assign a number of points to each type of moving traffic violation                             as a measure of its seriousness.                                  ii   The points shall be based upon actual relationships between types of traffic violations                             and motor vehicle traffic accidents.                                  b   Every person convicted of a traffic violation shall have assessed against his driving                             record the number of points that the division has assigned to the type of violation of which the                             person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be decreased by                                 if on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded the severity of violation                             as minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court has graded the severity of                             violation as maximum.                                  c   i   A separate procedure for assessing points for speeding offenses shall be established                             by the division based upon the severity of the offense.                                  ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as                                   A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to ten miles per hour                                   B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from    to    miles per hour                              and                                  C    maximum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by    or more miles per hour.                                  iii   Consideration shall be made for assessment of no points on minimum speeding                             violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.                                  d   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations                             occurring before a time limit set by the division.                                  ii   The time limit may not exceed three years.                                  iii   The division may also delete points to reward violation free driving for periods of                             time set by the division.                                  e   i   By publication in two newspapers having general circulation throughout the state,                             the division shall give notice of the number of points it has assigned to each type of traffic                             violation, the time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level at which                             the division will generally take action to deny or suspend under this section.                                  ii   The division may not change any of the information provided above regarding points                             without first giving new notice in the same manner.                                      a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the                               division shall immediately notify the licensee in a manner specified by the division and afford him                             an opportunity for a hearing in the county where the licensee resides.                                  ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may                             administer oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of                             relevant books and papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.                                  iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision made                             after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made after a                             hearing before the full membership of the division.                                  iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,                             extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.                                  b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications                             determined by the division regarding a person                                   i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination

                          on the highways  or                                  iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to drive a motor vehicle safely.                                      a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state upon                             receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed there                             that, if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a license.                                  b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a                             nonresident driver of a motor vehicle or motorboat of any offense under the motor vehicle laws                            or motorboat laws of this state, forward a certified copy of the record to the motor vehicle                             administrator in the state where the person convicted is a resident.                                      a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a motor                             vehicle or motorboat in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be                             suspended or revoked.                                  b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway  when his  or a motorboat                            on the water when the driver s license has been suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of                             a class C misdemeanor.                                      a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of more                               than one year except                                   i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic or motorboat citation under Subsection                                                                   ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges                             under Section                                                    iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports under                             Subsection                      and                                  iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s

                 satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic or motorboat citation.                                      a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                             Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any person without hearing                             and without receiving a record of his conviction for a crime when the division has reason to                             believe that the person s license was granted by the division through error or fraud or that the                             necessary consent for the license has been withdrawn or is terminated.                                  b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that after                             the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                       a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is incompetent                             or otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon notice in a manner specified by the  division                             of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                                  b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the                             person s license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction imposed                             in accordance with Section                 .                                  c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for                             suspension or revocation of his license.                                       A report authorized by Section                  may not contain any evidence of a conviction                             for speeding on an interstate system in this state if the conviction was for a speed of ten miles per                             hour or less, above the posted speed limit and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in                             a manner specified by the division by the individual whose report is being requested.                                       a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                               Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person if it has reason to                             believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is required under Title                               , Chapter   a, Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility, and has driven the motor vehicle or                             permitted it to be driven within this state without the security being in effect.                                  b  Section          a         regarding the requirement of proof of owner s or operator s security                             applies to persons whose driving privileges are suspended under this Subsection     .                                  c   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this                             Subsection     , the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.                                  d   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been                             revoked by the division under this subsection may file a request for agency action requesting a                             hearing.                                       Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also disqualifies                             any license issued to that person under Part   of this chapter.                                 Section   .    Section                 is amended to read                                           .
