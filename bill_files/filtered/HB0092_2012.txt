The operator of a vessel shall proceed at a safe speed at all times so that the                            operator can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a                            distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances or conditions.                                     a   When the operators of two sailboats are approaching one another so as to                            involve risk of collision, one of the operators shall keep out of the way of the other as follows                                  i   when each has the wind on a different side, the operator of the vessel that has the                            wind on the left side shall keep out of the way of the other                                  ii   when both have the wind on the same side, the operator of the vessel that is to the                            windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel that is to leeward  and                                 iii   if the operator of a vessel with the wind on the left side sees a vessel to windward                            and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the left or on the                               right side, the operator shall keep out of way of the other vessel.                                 b   For purposes of this Subsection    , the windward side shall be the side opposite                            that on which the mainsail is carried.
