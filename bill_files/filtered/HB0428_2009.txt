The director of the division or the director s designee shall make an annual report to                           the Workforce Employment Advisory Council and to the Legislature s Workforce Services and                           Community and Economic Development Interim Committee no later than November    of                               ,     , and     , concerning the impact on individuals applying for unemployment                           compensation and the unemployment trust insurance fund as a result of amendments made to                           Subsections       A             ,       A              c , and       A              d  during the Legislature s                                General Session.                                Section  .    Section      A           is amended to read                                    A      .  Ineligibility for benefits.                                Except as otherwise provided in Subsection    , an individual is ineligible for benefits                               or for purposes of establishing a waiting period                                      a   For the week in which the claimant left work voluntarily without good cause, if                            so found by the division, and for each week thereafter until the claimant has performed services                            in bona fide, covered employment and earned wages for those services equal to at least six                            times the claimant s weekly benefit amount.                                 b   A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits if the claimant leaves work                            under circumstances where it would be contrary to equity and good conscience to impose a                            disqualification.                                 c   Using available information from employers and the claimant, the division shall                            consider for the purposes of this chapter the reasonableness of the claimant s actions, and the                            extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing attachment to the labor market in                            reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a claimant is contrary to equity and                            good conscience.                                 d   i   Notwithstanding any other subsection of this section, for a claimant  who has                           left work voluntarily to accompany, follow, or join the claimant s spouse to or in a new locality                           does so without good cause for purposes of Subsection    .  whose benefit year is effective on                           or after January  ,     , the claimant is not disqualified from benefits for separating from                           employment if the separation is for any compelling family reason.                                 ii   For purposes of Subsection     d  i ,  any compelling family reason  means                                  A   domestic violence that causes the individual to reasonably believe that continued                           employment would jeopardize the safety of the individual or any member of the individual s                           immediate family                                  B   the illness or disability of a member of the individual s immediate family  or                                 C   the need for the individual to accompany the individual s spouse                                  I   due to a change in location of the spouse s employment  and                                 II   to a place from which it is impractical for the individual to commute.                                     a   For the week in which the claimant was discharged for just cause or for an act or                            omission in connection with employment, not constituting a crime, which is deliberate, willful,                            or wanton and adverse to the employer s rightful interest, if so found by the division, and                            thereafter until the claimant has earned an amount equal to at least six times the claimant s                            weekly benefit amount in bona fide covered employment.                                    b   For the week in which the claimant was discharged for dishonesty constituting a                            crime or any felony or class A misdemeanor in connection with the claimant s work as shown                            by the facts, together with the claimant s admission, or as shown by the claimant s conviction of                            that crime in a court of competent jurisdiction and for the    next following weeks.                                 c   Wage credits shall be deleted from the claimant s base period, and are not available                            for this or any subsequent claim for benefits.                                     a   i   If the division finds that the claimant has failed without good cause to                            properly apply for available suitable work, to accept a referral to suitable work offered by the                            employment office, or to accept suitable work offered by an employer or the employment                            office.                                 ii   The ineligibility continues until the claimant has performed services in bona fide                            covered employment and earned wages for the services in an amount equal to at least six times                            the claimant s weekly benefit amount.                                 b   i   A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits for failure to apply, accept                            referral, or accept available suitable work under circumstances where it would be contrary to                            equity and good conscience to impose a disqualification.                                 ii   The division shall consider the purposes of this chapter, the reasonableness of the                            claimant s actions, and the extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing                            attachment to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a                            claimant is contrary to equity and good conscience.                                 c   In determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the division shall                            consider the                                  i   degree of risk involved to his health, safety, and morals                                  ii   individual s physical fitness and prior training                                  iii   individual s prior earnings and experience                                  iv   individual s length of unemployment                                  v   prospects for securing local work in his customary occupation                                  vi   wages for similar work in the locality  and                                 vii   distance of the available work from his residence.                                 d   Prior earnings shall be considered on the basis of all four quarters used in                            establishing eligibility and not just the earnings from the most recent employer.  The division                               shall be more prone to find work as suitable the longer the claimant has been unemployed and                            the less likely the prospects are to secure local work in his customary occupation.                                 e   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work is suitable, and                            benefits may not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing                            to accept new work under any of the following conditions                                  i   if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor                            dispute                                  ii   if the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less                            favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality  or                                 iii   if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a                            company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.                                     For any week in which the division finds that the claimant s unemployment is due                            to a stoppage of work that exists because of a strike involving the claimant s grade, class, or                            group of workers at the factory or establishment at which the claimant is or was last employed.                                 a   If the division finds that a strike has been fomented by a worker of any employer,                            none of the workers of the grade, class, or group of workers of the individual who is found to                            be a party to the plan, or agreement to foment a strike, shall be eligible for benefits.  However,                            if the division finds that the strike is caused by the failure or refusal of any employer to                            conform to any law of the state or of the United States pertaining to hours, wages, or other                            conditions of work, the strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.                                 b   If the division finds that the employer, the employer s agent or representative has                            conspired, planned, or agreed with any of the employer s workers, their agents or                            representatives to foment a strike, that strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.                                 c   A worker may receive benefits if, subsequent to the worker s unemployment                            because of a strike as defined in this Subsection    , the worker has obtained employment and                            has been paid wages of not less than the amount specified in Subsection       A              and has                            worked as specified in Subsection        A              f .
