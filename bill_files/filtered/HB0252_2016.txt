Section          is amended to read                     . Mental illness    Use as a defense    Influence of alcohol or other       substance voluntarily consumed    Definition.                 a   It is a defense to a prosecution under any statute or ordinance that the defendant,       as a result of mental illness, lacked the mental state required as an element of the offense       charged.             b   Mental illness is not otherwise a defense, but may be evidence in mitigation of the       penalty in a capital felony under Section          and may be evidence of special mitigation       reducing the level of a criminal homicide or attempted criminal homicide offense under       Section         . .                 The defense defined in this section includes the defenses known as  insanity  and        diminished mental capacity.                  A person who asserts a defense of insanity or diminished mental capacity, and who       is under the influence of voluntarily consumed, injected, or ingested alcohol, controlled       substances, or volatile substances at the time of the alleged offense is not excused from       criminal responsibility on the basis of mental illness if the alcohol or substance caused,       triggered, or substantially contributed to the mental illness.                 As used in this section              a    Intellectual disability  means a significant subaverage general intellectual       functioning, existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior, and manifested prior to       age   .                  a    b   i    Mental illness  means a mental disease or defect that substantially       impairs a person s mental, emotional, or behavioral functioning.  A mental defect may be a       congenital condition, the result of injury, or a residual effect of a physical or mental disease and       includes, but is not limited to,  mental retardation  intellectual disability.              b    ii    Mental illness  does not mean  an abnormality manifested primarily by       repeated criminal conduct.                   Mental retardation   means a significant subaverage general intellectual       functioning, existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior, and manifested prior to       age   .             Section  .  Section         is amended to read                    . Order for hearing    Stay of other proceedings    Examinations of       defendant    Scope of examination and report.                 a   When a petition is filed pursuant to Section         raising the issue of the       defendant s competency to stand trial or when the court raises the issue of the defendant s       competency pursuant to Section        , the court in which proceedings are pending shall stay       all proceedings.  If the proceedings are in a court other than the district court in which the       petition is filed, the district court shall notify that court of the filing of the petition.             b   The district court in which the petition is filed              i   shall review the allegations of incompetency              ii   may hold a limited hearing solely for the purpose of determining the sufficiency of       the petition if the court finds the petition is not clearly sufficient on its face              iii   shall hold a hearing if the petition is opposed by either party              iv   may not order an examination of the defendant or order a hearing on the mental       condition of the defendant unless the court finds that the allegations in the petition raise a bona       fide doubt as to the defendant s competency to stand trial  and             v   shall order an examination of the defendant and a hearing on the defendant s mental       condition if the court finds that the allegations raise a bona fide doubt as to the defendant s       competency to stand trial.                 a   After the granting of a petition and prior to a full competency hearing, the court       may order the Department of Human Services to examine the person and to report to the court       concerning the defendant s mental condition.             b   The defendant shall be examined by at least two mental health experts not involved       in the current treatment of the defendant.             c   If the issue is sufficiently raised in the petition or if it becomes apparent that the       defendant may be incompetent due to  mental retardation  intellectual disability, at least one       expert experienced in  mental retardation  intellectual disability assessment shall evaluate the       defendant.  Upon appointment of the experts, the petitioner or other party as directed by the       court shall provide information and materials to the examiners relevant to a determination of       the defendant s competency and shall provide copies of the charging document, arrest or       incident reports pertaining to the charged offense, known criminal history information, and       known prior mental health evaluations and treatments.             d   The prosecuting and defense attorneys shall cooperate in providing the relevant       information and materials to the examiners, and the court may make the necessary orders to       provide the information listed in Subsection     c  to the examiners.  The court may provide in       its order for a competency examination of a defendant that custodians of mental health records       pertaining to the defendant shall provide those records to the examiners without the need for       consent of the defendant or further order of the court.                 During the examination under Subsection    , unless the court or the executive       director of the department directs otherwise, the defendant shall be retained in the same       custody or status he was in at the time the examination was ordered.                 The experts shall in the conduct of their examination and in their report to the court        consider and address, in addition to any other factors determined to be relevant by the experts               a   the defendant s present capacity to               i   comprehend and appreciate the charges or allegations against the defendant               ii   disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind               iii   comprehend and appreciate the range and nature of possible penalties, if        applicable, that may be imposed in the proceedings against the defendant               iv   engage in reasoned choice of legal strategies and options               v   understand the adversary nature of the proceedings against the defendant               vi   manifest appropriate courtroom behavior  and              vii   testify relevantly, if applicable               b   the impact of the mental disorder ,  or  mental retardation  intellectual disability, if        any, on the nature and quality of the defendant s relationship with counsel               c   if psychoactive medication is currently being administered               i   whether the medication is necessary to maintain the defendant s competency  and              ii   the effect of the medication, if any, on the defendant s demeanor and affect and        ability to participate in the proceedings  and              d   whether the defendant is exhibiting false or exaggerated physical or psychological        symptoms relevant to the defendant s capacity to stand trial.                  If the expert s opinion is that the defendant is incompetent to proceed, the expert        shall indicate in the report               a   which of the above factors contributes to the defendant s incompetency               b   the nature of the defendant s mental disorder or  mental retardation  intellectual        disability and its relationship to the factors contributing to the defendant s incompetency               c   the treatment or treatments appropriate and available               d   the defendant s capacity to give informed consent to treatment to restore        competency  and              e   any diagnostic instruments, methods, and observations used by the expert to        determine whether or not the defendant is exhibiting false or exaggerated physical or        psychological symptoms relevant to the defendant s capacity to stand trial and the expert s        opinion as to the significance of any false or exaggerated symptoms regarding the defendant s        capacity.                  The experts examining the defendant shall provide an initial report to the court and        the prosecuting and defense attorneys within    days of the receipt of the court s order.  The        report shall inform the court of the examiner s opinion concerning the competency of the        defendant to stand trial, or, in the alternative, the examiner may inform the court in writing that        additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the examiner informs the court that        additional time is needed, the examiner shall have up to an additional    days to provide the        report to the court and counsel.  The examiner shall provide the report within    days from the        receipt of the court s order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional        period of time to complete the examination and provide the report.                  Any written report submitted by the experts shall               a   identify the specific matters referred for evaluation               b   describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination and the        purpose or purposes for each               c   state the expert s clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue referred        for examination by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the expert        could not give an opinion  and              d   identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the basis for the        expert s clinical findings and opinions.                  a   Any statement made by the defendant in the course of any competency        examination, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, any        testimony by the expert based upon the statement, and any other fruits of the statement may not        be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an issue        respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.  The evidence        may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the defendant s competency.              b   Prior to examining the defendant, examiners should specifically advise the        defendant of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection     a .                  a   When the report is received the court shall set a date for a mental hearing.  The        hearing shall be held in not less than five and not more than    days, unless the court enlarges        the time for good cause.              b   Any person or organization directed by the department to conduct the examination        may be subpoenaed to testify at the hearing.  If the experts are in conflict as to the competency        of the defendant, all experts should be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably available.  A        conflict in the opinions of the experts does not require the appointment of an additional expert        unless the court determines the appointment to be necessary.              c   The court may call any examiner to testify at the hearing who is not called by the        parties.  If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross examine the expert.                   a   A person shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of        the evidence, finds the person incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the        proponent of incompetency at the hearing.              b   An adjudication of incompetency to proceed does not operate as an adjudication of        incompetency to give informed consent for medical treatment or for any other purpose, unless        specifically set forth in the court order.                   In determining the defendant s competency to stand trial, the court shall consider        the totality of the circumstances, which may include the testimony of lay witnesses, in addition        to the expert testimony, studies, and reports provided under this section.                   a   If the court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, its order shall        contain findings addressing each of the factors in Subsections     a  and  b .  The order issued        pursuant to Subsection            which the court sends to the facility where the defendant is        committed or to the person who is responsible for assessing the defendant s progress toward        competency shall be provided contemporaneously with the transportation and commitment        order of the defendant, unless exigent circumstances require earlier commitment in which case        the court shall forward the order within five working days of the order of transportation and        commitment of the defendant.              b   The order finding the defendant incompetent to stand trial shall be accompanied by               i   copies of the reports of the experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of        examination if not provided previously               ii   copies of any of the psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports submitted to        the court relative to the mental condition of the defendant  and              iii   any other documents made available to the court by either the defense or the        prosecution, pertaining to the defendant s current or past mental condition.                   a   If the court finds it necessary to order the defendant transported prior to the        completion of findings and compilation of documents required under Subsection     , the        transportation and commitment order delivering the defendant to the Utah State Hospital, or        other mental health facility as directed by the executive director of the Department of Human        Services or a designee, shall indicate that the defendant s commitment is based upon a finding        of incompetency, and the mental health facility s copy of the order shall be accompanied by the        reports of any experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of examination.              b   The executive director of the Department of Human Services or a designee may        refuse to accept a defendant as a patient unless the defendant is accompanied by a        transportation and commitment order which is accompanied by the reports.                   Upon a finding of incompetency to stand trial by the court, the prosecuting and        defense attorneys shall provide information and materials relevant to the defendant s        competency to the facility where the defendant is committed or to the person responsible for        assessing the defendant s progress towards competency.  In addition to any other materials, the        prosecuting attorney shall provide               a   copies of the charging document and supporting affidavits or other documents used        in the determination of probable cause               b   arrest or incident reports prepared by a law enforcement agency pertaining to the        charged offense  and              c   information concerning the defendant s known criminal history.                   The court may make any reasonable order to insure compliance with this section.                   Failure to comply with this section does not result in the dismissal of criminal        charges.             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    . Intellectually disabled defendant not subject to death penalty           Defendant with subaverage functioning not subject to death penalty if confession not        corroborated.                  A defendant who is found by the court to be  mentally retarded  intellectually        disabled as defined in Section      a     is not subject to the death penalty.                  A defendant who does not meet the definition of  mental retardation  intellectually        disabled under Section      a     is not subject to the death penalty if               a   the defendant has significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that        exists concurrently with significant deficiencies in adaptive functioning               b   the functioning described in Subsection     a  is manifested prior to age     and              c   the state intends to introduce into evidence a confession by the defendant which is        not supported by substantial evidence independent of the confession.             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    .  Intellectually disabled  defined.             As used in this chapter, a defendant is   mentally retarded  intellectually disabled  if                   the defendant has significant subaverage general intellectual functioning that results        in and exists concurrently with significant deficiencies in adaptive functioning that exist        primarily in the areas of reasoning or impulse control, or in both of these areas  and                  the subaverage general intellectual functioning and the significant deficiencies in        adaptive functioning under Subsection     are both manifested prior to age   .             Section  .  Section      a     is amended to read                   a    . Court may raise issue of intellectual disability at any time.             The court in which a capital charge is pending may raise the issue of the defendant s         mental retardation  intellectual disability at any time.  If raised by the court, counsel for each        party shall be allowed to address the issue of  mental retardation  intellectual disability.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
