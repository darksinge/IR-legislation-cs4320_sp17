The division shall make rules establishing a point system as provided for in this                      Subsection    .                           a   i   The division shall assign a number of points to each type of moving traffic violation                               as a measure of its seriousness.                           ii   The points shall be based upon actual relationships between types of traffic violations                      and motor vehicle traffic accidents.                           b   Every person convicted of a traffic violation shall have assessed against his driving                      record the number of points that the division has assigned to the type of violation of which the                      person has been convicted, except that the number of points assessed shall be decreased by     if                      on the abstract of the court record of the conviction the court has graded the severity of violation as                      minimum, and shall be increased by     if on the abstract the court has graded the severity of                      violation as maximum.                           c   i   A separate procedure for assessing points for speeding offenses shall be established                      by the division based upon the severity of the offense.                           ii   The severity of a speeding violation shall be graded as                            A    minimum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by up to ten miles per hour                            B    intermediate  for exceeding the posted speed limit by from    to    miles per hour  and                           C    maximum  for exceeding the posted speed limit by    or more miles per hour.                           iii   Consideration shall be made for assessment of no points on minimum speeding                      violations, except for speeding violations in school zones.                           d   i   Points assessed against a person s driving record shall be deleted for violations                      occurring before a time limit set by the division.                           ii   The time limit may not exceed three years.                           iii   The division may also delete points to reward violation free driving for periods of time                      set by the division.                           e   i   By publication in two newspapers having general circulation throughout the state, the                      division shall give notice of the number of points it has assigned to each type of traffic violation, the                      time limit set by the division for the deletion of points, and the point level at which the division will                      generally take action to deny or suspend under this section.                           ii   The division may not change any of the information provided above regarding points                      without first giving new notice in the same manner.                                        a   i   Upon denying or suspending the license of a person under this section, the division                      shall immediately notify the licensee in  writing  a manner specified by the division and afford him                      an opportunity for a hearing in the county where the licensee resides.                           ii   The hearing shall be documented, and the division or its authorized agent may administer                      oaths, may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books and                      papers, and may require a reexamination of the licensee.                           iii   One or more members of the division may conduct the hearing, and any decision made                      after a hearing before any number of the members of the division is as valid as if made after a                      hearing before the full membership of the division.                           iv   After the hearing the division shall either rescind its order of denial or suspension,                      extend the denial or suspension of the license, or revoke the license.                           b   The denial or suspension of the license remains in effect pending qualifications                      determined by the division regarding a person                            i   whose license has been denied or suspended following reexamination                            ii   who is incompetent to drive a motor vehicle                            iii   who is afflicted with mental or physical infirmities that might make him dangerous on                      the highways  or                           iv   who may not have the necessary knowledge or skill to drive a motor vehicle safely.                               a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any resident of this state upon                      receiving notice of the conviction of that person in another state of an offense committed there that,                      if committed in this state, would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of a license.                           b   The division may, upon receiving a record of the conviction in this state of a nonresident                      driver of a motor vehicle of any offense under the motor vehicle laws of this state, forward a certified                      copy of the record to the motor vehicle administrator in the state where the person convicted is a                      resident.                               a   The division may suspend or revoke the license of any nonresident to drive a motor                      vehicle in this state for any cause for which the license of a resident driver may be suspended or                      revoked.                                    b   Any nonresident who drives a motor vehicle upon a highway when his license has been                      suspended or revoked by the division is guilty of a class C misdemeanor.                               a   The division may not deny or suspend the license of any person for a period of more                      than one year except                            i   for failure to comply with the terms of a traffic citation under Subsection                                ii   upon receipt of a second or subsequent order suspending juvenile driving privileges                      under Section                                             iii   when extending a denial or suspension upon receiving certain records or reports under                      Subsection                      and                           iv   for failure to give and maintain owner s or operator s security under Section          a        .                           b   The division may suspend the license of a person under Subsection     until he shows                      satisfactory evidence of compliance with the terms of the traffic citation.                               a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                      Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of any person without hearing and                      without receiving a record of his conviction for a crime when the division has reason to believe that                      the person s license was granted by the division through error or fraud or that the necessary consent                      for the license has been withdrawn or is terminated.                           b   The procedure upon suspension is the same as under Subsection    , except that after the                      hearing the division shall either rescind its order of suspension or cancel the license.                                a   The division, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver is incompetent or                      otherwise not qualified to be licensed, may upon  written  notice in a manner specified by the                      division of at least five days to the licensee require him to submit to an examination.                           b   Upon the conclusion of the examination the division may suspend or revoke the person s                      license, permit him to retain the license, or grant a license subject to a restriction imposed in                      accordance with Section                 .                           c   Refusal or neglect of the licensee to submit to an examination is grounds for suspension                      or revocation of his license.                                A report authorized by Section                  may not contain any evidence of a conviction                               for speeding on an interstate system in this state if the conviction was for a speed of ten miles per                      hour or less, above the posted speed limit and did not result in an accident, unless authorized in                       writing  a manner specified by the division by the individual whose report is being requested.                                a   By following the emergency procedures in Title   , Chapter   b, Administrative                      Procedures Act, the division may immediately suspend the license of a person if it has reason to                      believe that the person is the owner of a motor vehicle for which security is required under Title   ,                      Chapter   a, Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility, and has driven the motor vehicle or permitted                      it to be driven within this state without the security being in effect.                           b  Section          a         regarding the requirement of proof of owner s or operator s security                      applies to persons whose driving privileges are suspended under this Subsection     .                           c   If the division exercises the right of immediate suspension granted under this Subsection                         , the notice and hearing provisions of Subsection     apply.                           d   A person whose license suspension has been sustained or whose license has been revoked                      by the division under this subsection may file a request for agency action requesting a hearing.                                Any suspension or revocation of a person s license under this section also disqualifies                      any license issued to that person under Part   of this chapter.                          Section   .    Section                 is amended to read                                    .
