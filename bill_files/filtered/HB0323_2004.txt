Legislative Review Note      as of                PM     This bill regulates software that creates advertisements on a computer as a result of visiting  certain Internet websites, and that collects information regarding the computer s Internet use.  Case law surrounding regulation of Internet activities is evolving. State regulations of Internet  activities have been challenged for violating principles such as the Commerce Clause of the  United States Constitution. Some courts have indicated that the need for national uniformity  limits a state s ability to regulate Internet activities. Under other court rulings, however, this bill  could be upheld if a court determined that the benefits this bill provides to Utahans outweigh  the burden the bill places on interstate commerce.
