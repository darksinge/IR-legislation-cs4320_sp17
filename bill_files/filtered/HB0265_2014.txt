A temporary guardian may be removed at any time, and shall obey such                           orders and make such reports as the court requires.                                      If, after notice and hearing, the court finds good cause, the court may appoint a                           temporary guardian until further order of the court.                                     Unless the allegedly incapacitated person has already obtained counsel in this                           proceeding or an attorney has been already appointed for the person, the court may appoint an                           attorney to represent the person in the proceeding.                                        Until the full hearing and order of the court, the temporary guardian shall be                           charged with the care and custody of the ward and may not permit the ward to be removed                           from the state.  The authority of any permanent guardian previously appointed by the court is                           suspended so long as a temporary guardian has authority.  A temporary guardian may be                           removed at any time, and shall obey such orders and make such reports as the court requires.                                     A temporary guardian has all of the powers and duties of a permanent guardian as                           set forth in Section                 .                                Section  .

Absent a specific limitation on the guardian s power in the order of appointment,                            the guardian has the same powers, rights, and duties respecting the ward that a parent has                            respecting the parent s unemancipated minor child except that a guardian is not liable to third                            persons for acts of the ward solely by reason of the parental relationship.  In particular, and                            without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian has the following powers and duties, except as                            modified by order of the court                                  a   To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of                            competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, the guardian is entitled                            to custody of the person of the ward and may establish the ward s place of abode within or                            without this state.                                 b   If entitled to custody of the ward the guardian shall provide for the care, comfort,                            and maintenance of the ward and, whenever appropriate, arrange for the ward s training and                            education.  Without regard to custodial rights of the ward s person, the guardian shall take                            reasonable care of the ward s clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other personal effects and                            commence protective proceedings if other property of the ward is in need of protection.                                 c   A guardian may give any consents or approvals that may be necessary to enable the                            ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service.                                 d   If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been appointed, the guardian may                                  i   institute proceedings to compel any person under a duty to support the ward or to                            pay sums for the welfare of the ward to perform that duty   or                                     ii   compel the production of the ward s estate documents, including the ward s will,                           trust, power of attorney, and any advance health care directive  and                                  ii    iii   receive money and tangible property deliverable to the ward and apply the                            money and property for support, care, and education of the ward  but the guardian may not use                            funds from the ward s estate for room and board which the guardian, the guardian s spouse,                            parent, or child have furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order of                            the court made upon notice to at least one adult relative in the nearest degree of kinship to the                            ward in which there is an adult.

If a fee is paid for an accounting of an estate, no fee shall be charged for an                            accounting of the status of a person.                                 viii   If a guardian                                  A   makes a substantial misstatement on filings of annual reports                                  B   is guilty of gross impropriety in handling the property of the ward  or                                 C   willfully fails to file the report required by this subsection, after receiving written                            notice from the court of the failure to file and after a grace period of two months has elapsed,                            the court may impose a penalty in an amount not to exceed   ,   .  The court may also order                            restitution of funds misappropriated from the estate of a ward.  The penalty shall be paid by the                            guardian and may not be paid by the estate.                                 ix   These provisions and penalties governing annual reports do not apply if the                            guardian is the parent of the ward.                                 x   For the purposes of Subsections     e  i ,  ii ,  iii , and  iv ,  interested persons                             means those persons required to receive notice in guardianship proceedings as set forth in                            Section                 .                                 f   If a conservator has been appointed, all of the ward s estate received by the guardian                            in excess of those funds expended to meet current expenses for support, care, and education of                            the ward shall be paid to the conservator for management as provided in this code  and the                            guardian shall account to the conservator for funds expended.

A conservator so appointed succeeds                            to the title and powers of the preceding conservator.                                     Before removing a conservator, accepting the resignation of a conservator, or                            ordering that a protected person s incapacity has terminated, the court shall follow the same                            procedures to safeguard the rights of the protected person as apply to a petition for appointment                            of a conservator as provided in Section                 .
