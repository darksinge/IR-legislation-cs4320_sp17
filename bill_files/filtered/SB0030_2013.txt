          be considered to be an adjudication by the state engineer of the validity of the claimed water                            right.                                     a   The state engineer shall                                  i   conduct a field investigation of each claim filed  and                                 ii   prepare a report of the investigation.

                     in a claim submitted pursuant to this section may file an action in district court to determine the                            validity of the claim, whether or not the claim has been accepted for filing by the state                            engineer.                                 b   Venue for the action shall be in the county in which the point of diversion listed in                            the claim is located, or in a county where the place of use, or some part of it, is located.                                 c   The action shall be brought against the claimant

water under                               this section, the claimant shall have the initial burden of proof as to the validity of the claimed                            right.                                 e   Any person filing an action challenging the validity of a claim to the use of water                            under this section shall notify the state engineer of the pendency of the action in a manner                            prescribed by the state engineer.  Upon receipt of the notice, the state engineer may take no                            action on any change or exchange applications founded on the claim that is the subject of the                            pending litigation, until the court adjudicates the matter.                                 f   Upon the entering of any final order or decree in any judicial action to determine the                            validity of a claim under this section, the prevailing party shall file a certified copy of the order                            or decree with the state engineer, which shall become part of the state engineer s file on the                            claim.                                      The state engineer may make rules consistent with this section specifying                           information required to be included in a claim and claim procedures.
