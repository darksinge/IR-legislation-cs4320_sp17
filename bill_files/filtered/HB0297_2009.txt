If the court imposes the use of an ignition interlock system as a condition of                             probation, the court shall                                   a   stipulate on the record the requirement for and the period of the use of an ignition                                interlock system                                   b   order that an ignition interlock system be installed on each motor vehicle owned or                             operated by the probationer, at the probationer s expense                                   c   immediately notify the Driver License Division and the person s probation provider                             of the order  and                                  d   require the probationer to provide proof of compliance with the court s order to the                             probation provider within    days of the order.                                      a   The probationer shall provide timely proof of installation within    days of an

failure to comply means any reason the court finds sufficiently justifiable                             to excuse the probationer s failure to comply with the court s order.                                      a   Any probationer required to install an ignition interlock system shall have the                             system monitored by the manufacturer or dealer of the system for proper use and accuracy at                             least semiannually and more frequently as the court may order.                                  b   i   A report of the monitoring shall be issued by the manufacturer or dealer to the                             court or the person s probation provider.                                  ii   The report shall be issued within    days following each monitoring.                                      a   If an ignition interlock system is ordered installed, the probationer shall pay the                             reasonable costs of leasing or buying and installing and maintaining the system.                                  b   A probationer may not be excluded from this section for inability to pay the costs,                             unless                                   i   the probationer files an affidavit of impecuniosity  and                                  ii   the court enters a finding that the probationer is impecunious.                                  c   In lieu of waiver of the entire amount of the cost, the court may direct the                                probationer to make partial or installment payments of costs when appropriate.                                  d   The ignition interlock provider shall cover the costs of waivers by the court under                             this Subsection    .                                      a   If a probationer is required in the course and scope of employment to operate a                             motor vehicle owned by the probationer s employer, the probationer may operate that motor                             vehicle without installation of an ignition interlock system only if                                   i   the motor vehicle is used in the course and scope of employment                                   ii   the employer has been notified that the employee is restricted  and                                  iii   the employee has proof of the notification in the employee s possession while                             operating the employer s motor vehicle.                                  b   i   To the extent that an employer owned motor vehicle is made available to a                             probationer subject to this section for personal use, no exemption under this section shall apply.                                  ii   A probationer intending to operate an employer owned motor vehicle for personal                             use and who is restricted to the operation of a motor vehicle equipped with an ignition interlock                             system shall notify the employer and obtain consent in writing from the employer to install a                             system in the employer owned motor vehicle.                                  c   A motor vehicle owned by a business entity that is all or partly owned or controlled                             by a probationer subject to this section is not a motor vehicle owned by the employer and does                             not qualify for an exemption under this Subsection    .                                      a   In accordance with Title   G, Chapter  , Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act,                             the commissioner shall make rules setting standards for the certification of ignition

the safe operation of the motor vehicle                                   ii   have features that make circumventing difficult and that do not interfere with the                             normal use

of motor vehicle environments  and                                  viii   be manufactured by a party who will provide liability insurance.                                  c   The commissioner may adopt in whole or in part, the guidelines, rules, studies, or                             independent laboratory tests relied upon in certification of ignition interlock systems by other                             states.                                  d   A list of certified systems shall be published by the commissioner and the cost of                             certification shall be borne by the manufacturers or dealers of ignition interlock systems                             seeking to sell, offer for sale, or lease the systems.                                  e   i   In accordance with Section       J                J         , the commissioner may                             establish an annual dollar assessment against the manufacturers of ignition interlock systems                             distributed in the state for the costs incurred in certifying.                                  ii   The assessment under Subsection     e  i  shall be apportioned among the

of Finance shall transfer only those funds necessary to                              ensure that the balance in the account equals    of the Education Fund appropriations for the
