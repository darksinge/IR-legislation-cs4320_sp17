COHABITANT ABUSE ACT AMENDMENTS                 GENERAL SESSION          STATE OF UTAH           Sponsor  Patricia B. Larson          AN ACT RELATING TO THE COHABITANT ABUSE ACT  CHANGING THE TERM          PRIMARY  AGGRESSOR TO  PREDOMINANT  AGGRESSOR.         This act affects sections of Utah Code Annotated      as follows          AMENDS                      . , as enacted by Chapter    , Laws of Utah               Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah               Section  .  Section         .  is amended to read                       . .  Powers and duties of law enforcement officers to arrest.                     The primary duty of  law enforcement officers responding to a domestic violence call          is to protect the victim and enforce the law.                   a   In addition to the arrest powers described in Section       , when a peace officer          responds to a domestic violence call and has probable cause to believe that an act of domestic          violence has been committed, the peace officer shall arrest without a warrant or issue a citation to          any person that he has probable cause to believe has committed an act of domestic violence.               b   If the peace officer has probable cause to believe that there will be continued violence          against the alleged victim, or if there is evidence that the perpetrator has either recently caused          serious bodily injury or used a dangerous weapon in the domestic violence offense, the officer          shall arrest and take the alleged perpetrator into custody, and may not utilize the option of issuing          a citation under this section.  For purposes of this section  serious bodily injury  and  dangerous          weapon  mean the same as those terms are defined in Section         .               c   If a peace officer does not immediately exercise arrest powers or initiate criminal          proceedings by citation or otherwise, he shall notify the victim of his or her right to initiate a          criminal proceeding and of the importance of preserving evidence, in accordance with the           requirements of Section        . .                  If a law enforcement officer receives complaints of domestic violence from two or         more opposing persons, the officer shall evaluate each complaint separately to determine who the          primary  predominant aggressor was.  If the officer determines that one person was the  primary          predominant physical aggressor, the officer need not arrest the other person alleged to have         committed domestic violence.  In determining who the  primary  predominant aggressor  was, the         officer shall consider               a   any prior complaints of domestic violence               b   the relative severity of injuries inflicted on each person                c   the likelihood of  future injury to each of the parties  and               d   whether one of the parties acted in self defense.                     A law enforcement officer  may not threaten, suggest, or otherwise indicate the          possible arrest of all parties in order to discourage any party s request for intervention by law          enforcement.                   a   A law enforcement officer who does not make an arrest after investigating a          complaint of domestic violence, or who arrests two or more parties, shall submit a detailed, written          report specifying the grounds for not arresting or for arresting both parties.               b   A law enforcement officer who does not make an arrest shall notify the victim of his          or her right to initiate a criminal proceeding and of the importance of preserving evidence.                   a   A law enforcement officer responding to a complaint of domestic violence shall          prepare an incident report that includes the officer s disposition of the case.               b   That report shall be made available to the victim, upon request, at no cost.               c   The law enforcement agency shall forward a copy of the incident report to the          appropriate prosecuting attorney within five days after the complaint of domestic violence          occurred.                   Each law enforcement agency shall, as soon as practicable, make a written record and          maintain records of all incidents of domestic violence reported to it, and shall be identified by a          law enforcement agency code for domestic violence.
