When a decree of divorce is rendered, the court may include in it equitable orders           relating to the children, property, debts or obligations, and parties.  The court shall include the         following in every decree of divorce               a   an order assigning responsibility for the payment of reasonable and necessary medical         and dental expenses of the dependent children               b   if coverage is or becomes available at a reasonable cost, an order requiring the purchase         and maintenance of appropriate health, hospital, and dental care insurance for the dependent         children               c   pursuant to Section       .                i   an order specifying which party is responsible for the payment of joint debts,          obligations, or liabilities of the parties contracted or incurred during marriage                ii   an order requiring the parties to notify respective creditors or obligees, regarding the          court s division of debts, obligations, or liabilities and regarding the parties  separate, current          addresses  and               iii   provisions for the enforcement of these orders  and               d   provisions for income withholding in accordance with Title   A, Chapter   , Recovery          Services.                   The court may include, in an order determining child support, an order assigning          financial responsibility for all or a portion of child care expenses incurred on behalf of the          dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.  If the court          determines that the circumstances are appropriate and that the dependent children would be          adequately cared for, it may include an order allowing the noncustodial parent to provide child care          for the dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.                   The court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for          the custody of the children and their support, maintenance, health, and dental care, and for          distribution of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary.                   a   In determining visitation rights of parents ,  or grandparents,  and other members          of the immediate family,  the court shall consider the best interest of the child.               b   Upon a specific finding by the court of the need for peace officer enforcement, the          court may include in an order establishing a visitation schedule a provision, among other things,          authorizing any peace officer to enforce a court ordered visitation schedule entered under this          chapter.                          If a petition for modification of child custody or visitation provisions of a court order         is made and denied, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the reasonable attorneys  fees         expended by the prevailing party in that action, if the court determines that the petition was         without merit and not asserted or defended against in good faith.                  If a petition alleges substantial or chronic noncompliance with a visitation order by a         parent , a  or grandparent , or other member of the immediate family  pursuant to Section                 .  where a visitation right has been previously granted by the court, the court may award         to the prevailing party costs, including  actual  attorney fees and court costs incurred by the         prevailing party because of the other party s failure to provide or exercise court ordered visitation.                   a   The court shall consider at least the following factors in determining alimony                i   the financial condition and needs of the recipient spouse                ii   the recipient s earning capacity or ability to produce income                iii   the ability of the payor spouse to provide support  and               iv   the length of the marriage.               b   The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining alimony.               c   As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at the time          of separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection     a .  However, the court          shall consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion, base alimony          on the standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short duration, when no          children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider the standard of          living that existed at the time of the marriage.               d   The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the parties           respective standards of living.               e   When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major change in the          income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change shall be considered          in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony.  If one spouse s earning          capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses during the marriage, the          court may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital property and awarding          alimony.               f   In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no children          have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring each party to                 the condition which existed at the time of the marriage.              g   i   The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new orders         regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not foreseeable at the         time of the divorce.              ii   The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address needs         of the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court finds         extenuating circumstances that justify that action.              iii   In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not         be considered, except as provided in this subsection.               A   The court may consider the subsequent spouse s financial ability to share living          expenses.               B   The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that the          payor s improper conduct justifies that consideration.               h   Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years that the          marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony, the court finds extenuating          circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.                   Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court that          a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage of that          former spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void ab initio, payment of          alimony shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the action of annulment and          his rights are determined.                   Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates upon          establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with another          person.              Section  .  Section          is amended to read                       .  Custody of children in case of separation or divorce    Custody           consideration.                   If a husband and wife having minor children are separated, or their marriage is declared          void or dissolved, the court shall make an order for the future care and custody of the minor          children as it considers appropriate.  In determining custody, the court shall consider the best          interests of the child and the past conduct and demonstrated moral standards of each of the parties.                  The court may inquire of the children and take into consideration the children s desires regarding         the future custody, but the expressed desires are not controlling and the court may determine the         children s custody otherwise.                  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds         relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing the         child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds appropriate.                  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, or has attempted         to permanently relinquish custody to a third party, it shall take that evidence into consideration in         determining whether to award custody to the other parent.                   a   A court may not discriminate against a parent due to a disability, as defined in          Section        , in awarding custody or determining whether a substantial change has occurred          for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.               b   If a court takes a parent s disability into account in awarding custody or determining          whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody, the          parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference arising therefrom by          showing that                i   the disability does not significantly or substantially inhibit the parent s ability to provide          for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue  or               ii   the parent with a disability has sufficient human, monetary, or other resources available          to supplement the parent s ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at          issue.               c   Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to                i   abuse, neglect, or dependency proceedings under Title   A, Chapter  a, Child and          Family Services, or Title   , Chapter  a, Juvenile Courts  or               ii   adoption proceedings under Title   , Chapter   , Adoption.                   The court shall enter findings as to the underlying reasons for its award of custody.              Section  .  Section       a   is amended to read                     a  .

The education course is designed to educate parents or         grandparents of the right to maintain a meaningful and ongoing relationship with the child through         the use of court ordered visitation.                  Upon a finding that the defendant in a first petition is substantially or chronically         noncompliant with a visitation order as provided in Section         . , the court may order the         defendant to attend an Education Course on Visitation Rights.                  The course shall instruct the noncompliant parent about visitation rights and               a   the importance of visitation with their child or children               b   the need for meaningful contact to ensure a continuing relationship with the child or          children and both parents                c   the harmful impact of conflict between parents over visitation access  and               d   the importance of complying with the court order.
