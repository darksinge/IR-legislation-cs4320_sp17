 LONG TITLE
            
8

    
 General Description:
            
9

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature declares that claims of the United States Forest
            
10

    
Service on state waters originating on public lands undermine state sovereignty and
            
11

    
demand action by the state of Utah to protect its sovereign, recognized ownership and
            
12

    
rights, and calls on state, county, and local governments to protect, preserve, and defend
            
13

    
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the state of Utah by defending and
            
14

    
maintaining jurisdiction over the water resources of this state.
            
15

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
16

    
    This resolution:
            
17

    
    .    affirms the rights established in the Utah Constitution related to citizens' water
            
18

    
rights and Utah's sovereign ownership and control over its water;
            
19

    
    .    declares that the actions related to claims of the United States Forest Service on
            
20

    
state waters originating on public lands undermine state sovereignty, and demand
            
21

    
action by the state of Utah to protect its sovereign, recognized ownership and rights
            
22

    
on behalf of the citizens of Utah; and
            
23

    
    .    calls on state, county, and local governments to protect, preserve, and defend their
            
24

    
jurisdictional and constitutional obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare
            
25

    
of the citizens of the state of Utah, particularly in defending and maintaining
            
26

    
jurisdiction over the water resources of this state.
            
27

    
 Special Clauses:

            
28


    
    None
            
29

    

            
30

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
31

    
    WHEREAS, water is essential to life, health, safety, and welfare, especially in Utah and
            
32

    
throughout the West;
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, in its Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act decision released June
            
34

    
28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed that jurisdiction over matters that
            
35

    
"concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people" are "possessed by the States but not
            
36

    
the Federal Government";
            
37

    
    WHEREAS, in the exercise of its jurisdiction over water resources within the state, the
            
38

    
state of Utah has long established the recognition of water rights to "first in time" users of the
            
39

    
water who can demonstrate the ability to put the water to "beneficial use";
            
40

    
    WHEREAS, in short, "beneficial use" means water use that includes domestic use,
            
41

    
irrigation, stock watering, manufacturing, mining, hydropower, municipal use, aquaculture,
            
42

    
recreation, and fish and wildlife, among others;
            
43

    
    WHEREAS, in disregard for and disrespect of the long-established state jurisdiction
            
44

    
over water resources, the federal government, principally by and through the United States
            
45

    
Forest Service (USFS), has engaged in a persistent pattern and course of conduct to exert
            
46

    
control and influence over water resources within the state and throughout the West;
            
47

    
    WHEREAS, various federal agencies are acting to negatively impact the water
            
48

    
resources of Utah and other western states by unilaterally and substantially reducing the
            
49

    
number of grazing permits and severely restricting timber harvesting;
            
50

    
    WHEREAS, these federal policies which overly restrict timber harvesting and grazing,
            
51

    
build up dangerous wildfire fuel loads and result in inordinate water absorption for unhealthy
            
52

    
vegetation densities;
            
53

    
    WHEREAS, these federal agencies are also threatening to not renew often long-held
            
54

    
grazing permits unless the permittee signs a water right change application over to the federal
            
55

    
agency, closing roads and access to water resources, diminishing water recreation
            
56

    
opportunities, and imposing onerous permit requirements;
            
57

    
    WHEREAS, some specific examples of the disregard for and disrespect of state
            
58

    
jurisdiction over water resources by federal agencies include:

            
59


    
    1.  In the spring of 2012, agents of the USFS coerced Tooele County livestock
            
60

    
producers to sign change applications on private livestock water rights under compulsion of
            
61

    
prohibiting the livestock producers from turning out their cattle onto their Forest Service
            
62

    
allotment if the producers did not comply with the federal agency demand.
            
63

    
    2.  Near Scipio, the USFS based its diligence claim filings on use by nineteenth century
            
64

    
settlers and then used the filings, and the threat of protracted litigation, to dispossess direct
            
65

    
descendants of the settlers from their legitimate water rights.
            
66

    
    3.  For many years, the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
            
67

    
Management actively sought to reduce or eliminate the livestock and watering rights of a
            
68

    
Nevada rancher.  This action resulted in protracted litigation before United States District
            
69

    
Court Judge Robert C. Jones, which concluded in the 2012 criminal convictions of two public
            
70

    
servants employed by the USFS and the Bureau of Land Management.  Both public servants
            
71

    
were found guilty of contempt of court and witness intimidation charges.  At trial, the regional
            
72

    
forester in charge of Utah was found to have lied to the court when asked about the agency's
            
73

    
antigrazing plan, which sought to eliminate cattle grazing on public lands.
            
74

    
    4.  From 2011 to the present, federal agents have barred city of Tombstone officials
            
75

    
from accessing their water resources established in the Huachuca Mountains as early as 1881,
            
76

    
which were washed out by monsoon rains on the heels of devastating wildfires exacerbated by
            
77

    
unmitigated fuel loads.  Local officials were at first denied access to repair their water lines, but
            
78

    
were then allowed by USFS agents to only use "horses and hand tools" to ascend the mountain
            
79

    
on foot in an obviously futile attempt to restore their water services.  In attempting to ascend
            
80

    
the road they had used for decades to repair their water resources with modern machinery,
            
81

    
Tombstone officials were met by armed Forest Service agents and turned back at the threat of
            
82

    
arrest and confiscation of expensive, rented heavy machinery.  The city of Tombstone is now
            
83

    
engaged in protracted litigation with the federal government over its water resources and has
            
84

    
been reduced to using arsenic-laced wells that lack the pressure and capacity to withstand any
            
85

    
serious fire danger to the wooden town in the middle of a desert in the middle of a drought.
            
86

    
    5.  The United States Forest Service filed suit in Idaho against the Joyce Livestock
            
87

    
Company, arguing the livestock water rights were the property of the United States, based on
            
88

    
federal ownership and control of the public lands coupled with the Bureau of Land
            
89

    
Management's oversight of the public lands under the Taylor Grazing Act.  Through protracted

            
90


    
litigation, the Joyce Livestock Company proved its water rights to have been in place since
            
91

    
1898.  The district court found no evidence that the United States had appropriated any water
            
92

    
by grazing livestock.  Upon appeal, in Joyce Livestock Company vs. United States, the Idaho
            
93

    
Supreme Court unanimously held that the United States did not actually apply the water to
            
94

    
beneficial use under the constitutional method of appropriation and, therefore, had no water
            
95

    
right.
            
96

    
    6.  USFS efforts to exert control over the water rights of Colorado's ski industry were
            
97

    
recently delayed on procedural grounds in a lawsuit brought by the ski industry.  The USFS,
            
98

    
through a new policy clause in the land use permitting process, seeks to require ski industry
            
99

    
interests to provide joint ownership of state water rights, relinquish water rights held jointly
            
100

    
with the federal government if the use permit is terminated, and grant "limited" power of
            
101

    
attorney to the United States to execute documents pertaining to jointly held water rights with
            
102

    
the promise that the ski industry will waive any claim against the United States for
            
103

    
compensation of water rights lost as a result of the new permit language.
            
104

    
    WHEREAS, John Dickinson, one of the Founding Fathers of this nation, warned, "It
            
105

    
will be their own faults, if the several states suffer the federal sovereignty to interfere in the
            
106

    
things of their respective jurisdictions";
            
107

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court also highlighted a vital role of states'
            
108

    
authority in relation to protecting the liberty and property of their citizens by curbing federal
            
109

    
government overreach, stating, "The Independent power of the States also serves as a check on
            
110

    
the power of the Federal Government: 'By denying any one government complete jurisdiction
            
111

    
over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from
            
112

    
arbitrary power'";
            
113

    
    WHEREAS, in its recent Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act decision, the
            
114

    
United States Supreme Court further admonished states of their jurisdiction to protect matters
            
115

    
of health, safety, and welfare, such as the critical life-sustaining issue of water in the West,
            
116

    
stating, "Our cases refer to this general power of governing, possessed by the States but not by
            
117

    
the Federal Government, as the 'police power'.   .  .  .  Because the police power is controlled by
            
118

    
50 different states instead of one national sovereign, the facets of governing that touch on
            
119

    
citizens' daily lives are normally administered by smaller governments closer to the governed. 
            
120

    
The Framers thus ensured that powers which 'in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the

            
121


    
lives, liberties, and properties of the people' were held by governments more local and more
            
122

    
accountable than a distant federal bureaucracy";
            
123

    
    WHEREAS, after recounting these fundamental principles and the states' inherent
            
124

    
powers as "separate and independent sovereigns," the United States Supreme Court
            
125

    
admonished, "In the typical case we look to the States to defend their prerogatives by adopting
            
126

    
'the simple expedient of not yielding' to federal blandishments when they do not want to
            
127

    
embrace the federal policies as their own.  The States are separate and independent sovereigns. 
            
128

    
Sometimes they have to act like it";
            
129

    
    WHEREAS, the USFS Intermountain Region Guidance Document states that the
            
130

    
federal government will not invest in livestock water improvements, "nor," according to the
            
131

    
Intermountain Region Director, "will the agency authorize water improvements to be
            
132

    
constructed or reconstructed with private funds where the right is held solely by the livestock
            
133

    
owner";
            
134

    
    WHEREAS, when the USFS allows improvements, including developing,
            
135

    
redeveloping, and maintaining a livestock permittee's water rights, all improvements are
            
136

    
claimed as the property of the United States, even when the investments are made by individual
            
137

    
livestock permittees to allow the permittees to put their livestock watering rights to beneficial
            
138

    
use as prescribed under state law;
            
139

    
    WHEREAS, the USFS has used pressure tactics to gain control of livestock water rights
            
140

    
by seeking change applications from the permittees or joint ownership in water with the federal
            
141

    
agency;
            
142

    
    WHEREAS, the USFS has threatened to not allow livestock permittees onto its Forest
            
143

    
Service grazing allotments until permittees comply with the request;
            
144

    
    WHEREAS, pre-existing water rights for livestock permittees on federal lands are
            
145

    
protected in both the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act and the 1976 Federal Land Policy and
            
146

    
Management Act;
            
147

    
    WHEREAS, these actions by federal agencies infringe on recognized state jurisdiction
            
148

    
and sovereignty, state law, and water rights established through historic livestock watering on
            
149

    
public lands, and Utah's beneficial use doctrine;
            
150

    
    WHEREAS, it is the apparent intention of the federal government to further expand its
            
151

    
water holdings in the West, including Utah, through the USFS as provided in 16 U.S.C. Sec.

            
152


    
526, which states, "There are authorized to be appropriated for expenditure by the Forest
            
153

    
Service such sums as may be necessary for the investigation and establishment of water rights,
            
154

    
including the purchase thereof or of lands or interests in lands or rights-of-way for use and
            
155

    
protection of water rights necessary or beneficial in connection with the administration and
            
156

    
public use of the national forests";
            
157

    
    WHEREAS, the United States, by and through its various agencies and departments,
            
158

    
appears intent upon undermining, or at the very least disregarding, state sovereignty and
            
159

    
jurisdiction over water rights and resources, as outlined in the USFS Intermountain Region
            
160

    
Guidance Document, which states, "until the court issues a decree accepting these claims, it is
            
161

    
not known whether these claims will be recognized as water rights";
            
162

    
    WHEREAS, in seeking to expand the federal government's interest in the Utah water
            
163

    
rights portfolio and exert greater control over the natural resources of the state, the USFS has
            
164

    
filed more than 16,000 water rights claims of ownership on livestock watering rights located
            
165

    
across the state;
            
166

    
    WHEREAS, water rights claimed by the United States, based on its control of public
            
167

    
lands, coupled with the Bureau of Land Management's comprehensive management of public
            
168

    
lands under the Taylor Grazing Act, do not constitute the application of the water right to
            
169

    
beneficial use under Utah's constitutional method of water appropriation and beneficial use;
            
170

    
    WHEREAS, these waters are the property of the citizens of the state of Utah under its
            
171

    
constitution, and the control falls under the stewardship and jurisdiction of the Utah State
            
172

    
Legislature;
            
173

    
    WHEREAS, it is recognized and understood that the United States cannot obtain
            
174

    
sovereign water rights, nor can it obtain historic livestock water rights established on public
            
175

    
lands, through federal laws;
            
176

    
    WHEREAS, the consequence of allowing the federal government to exceed its
            
177

    
authority over water rights is clearly illustrated by the great difficulty in getting the federal
            
178

    
government to acknowledge its encroachment and relinquish its hold on that which the states
            
179

    
should have by right;
            
180

    
    WHEREAS, it is the sovereign right of the state of Utah, the second most arid state in
            
181

    
the nation, to exercise its obligation to protect the scarce water resources within its borders for
            
182

    
the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens; and

            
183


    
    WHEREAS, to do otherwise would be an abrogation of the Legislature's constitutional
            
184

    
responsibility and obligation on behalf of the citizens of Utah, would weaken state authority,
            
185

    
and would relinquish to the federal government more control over the water, natural resources,
            
186

    
and lands contained within the borders of Utah:
            
187

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
188

    
affirms the rights established in the Utah Constitution related to the citizens' water and Utah's
            
189

    
sovereign ownership, jurisdiction, and control over its water.
            
190

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah declares that
            
191

    
the actions related to United States Forest Service claims on state waters originating on public
            
192

    
lands undermines state sovereignty and jurisdiction and demands action by the state of Utah to
            
193

    
protect its sovereign, recognized water ownership and rights on behalf of the citizens of Utah.
            
194

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah calls on state,
            
195

    
county, and local governments to protect, preserve, and defend their jurisdiction and exercise
            
196

    
their constitutional obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
            
197

    
state of Utah, particularly in defending and maintaining jurisdiction over the water resources of
            
198

    
this state.
            
199

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be sent to the United
            
200

    
States Department of the Interior, the United States Forest Service, the United States
            
201

    
Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management, the Utah Department of Natural
            
202

    
Resources, each county commission in the state of Utah, each municipality in the state of Utah,
            
203

    
and the members of Utah's congressional delegation.
