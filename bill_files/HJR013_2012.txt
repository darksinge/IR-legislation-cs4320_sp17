30

    
arts, culture, and museums dating to the days of the first pioneers in 1847;
            
31

    
    WHEREAS, the state's heritage, arts, culture, and museums have become an integral
            
32

    
part of Utah's rich tradition and significantly contribute to the state's economic development;
            
33

    
    WHEREAS, all Utahns benefit from the state's heritage, arts, culture, and museums;
            
34

    
    WHEREAS, the state's heritage, arts, culture, and museums need a dependable source
            
35

    
of revenue in order to continue and be preserved;
            
36

    
    WHEREAS, Title 59, Chapter 12, Part 7 enables counties to ask for the opinion of their
            
37

    
residents concerning the imposition of a sales and use tax of .10% to support cultural facilities,
            
38

    
recreational facilities, zoological facilities, botanical organizations, cultural organizations,
            
39

    
zoological organizations, and rural radio stations;
            
40

    
    WHEREAS, Title 59, Chapter 12, Part 14 enables a city or town to ask for the opinion
            
41

    
of their residents concerning the imposition of a sales and use tax of .10% to support cultural
            
42

43

    WHEREAS, the Legislature wants to know if Utah's legal voters would support the
            
45

    
imposition of a statewide sales and use tax to support Utah's heritage, arts, culture, and
            
46

    
museums;
            
47

    
    WHEREAS, revenue generated from a statewide sales and use tax could be used as a
            
48

    
reliable source of state revenue to support Utah's heritage, arts, culture, and museums, that have
            
49

    
the greatest economic impact in the state, and the revenue collected from the locally imposed
            
50

    
sales and use taxes would continue to be used in counties, cities, and towns that have imposed
            
51

    
the tax for the purposes described in Title 59, Chapter 12, Parts 7 and 14; and 
            
52

56

    
the regular general election to be held November 6, 2012:
            
57

    
    1.  Imposing a statewide sales and use tax will help preserve Utah's heritage, arts,
            
58

    
culture, and museums and will not interfere with the sales and use taxes counties, cities, and

            
59


    
towns have already imposed to support cultural, recreational, and other public purposes.
            
60

    
    2.  The state sales and use tax rate would be no higher than the difference between .15%
            
61

62

64

    
Option Funding for Botanical, Cultural, Recreational, and Zoological Organizations or
            
65

    
Facilities.  This state sales and use tax will be used to support and enhance heritage, arts,
            
66

    
culture, and museums with the greatest economic impact in the state.
            
67

    
    3.  If within the boundaries of an unincorporated area of a county, or a city or town, a
            
68

    
tax is imposed under Title 59, Chapter 12, Part 7 or 14, the local sales and use tax rate would
            
69

    
be .10% and the state sales and use tax rate would be no higher than .05%.
            
70

    
    4.  Based on the foregoing items, the Legislature hereby submits to the legal voters for
            
71

    
their opinion the following question:
            
72

    
    SHOULD THE STATE IMPOSE A SALES AND USE TAX RATE EQUAL TO THE
            
73

    
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN .15% AND THE SALES AND USE TAX RATE IMPOSED
            
74

    
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF AN UNINCORPORATED AREA OF A COUNTY OR A
            
75

    
CITY OR TOWN, under Title 59, Chapter 12, Part 7 or 14, TO SUPPORT UTAH'S
            
76

77

    
    YES
            
78

    
    NO
            
79
