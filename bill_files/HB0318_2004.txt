 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-23-04  2:06 PM

Utah Constitution Article XIII, Section 2, Subsection (6) provides that the Legislature may
exempt from property tax by statute "[t]angible personal property required by law to be
registered with the State before it is used on a public highway or waterway, on public land, or
in the air."   This constitutional provision further requires that "[i]f the Legislature exempts
[this] tangible personal property from property tax . . . it shall provide for the payment of
uniform statewide fees or uniform statewide rates of assessment or taxation on that property in
lieu of the property tax." This bill establishes multiple classes of tangible personal property and
subjects each class to a different fee schedule. Utah courts have not yet ruled on the issue of
whether the uniformity requirement of Utah Constitution Article XIII, Section 2, Subsection (6)
permits the classification of tangible personal property and the imposition of different fees on
the basis of those classes. A limited legal review of this issue suggests that it is unclear whether
a court would find that the classifications and accompanying fee schedules provided for in this
bill meet the constitutional uniformity requirement.
