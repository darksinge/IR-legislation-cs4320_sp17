527

    
shall:
            
528

    
    (a)  identify the specific matters referred for evaluation;
            
529

    
    (b)  describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the evaluation and the
            
530

    
purpose or purposes for each;
            
531

    
    (c)  state the examiner's clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue
            
532

    
referred for evaluation by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the
            
533

    
examiner could not give an opinion;
            
534

    
    (d)  state the likelihood that the minor will attain competency and the amount of time
            
535

    
estimated to achieve it; and
            
536

    
    (e)  identify the sources of information used by the examiner and present the basis for
            
537

    
the examiner's clinical findings and opinions.
            
538

    
    (9)  The examiner shall provide an initial report to the court, the prosecuting and
            
539

    
defense attorneys, and the guardian ad litem, if applicable, within 30 days of the receipt of the
            
540

    
court's order.  The report shall inform the court of the examiner's opinion concerning the
            
541

    
competency and the likelihood of the minor to proceed.  In the alternative, the examiner may
            
542

    
inform the court in writing that additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the
            
543

    
examiner informs the court that additional time is needed, the court may grant, taking into
            
544

    
consideration the custody status of the minor, up to an additional 30 days to provide the report
            
545

    
to the court and counsel.  The examiner must provide the report within 60 days from the receipt
            
546

    
of the court's order unless, for good cause shown, the court authorizes an additional period of
            
547

    
time to complete the evaluation and provide the report.
            
548

    
    (10)  Any statement made by the minor in the course of any competency evaluation,
            
549

    
whether the evaluation is with or without the consent of the minor, any testimony by the
            
550

    
examiner based upon any statement, and any other fruits of the statement may not be admitted
            
551

    
in evidence against the minor in any delinquency or criminal proceeding except on an issue
            
552

    
respecting the mental condition on which the minor has introduced evidence.  The evidence
            
553

    
may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the minor's competency.
            
554

    
    (11)  Prior to evaluating the minor, examiners shall specifically advise the minor and

            
555


    
the parents or guardian of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection (10).
            
556

    
    (12)  When the report is received the court shall set a date for a competency hearing
            
557

    
which shall be held in not less than five and not more than 15 days, unless the court enlarges
            
558

    
the time for good cause.
            
559

    
    (13)  A minor shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of the
            
560

    
evidence, finds the minor incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the proponent
            
561

    
of incompetency to proceed.
            
562

    
    (14)  If the court finds the minor incompetent to proceed, its order shall contain findings
            
563

    
addressing each of the factors in Subsection (7).
            
564

    
    Section 9.  
Section  
78A-6-1303

 is enacted to read:
            
565

    
     78A-6-1303.  Disposition on finding of incompetency to proceed -- Subsequent
            
566

    
 hearings -- Notice to prosecuting attorneys.
            
567

    
    (1)  If the court determines that the minor is not competent to proceed, the court shall
            
568

    
notify the Department of Human Services of the finding, and allow the department 30 days to
            
569

    
develop a six month attainment plan for the minor.
            
570

    
    (2)  The attainment plan shall include:
            
571

    
    (a)  any services or treatment the minor has been or is currently receiving;
            
572

    
    (b)  any additional services or treatment the minor may require to attain competency
            
573

    
within the six month time period;
            
574

    
    (c)  an assessment of the parent, custodian, or guardian's ability to access or provide any
            
575

    
recommended treatment or services;
            
576

    
    (d)  any special conditions or supervision that may be necessary for the safety of the
            
577

    
minor or others during the attainment period; and
            
578

    
    (e)  the likelihood that the minor will attain competency in a six month period.
            
579

    
    (3)  The department shall provide the attainment plan to the court, prosecutor, defense
            
580

    
attorney, and guardian ad litem at least three days prior to the competency disposition hearing.
            
581

    
    (4)  During the attainment period, the minor shall remain in the least restrictive
            
582

    
custodial setting.  If the court orders the minor to be held in detention or placed outside of the
            
583

    
home of the parent or guardian during the attainment period, the court shall make the following
            
584

    
findings on the record:
            
585

    
    (a)  the placement is the least restrictive setting;

            
586


    
    (b)  the placement is in the best interest of the minor;
            
587

    
    (c)  the minor will have access to the services and treatment required by the attainment
            
588

    
plan in the placement; and
            
589

    
    (d)  the placement is necessary for the safety of the minor or others.
            
590

    
    (5)  If the minor is held in detention pending placement in a less restrictive setting, the
            
591

    
department shall locate and transfer the minor to the alternative placement within 14 days.
            
592

    
    (6)  The court shall review the case at least once every three months to determine
            
593

    
whether the placement is still the least restrictive appropriate placement.
            
594

    
    (7)  At any time that the minor becomes competent to proceed, during the attainment
            
595

    
period, the executive director of the Department of Human Services, or its designee, shall
            
596

    
notify the court, prosecutor, defense attorney, and guardian ad litem.  The court shall hold a
            
597

    
hearing with 15 business days of notice from the executive director.
            
598

    
    (8)  If at any time, during the attainment period, the court finds that there is not a
            
599

    
substantial probability that the minor will attain competency in the foreseeable future, the court
            
600

    
shall terminate the competency proceeding, dismiss the delinquency charges without prejudice,
            
601

    
and release the minor from any custody order related to the pending delinquency proceeding,
            
602

    
unless the prosecutor informs the court that commitment proceedings pursuant to Title 62A,
            
603

    
Chapter 5, Services for People with Disabilities, or Title 62A, Chapter 15, Substance Abuse
            
604

    
and Mental Health Act, will be initiated.  These commitment proceedings shall be initiated
            
605

    
within seven days after the court's order, unless the court enlarges the time for good cause
            
606

    
shown.  The minor may be ordered to remain in custody until the commitment proceedings
            
607

    
have been concluded.
            
608

    
    (9)  During the attainment period, the court may order a hearing or rehearing at anytime
            
609

    
on its own motion or upon recommendations of any interested party or the executive director of
            
610

    
the Department of Human Services.
            
611

    
    (10)  At the conclusion of the attainment period, the department shall provide a report
            
612

    
on the minor's progress towards competence.  The report shall address the minor's:
            
613

    
    (a)  compliance with the attainment plan;
            
614

    
    (b)  progress towards competency based on the issues identified in the original
            
615

    
competency evaluation;
            
616

    
    (c)  current mental illness, intellectual disability, or related condition and need for

            
617


    
treatment, if any; and
            
618

    
    (d)  whether the minor has attained competency, or the likelihood of the minor attaining
            
619

    
competency and the amount of time necessary to attain it.
            
620

    
    (11)  The court on its own motion, or upon motion by either party or by the executive
            
621

    
director, may order an updated juvenile competency evaluation to examine the minor and
            
622

    
advise the court on the minor's current competency status and progress toward competency
            
623

    
restoration.
            
624

    
    (12)  Within 30 days of receipt of the report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine
            
625

    
the minor's current status.  At the hearing, the burden of proving the minor is competent is on
            
626

    
the proponent of competency.  The court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence
            
627

    
whether the minor is competent to proceed.
            
628

    
    (13)  If the minor has not attained competency after the initial six month attainment
            
629

    
period but is showing reasonable progress towards attainment of competency, the court may
            
630

    
extend the attainment period up to an additional six months.
            
631

    
    (14)  If the minor does not attain competency within one year after the court initially
            
632

    
finds the minor not competent to proceed, the court shall terminate the competency
            
633

    
proceedings and dismiss the delinquency charges without prejudice.
