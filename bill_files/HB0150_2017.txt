The desires of a child 14 years of age or older shall be given added65     weight, but is not the single controlling factor.66          (f)  [If interviews with the children are] If an interview with a child is conducted by the67     court pursuant to Subsection (1)(e), [they] the interview shall be conducted by the judge in68     camera.  The prior consent of the parties may be obtained but is not necessary if the court finds69     that an interview with [the children] a child is the only method to ascertain the child's desires70     regarding custody.71          (2)  In awarding custody, the court shall consider, among other factors the court finds72     relevant, which parent is most likely to act in the best interests of the child, including allowing73     the child frequent and continuing contact with the noncustodial parent as the court finds74     appropriate.75          (3)  If the court finds that one parent does not desire custody of the child, the court shall76     take that evidence into consideration in determining whether to award custody to the other77     parent.78          (4) (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (4)(b), a court may not discriminate against a79     parent due to a disability, as defined in Section 57-21-2, in awarding custody or determining80     whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award of custody.81          [(b)  If a court takes a parent's disability into account in awarding custody or82     determining whether a substantial change has occurred for the purpose of modifying an award83     of custody, the parent with a disability may rebut any evidence, presumption, or inference84     arising from the disability by showing that:]85          (b)  The court may not consider the disability of a parent as a factor in awarding86     custody, unless the court makes specific findings that:87          (i)  the disability [does not] significantly or substantially [inhibit] inhibits the parent's88     ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of the child at issue; [or] and89          (ii)  the parent with a disability [has] lacks sufficient human, monetary, or other90     resources available to supplement the parent's ability to provide for the physical and emotional91     needs of the child at issue.92          (c)  Nothing in this section may be construed to apply to adoption proceedings under93     Title 78B, Chapter 6, Part 1, Utah Adoption Act.94          (5)  This section establishes neither a preference nor a presumption for or against joint95     physical custody or sole physical custody, but allows the court and the family the widest96     discretion to choose a parenting plan that is in the best interest of the child.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
