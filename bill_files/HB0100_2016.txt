Financing of the Commission361          1.  The Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses362     of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.363          2.  The Commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources, donations, and364     grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services.365          3.  The Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member366     state or impose fees on other parties to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the367     Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover its annual budget368     as approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources.  The aggregate369     annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the370     Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.371          4.  The Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds372     adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Commission pledge the credit of any of the member373     states, except by and with the authority of the member state.374          5.  The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. 375     The receipts and disbursements of the Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting376     procedures established under its bylaws.  However, all receipts and disbursements of funds377     handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant,378     and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the379     Commission.380          F.

The members, officers, executive director, employees and representatives of the382     Commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official383     capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil384     liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred, or385     that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred386     within the scope of Commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing387     in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit and/or liability for any388     damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of389     that person.390          2.  The Commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee or391     representative of the Commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of392     any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Commission393     employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had394     a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties,395     or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from396     retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or397     omission did not result from that person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.398          3.  The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive399     director, employee, or representative of the Commission for the amount of any settlement or400     judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission401     that occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that402     such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Commission403     employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or404     omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.405     SECTION 11.  COORDINATED DATABASE406          A.  The Commission shall provide for the development and maintenance of a407     coordinated database and reporting system containing licensure, adverse action, and significant408     investigatory information on all licensed individuals in member states.409          B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of state law to the contrary, a member state410     shall submit a uniform data set to the coordinated database on all individuals to whom this411     compact is applicable as required by the rules of the Commission, including:412          1.  Identifying information;413          2.  Licensure data;414          3.  Significant investigatory information;415          4.  Adverse actions against an individual's license;416          5.  An indicator that an individual's privilege to practice is restricted, suspended or417     revoked;418          6.

Other information that may facilitate the administration of this Compact, as421     determined by the rules of the Commission.422          C.  The coordinated database administrator shall promptly notify all member states of423     any adverse action taken against, or significant investigative information on, any individual in a424     member state.425          D.  Member states contributing information to the coordinated database may designate426     information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the427     contributing state.428          E.  Any information submitted to the coordinated database that is subsequently required429     to be expunged by the laws of the member state contributing the information shall be removed430     from the coordinated database.431     SECTION 12.  RULEMAKING432          A.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set433     forth in this Section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules and amendments shall become434     binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.435          B.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a436     statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such rule shall have437     no further force and effect in any member state.438          C.  Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of439     the Commission.440          D.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and441     at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted442     upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:443          1.  On the website of the Commission; and444          2.  On the website of each member state EMS authority or the publication in which each445     state would otherwise publish proposed rules.446          E.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:447          1.  The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be448     considered and voted upon;449          2.  The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;450          3.  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and451          4.  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of452     their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.453          F.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit454     written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.455          G.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a456     rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:457          1.  At least twenty-five (25) persons;458          2.  A governmental subdivision or agency; or459          3.  An association having at least twenty-five (25) members.460          H.  If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the Commission shall461     publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.462          1.  All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of463     the Commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at464     the hearing not less than five (5) business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.465          2.  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to466     comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.467          3.  No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is468     made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the469     transcript.  A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and470     conditions as a transcript.  This subsection shall not preclude the Commission from making a471     transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.472          4.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each473     rule.  Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by474     this section.475          I.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled476     hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral477     comments received.478          J.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the479     proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking480     record and the full text of the rule.481          K.  If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is482     received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a483     public hearing.484          L.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and485     adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided486     that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be487     retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety488     (90) days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this provision, an emergency489     rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:490          1.  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;491          2.  Prevent a loss of Commission or member state funds;492          3.  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by493     federal law or rule; or494          4.  Protect public health and safety.495          M.  The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct496     revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical497     errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any498     revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission.  The revision shall be subject to499     challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting.  The revision may be500     challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge501     shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the502     notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.  If503     the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the504     Commission.505     SECTION 13.  OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT506          A.  Oversight507          1.  The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each508     member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to509     effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact and the rules510     promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.511          2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or512     administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact513     which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.514          3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such515     proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure516     to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the517     Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.518          B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination519          1.  If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance520     of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the521     Commission shall:522          a.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature523     of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by524     the Commission; and525          b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.526          2.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated527     from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,528     privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of529     termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or530     liabilities incurred during the period of default.531          3.  Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other532     means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate533     shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the534     defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.535          4.  A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and536     liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend537     beyond the effective date of termination.538          5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in539     default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between540     the Commission and the defaulting state.541          6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the542     U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission543     has its principal offices.  The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,544     including reasonable attorney's fees.545          C.  Dispute Resolution546          1.  Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes547     related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member548     states.549          2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding550     dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.551          D.  Enforcement552          1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the553     provisions and rules of this compact.554          2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States555     District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its556     principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of557     the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both558     injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing559     member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.560          3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission.  The561     Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.562     SECTION 14.  DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE563     COMMISSION FOR EMS PERSONNEL PRACTICE AND564     ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT565          A.  The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is566     enacted into law in the tenth member state.  The provisions, which become effective at that567     time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the568     promulgation of rules.  Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers569     necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.570          B.  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of571     the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes572     law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the573     full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.574          C.  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing575     the same.576          1.  A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after577     enactment of the repealing statute.578          2.  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's579     EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of580     this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.581          D.  Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any582     EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state583     and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.584          E.  This Compact may be amended by the member states.  No amendment to this585     Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the586     laws of all member states.587     SECTION 15.  CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY588          This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  If589     this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact590     shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states.  Nothing in this591     compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.Legislative Review NoteOffice of Legislative Research and General Counsel
