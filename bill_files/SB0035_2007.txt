the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, if that
            
230

    
convention is in effect between the United States and the destination country, unless one of the
            
231

    
parties objects; and
            
232

    
    (iv)  a written waiver under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  Section 552a, with respect to any

234

    
the court and the petitioner; and
            
235

    
    (f)  upon the petitioner's request, a requirement that the respondent obtain an order from

238

    
    (4)  In an abduction prevention order, the court may impose conditions on the exercise
            
239

    
of custody or visitation that:
            
240

    
    (a)  limit visitation or require that visitation with the child by the respondent be
            
241

    
supervised until the court finds that supervision is no longer necessary and order the respondent
            
242

    
to pay the costs of supervision;
            
243

    
    (b)  require the respondent to post a bond or provide other security in an amount
            
244

    
sufficient to serve as a financial deterrent to abduction, the proceeds of which may be used to
            
245

    
pay for the reasonable expenses of recovery of the child, including reasonable attorney fees and
            
246

    
costs if there is an abduction; and
            
247

    
    (c)  require the respondent to obtain education on the potentially harmful effects to the
            
248

    
child from abduction.
            
249

    
    (5)  To prevent imminent abduction of a child, a court may:
            
250

    
    (a)  issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child under Section 

78-62-109

 or the

law of this state other than this chapter;
            
252

    
    (b)  direct the use of law enforcement to take any action reasonably necessary to locate
            
253

    
the child, obtain return of the child, or enforce a custody determination under this chapter or

            
254


    
the law of this state other than this chapter; or
            
255

256

257

    
availability of other remedies to prevent abduction.
            
258

    
    Section 9.  
Section  
78-62-109

 is enacted to read:
            
259

    
     78-62-109.   Warrant to take physical custody of child.
            
260

    
    (1)  If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there is
            
261

    
a credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue
            
262

    
an ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.
            
263

    
    (2)  The respondent on a petition under Subsection (1) must be afforded an opportunity
            
264

    
to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than
            
265

    
the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible.  In that event, the court shall
            
266

    
hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.
            
267

    
    (3)  An ex parte warrant under Subsection (1) to take physical custody of a child must:
            
268

    
    (a)  recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful
            
269

    
removal of the child is based;
            
270

    
    (b)  direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;
            
271

    
    (c)  state the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and
            
272

    
    (d)  provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the
            
273

    
court.
            
274

    
    (4)  If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of the
            
275

    
child after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the
            
276

    
National Crime Information Center system and similar state databases to determine if either the
            
277

    
petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
            
278

    
    (5)  The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediately
            
279

    
after the child is taken into physical custody.
            
280

    
    (6)  A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is
            
281

    
enforceable throughout this state.  If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be

            
282


    
effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical
            
283

    
custody of the child.  If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law
            
284

    
enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
            
285

    
    (7)  If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under
            
286

    
Subsection (1) for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the
            
287

    
respondent reasonable attorney fees, costs, and other reasonable expenses and losses arising out
            
288

    
of the issuance of the ex parte warrant.
            
289

    
    (8)  This chapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under the law of this

state other than this chapter.
