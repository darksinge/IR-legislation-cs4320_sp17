 the provisions of those

    Section 7.  
Section  
78-14-5

 is amended to read:
            
411

    
     78-14-5.  Failure to obtain informed consent -- Proof required of patient --
            
412

    
 Defenses -- Consent to health care.
            
413

    
    (1) When a person submits to health care rendered by a health care provider, it shall be
            
414

    
presumed that what the health care provider did was either expressly or impliedly authorized to
            
415

    
be done. For a patient to recover damages from a health care provider in an action based upon
            
416

    
the provider's failure to obtain informed consent, the patient must prove the following:
            
417

    
    (a)  that a provider-patient relationship existed between the patient and health care
            
418

    
provider;
            
419

    
    (b)  the health care provider rendered health care to the patient;
            
420

    
    (c)  the patient suffered personal injuries arising out of the health care rendered;
            
421

    
    (d)  the health care rendered carried with it a substantial and significant risk of causing
            
422

    
the patient serious harm;
            
423

    
    (e)  the patient was not informed of the substantial and significant risk;
            
424

    
    (f)  a reasonable, prudent person in the patient's position would not have consented to
            
425

    
the health care rendered after having been fully informed as to all facts relevant to the decision
            
426

    
to give consent. In determining what a reasonable, prudent person in the patient's position
            
427

    
would do under the circumstances, the finder of fact shall use the viewpoint of the patient
            
428

    
before health care was provided and before the occurrence of any personal injuries alleged to
            
429

    
have arisen from said health care; and
            
430

    
    (g)  the unauthorized part of the health care rendered was the proximate cause of
            
431

    
personal injuries suffered by the patient.
            
432

    
    (2)  It shall be a defense to any malpractice action against a health care provider based
            
433

    
upon alleged failure to obtain informed consent if:

            
434


    
    (a)  the risk of the serious harm which the patient actually suffered was relatively
            
435

    
minor;
            
436

    
    (b)  the risk of serious harm to the patient from the health care provider was commonly
            
437

    
known to the public;
            
438

    
    (c)  the patient stated, prior to receiving the health care complained of, that he would
            
439

    
accept the health care involved regardless of the risk; or that he did not want to be informed of
            
440

    
the matters to which he would be entitled to be informed;
            
441

    
    (d)  the health care provider, after considering all of the attendant facts and
            
442

    
circumstances, used reasonable discretion as to the manner and extent to which risks were
            
443

    
disclosed, if the health care provider reasonably believed that additional disclosures could be
            
444

    
expected to have a substantial and adverse effect on the patient's condition; or
            
445

    
    (e)  the patient or his representative executed a written consent which sets forth the
            
446

    
nature and purpose of the intended health care and which contains a declaration that the patient
            
447

    
accepts the risk of substantial and serious harm, if any, in hopes of obtaining desired beneficial
            
448

    
results of health care and which acknowledges that health care providers involved have
            
449

    
explained his condition and the proposed health care in a satisfactory manner and that all
            
450

    
questions asked about the health care and its attendant risks have been answered in a manner
            
451

    
satisfactory to the patient or his representative; such written consent shall be a defense to an
            
452

    
action against a health care provider based upon failure to obtain informed consent unless the
            
453

    
patient proves that the person giving the consent lacked capacity to consent or shows by clear
            
454

    
and convincing proof that the execution of the written consent was induced by the defendant's
            
455

    
affirmative acts of fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent omission to state material facts.
            
456

    
    (3)  Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to prevent any person 18 years of
            
457

    
age or over from refusing to consent to health care for his own person upon personal or
            
458

    
religious grounds.
            
459

    
    (4)  [The] Except as provided in Section 

76-7-304.5

, the following persons are
            
460

    
authorized and empowered to consent to any health care not prohibited by law:
            
461

    
    (a)  any parent, whether an adult or a minor, for [his] the parent's minor child;
            
462

    
    (b)  any married person, for a spouse;
            
463

    
    (c)  any person temporarily standing in loco parentis, whether formally serving or not,
            
464

    
for the minor under [his] that person's care and any guardian for [his] the guardian's ward;

            
465


    
    (d)  any person 18 years of age or over for [his or her] that person's parent who is unable
            
466

    
by reason of age, physical or mental condition, to provide such consent;
            
467

    
    (e)  any patient 18 years of age or over;
            
468

    
    (f)  any female regardless of age or marital status, when given in connection with her
            
469

    
pregnancy or childbirth;
            
470

    
    (g)  in the absence of a parent, any adult for [his] the adult's minor brother or sister; and
            
471

    
    (h)  in the absence of a parent, any grandparent for [his] the grandparent's minor
            
472

    
grandchild.
            
473

    
    (5)  No person who in good faith consents or authorizes health care treatment or
            
474

    
procedures for another as provided by this act shall be subject to civil liability.
