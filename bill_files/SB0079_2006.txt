843

    
    (2)  Money held in trust by a provider is not property of the provider or its designee.

858

    
individual for any costs or fees imposed by a creditor as a result of the failure to pay or
            
859

    
misdirection.
            
860

    
    (4)  A provider may not commingle money in a trust account established for the benefit

    (6)  If a provider has established a trust account pursuant to Subsection (1), the provider
            
866

    
shall reconcile the trust account at least once a month.  The reconciliation must compare the
