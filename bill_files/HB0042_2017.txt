and2187          (B)  if the commissioner approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the2188     National Association of Insurance Commissioner's list of qualified jurisdictions, provide2189     thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed by rule made2190     in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act.2191          (iv)  United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the2192     National Association of Insurance Commissioners' financial standards and accreditation2193     program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.2194          (v)  If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction,2195     the commissioner may suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.2196          (e)  The commissioner shall:2197          (i)  assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial2198     strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies considered acceptable to the2199     commissioner by rule made in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative2200     Rulemaking Act; and2201          (ii)  publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.2202          (f)  A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding2203     insurers under this Subsection (8) at a level consistent with its rating, as specified in rules made2204     by the commissioner in accordance with Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative2205     Rulemaking Act.2206          (i)  For a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for2207     reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a2208     form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with Section 31A-17-404.1, or in a2209     multibeneficiary trust in accordance with Subsections (5), (6), and (7), except as otherwise2210     provided in this Subsection (8).2211          (ii)  If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to2212     Subsections (5), (6), and (7), and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified2213     reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate2214     trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a2215     certified reinsurer with reduced security as permitted by this Subsection (8) or comparable laws2216     of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to Subsections (5), (6), and2217     (7).2218          (iii)  It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this Subsection (8) that the2219     certified reinsurer shall have bound itself[,]:2220          (A)  by the language of the trust and agreement with the commissioner with principal2221     regulatory oversight of the trust account[,]; and2222          (B)  upon termination of the trust account, to fund, [upon termination of the trust2223     account,] out of the remaining surplus of the trust, any deficiency of any other [the] trust2224     account.2225          (iv)  The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in Subsections (5), (6), and2226     (7) are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer2227     for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this Subsection (8), except that the trust2228     shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10,000,000.2229          (v)  With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this Subsection2230     (8), if the security is insufficient, the commissioner:2231          (A)  shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency; and2232          (B)  may impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is a2233     material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.2234          (vi)  For purposes of this Subsection (8), a certified reinsurer whose certification has2235     been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure 100%2236     of its obligations.2237          (A)  As used in this Subsection (8), the term "terminated" refers to revocation,2238     suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status.2239          (B)  If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other2240     provisions of this section, the requirement under this Subsection (8)(f)(vi) does not apply to a2241     certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.2242          (g)  If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a National2243     Association of Insurance Commissioners' accredited jurisdiction, the commissioner may:2244          (i)  defer to that jurisdiction's certification;2245          (ii)  defer to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction; and2246          (iii)  consider such reinsurer to be a certified reinsurer in this state.2247          (h) (i)  A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request2248     to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify for a reduction in2249     security for its in-force business.2250          (ii)  An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable2251     requirements of this Subsection (8).2252          (iii)  The commissioner shall assign a rating to a reinsurer that qualifies under this2253     Subsection (8)(h), that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not2254     assuming new business.2255          (9)  Reinsurance credit may not be allowed a domestic ceding insurer unless the2256     assuming insurer under the reinsurance contract submits to the jurisdiction of Utah courts by:2257          (a) (i)  being an admitted insurer; and2258          (ii)  submitting to jurisdiction under Section 31A-2-309;2259          (b)  having irrevocably appointed the commissioner as the domestic ceding insurer's2260     agent for service of process in an action arising out of or in connection with the reinsurance,2261     which appointment is made under Section 31A-2-309; or2262          (c)  agreeing in the reinsurance contract:2263          (i)  that if the assuming insurer fails to perform its obligations under the terms of the2264     reinsurance contract, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall:2265          (A)  submit to the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in a state of the2266     United States;2267          (B)  comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction; and2268          (C)  abide by the final decision of the court or of an appellate court in the event of an2269     appeal; and2270          (ii)  to designate the commissioner or a specific attorney licensed to practice law in this2271     state as its attorney upon whom may be served lawful process in an action, suit, or proceeding2272     instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company.2273          (10)  Submitting to the jurisdiction of Utah courts under Subsection (9) does not2274     override a duty or right of a party under the reinsurance contract, including a requirement that2275     the parties arbitrate their disputes.2276          (11)  If an assuming insurer does not meet the requirements of Subsection (3), (4), or2277     (5), the credit permitted by Subsection (6) or (8) may not be allowed unless the assuming2278     insurer agrees in the trust instrument to the following conditions:2279          (a) (i)  Notwithstanding any other provision in the trust instrument, if an event2280     described in Subsection (11)(a)(ii) occurs the trustee shall comply with:2281          (A)  an order of the commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust; or2282          (B)  an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the2283     commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund.2284          (ii)  This Subsection (11)(a) applies if:2285          (A)  the trust fund is inadequate because the trust contains an amount less than the2286     amount required by Subsection (6)(d); or2287          (B)  the grantor of the trust is:2288          (I)  declared insolvent; or2289          (II)  placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation, or similar proceeding under the2290     laws of its state or country of domicile.2291          (b)  The assets of a trust fund described in Subsection (11)(a) shall be distributed by and2292     a claim shall be filed with and valued by the commissioner with regulatory oversight in2293     accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the2294     liquidation of a domestic insurance company.2295          (c)  If the commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust2296     fund, or any part of the assets, are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the one or more United2297     States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets, or a part of the assets, shall be2298     returned by the commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in2299     accordance with the trust instrument.2300          (d)  A grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law2301     that is inconsistent with this Subsection (11).2302          (12)  If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for2303     accreditation or certification, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's2304     accreditation or certification.2305          (a)  The commissioner shall give the reinsurer notice and opportunity for hearing.2306          (b)  The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the commissioner's2307     order after a hearing, unless:2308          (i)  the reinsurer waives its right to hearing;2309          (ii)  the commissioner's order is based on:2310          (A)  regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction; or2311          (B)  the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact2312     insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or primary certifying state2313     under Subsection (8)(g); or2314          (iii)  the commissioner's finding that an emergency requires immediate action and a2315     court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the commissioner's action.2316          (c)  While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, no reinsurance2317     contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension qualifies for credit except2318     to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with2319     Section 31A-17-404.1.2320          (d)  If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, no credit for reinsurance2321     may be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's2322     obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with Subsection (8)(f) or Section2323     31A-17-404.1.2324          (13) (a)  A ceding insurer shall take steps to manage its reinsurance recoverables2325     proportionate to its own book of business.2326          (b) (i)  A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within 30 days after2327     reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming2328     insurers:2329          (A)  exceeds 50% of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to2330     policyholders; or2331          (B)  after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming2332     insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed 50% of the domestic ceding2333     insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders.2334          (ii)  The notification required by Subsection (13)(b)(i) shall demonstrate that the2335     exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.2336          (c)  A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program.2337          (d) (i)  A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the commissioner within 30 days after2338     ceding or being likely to cede more than 20% of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in2339     the prior calendar year to any:2340          (A)  single assuming insurer;

The Legislative Management Committee has furtherdirected legislative general counsel to include legal analysis in the legislative review note onlyif legislative general counsel determines there is a high probability that a court would declarethe legislation to be unconstitutional under the Utah Constitution, the United StatesConstitution, or both. As explained in the legal analysis below, legislative general counsel hasdetermined, based on applicable state and federal constitutional language and currentinterpretations of that language in state and federal court case law, that this legislation has ahigh probability of being declared unconstitutional by a court.The bill provides confidentiality protections related to certain information concerningassessment of an entity's own risk and solvency stating that specified information may not besubject to subpoena, and may not be subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in anyprivate civil action.  Another example of these confidentiality protections includes providingthat the insurance commissioner or any person who received a document, material, or otherinformation related to an own risk and solvency assessment, through examination or otherwise,while acting under the authority of the commissioner or with whom the document, material, orother information is shared pursuant to this chapter may not be permitted or required to testifyin any private civil action concerning any confidential document, material, or information.The above described confidentiality protections create rules of procedure or evidence.  UtahConstitution, Article VIII, section 4 "expressly empowers the Supreme Court to 'adopt rules ofprocedure and evidence to be used in the courts of the state.'"  Jones v. Univ. of Utah HealthSci. Ctr, No. 100419242 (Utah 3d Dist. Ct. Jan. 13, 2012).  The Utah Supreme Court explainsthat "[s]tatutes are 'purely procedural only where they provide a 'different mode or form ofprocedure for enacting substantive rights....Procedural laws are 'concerned solely with thejudicial process.'"  State v. Drej, 233 P.3d 476, 484 (Utah 2010)(citations omitted).  Althoughthe bill provides that the information is proprietary and contains trade secrets, it createsprocedural laws concerned with the judicial process.  These protections arguably violateseparation of powers. See Jones v. Univ. of Utah Health Sci, No. 100419242. The UtahSupreme Court has provided that "[w]hile the Legislature has the constitutional authority toamend the Rules of Procedure and Evidence adopted by the Utah Supreme Court, it may onlydo so by joint resolution adopted 'upon a vote of two-thirds of all members of both houses ofthe Legislature.'"  Allred v. Saunders, 342 P.3d 204, 206 n.2 (Utah 2014)(citations omitted). See also, State v. Walker, 358 P.3d 1120, 1122-1123 (Utah 2015).  Persons can also requestthat the courts amend rules of procedure and evidence.  The Insurance Department successfullypetitioned the courts to enact rules of evidence with similar confidentiality requirements inUtah R. Evid. Rule 511, Insurance regulators. If the rules of procedure or evidence are notamended to address the confidentiality protections in this bill, there is a high probability thatthe confidentiality provisions would be struck down as unconstitutional.Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel
