 LONG TITLE
            
9

    
 General Description:
            
10

    
    This joint resolution of the Legislature demands that the federal government extinguish
            
11

    
title to Utah's public lands and transfer title to those lands to the state of Utah.
            
12

    
 Highlighted Provisions:
            
13

    
    This resolution:
            
14

    
    .    demands that the federal government transfer title of the public lands within Utah's
            
15

    
borders directly to the state of Utah;
            
16

    
    .    urges the United States Congress to engage in good faith communication,
            
17

    
cooperation, coordination, and consultation with the state of Utah regarding the
            
18

    
transfer of title of public lands directly to the state of Utah;
            
19

    
    .    declares that the Legislature, upon transfer of title of the public lands directly to the
            
20

    
state of Utah, intends to affirmatively cede the national park lands to the federal
            
21

    
government, under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United States Constitution,
            
22

    
on condition that the lands permanently remain national park lands and that they not
            
23

    
be sold, transferred, or conveyed to any party other than the state of Utah;
            
24

    
    .    declares that, upon transfer of the public lands directly to the state of Utah, the
            
25

    
Legislature intends to affirmatively cede to the federal government all lands
            
26

    
currently designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System
            
27

    
pursuant to the Wilderness Act of 1964;

            
28


    
    .    calls for the creation of a Utah Public Lands Commission to review and manage
            
29

    
multiple use of the public lands, including access, open space, and sustainable yield
            
30

    
of the abundant resources, and to determine, through a public process, the extent to
            
31

    
which public land may be sold, if any; and
            
32

    
    .    urges, to the extent that the Public Lands Commission determines through a public
            
33

    
process that any such land should be sold to private owners, that 5% of the net
            
34

    
proceeds should be paid to the Permanent Fund for public education and 95% of the
            
35

    
net proceeds should be paid to the federal government to pay down the national
            
36

    
debt.
            
37

    
 Special Clauses:
            
38

    
    None
            
39

    

            
40

    
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
41

    
    WHEREAS, in 1780, the United States Congress resolved that "the unappropriated
            
42

    
lands that may be ceded or relinquished to the United States, by any particular states, pursuant
            
43

    
to the recommendation of Congress of the 6 day of September last, shall be granted and
            
44

    
disposed of for the common benefit of all the United States that shall be members of the federal
            
45

    
union, and be settled and formed into distinct republican states, which shall become members
            
46

    
of the federal union, and have the same rights of sovereignty, freedom and independence, as the
            
47

    
other states: .  .  .  and that upon such cession being made by any State and approved and
            
48

    
accepted by Congress, the United States shall guaranty the remaining territory of the said States
            
49

    
respectively.  (Resolution of Congress, October 10, 1780)";
            
50

    
    WHEREAS, the territorial and public lands of the United States are dealt with in
            
51

    
Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the United States Constitution, referred to as the Property
            
52

    
Clause, which states, "The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules
            
53

    
and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.";
            
54

    
    WHEREAS, with this clause, the Constitutional Convention agreed that the
            
55

    
Constitution would maintain the "statu quo" that had been established with respect to the
            
56

    
federal territorial lands being disposed of only to create new states with the same rights of
            
57

    
sovereignty, freedom, and independence as the original states;
            
58

    
    WHEREAS, under these express terms of trust, the land claiming states, over time,

            
59


    
ceded their western land to their confederated Union and retained their claims that the
            
60

    
confederated government dispose of such lands only to create new states "and for no other use
            
61

    
or purpose whatsoever" and apply the net proceeds of any sales of such lands only for the
            
62

    
purpose of paying down the public debt;
            
63

    
    WHEREAS, with respect to the disposition of the federal territorial lands, the
            
64

    
Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787, provides, "The legislatures of those districts or new
            
65

    
States, shall never interfere with the primary disposal of the soil by the United States in
            
66

    
Congress assembled, nor with any regulations Congress may find necessary for securing the
            
67

    
title in such soil to the bona fide purchasers";
            
68

    
    WHEREAS, by resolution in 1790, the United States Congress declared "That the
            
69

    
proceeds of sales which shall be made of lands in the Western territory, now belonging or that
            
70

    
may hereafter belong to the United States, shall be, and are hereby appropriated towards
            
71

    
sinking or discharging the debts for the payment whereof the United States now are, or by
            
72

    
virtue of this act may be holden, and shall be applied solely to that use, until the said debt shall
            
73

    
be fully satisfied";
            
74

    
    WHEREAS, the intent of the founding fathers to eventually extinguish title to all public
            
75

    
lands was reaffirmed by President Andrew Jackson in a message to the United States Senate on
            
76

    
December 4, 1833, where he explained the reasons he vetoed a bill entitled "An act to
            
77

    
appropriate for a limited time the proceeds of the sales of the public lands of the United States
            
78

    
and for granting lands to certain States": "I do not doubt that it is the real interest of each and
            
79

    
all the States in the Union, and particularly of the new States, that the price of these lands shall
            
80

    
be reduced and graduated, and that after they have been offered for a certain number of years
            
81

    
the refuse remaining unsold shall be abandoned to the States and the machinery of our land
            
82

    
system entirely withdrawn.  It can not be supposed the compacts intended that the United States
            
83

    
should retain forever a title to lands within the States which are of no value, and no doubt is
            
84

    
entertained that the general interest would be best promoted by surrendering such lands to the
            
85

    
States";
            
86

    
    WHEREAS, in 1828, United States Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, in
            
87

    
American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 26 U.S. 511 (1828), confirmed that no provision in
            
88

    
the Constitution authorized the federal government to indefinitely exercise control over western
            
89

    
public lands beyond the duty to manage these lands pending the disposal of the lands to create

            
90


    
new states when he said, "At the time the Constitution was formed, the limits of the territory
            
91

    
over which it was to operate were generally defined and recognised (sic).  These limits
            
92

    
consisted in part, of organized states, and in part of territories, the absolute property and
            
93

    
dependencies of the United States.  These states, this territory, and future states to be admitted
            
94

    
into the Union, are the sole objects of the Constitution; there is no express provision whatever
            
95

    
made in the Constitution for the acquisition or government of territories beyond those Limits.";
            
96

    
    WHEREAS, in 1833, referring to these land cession compacts which arose from the
            
97

    
original 1780 congressional resolution, President Andrew Jackson stated, "These solemn
            
98

    
compacts, invited by Congress in a resolution declaring the purposes to which the proceeds of
            
99

    
these lands should be applied, originating before the constitution, and forming the basis on
            
100

    
which it was made, bound the United States to a particular course of policy in relation to them
            
101

    
by ties as strong as can be invented to secure the faith of nations" (Land bill veto, December 5,
            
102

    
1833);
            
103

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court, in State of Texas v. White, 74 U.S. 700
            
104

    
(1868), clarified that a state, by definition, includes a defined sovereign territory, stating that
            
105

    
"State", in the constitutional context, is "a political community of free citizens, occupying a
            
106

    
territory of defined boundaries, and organized under a government sanctioned and limited by a
            
107

    
written constitution, and established by the consent of the governed", and added, "This is
            
108

    
undoubtedly the fundamental idea upon which the republican institutions of our own country
            
109

    
are established";
            
110

    
    WHEREAS, in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U.S. 1 (1894), the United States Supreme Court
            
111

    
confirmed that all federal territories, regardless of how acquired, are held in trust to create new
            
112

    
states on an equal footing with the original states when it stated, "Upon the acquisition of a
            
113

    
Territory by the United States, whether by cession from one of the States, or by treaty with a
            
114

    
foreign country, or by discovery and settlement, the same title and dominion passed to the
            
115

    
United States, for the benefit of the whole people, and in trust for the several States to be
            
116

    
ultimately created out of the Territory.";
            
117

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that the federal government
            
118

    
must honor its trust obligation to extinguish title to the public lands for the sovereignty of the
            
119

    
new state to be complete, stating once "the United States shall have fully executed these trusts,
            
120

    
the municipal sovereignty of the new states will be complete, throughout their respective

            
121


    
borders, and they, and the original states, will be upon an equal footing, in all respects. . ."
            
122

    
(Polland v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212 (1845));
            
123

    
    WHEREAS, the enabling acts of the new states west of the original colonies established
            
124

    
the terms upon which all such states were admitted into the union, and contained the same
            
125

    
promise to all new states that the federal government would extinguish title to all public lands
            
126

    
lying within their respective borders;
            
127

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court looks upon the enabling acts which
            
128

    
create new states as "solemn compacts" and "bilateral (two-way) agreements" to be performed
            
129

    
"in a timely fashion";
            
130

    
    WHEREAS, under Section 3 of Utah's Enabling Act, Utah agreed to the same solemn
            
131

    
compacts as states preceding in statehood, that until the title to unappropriated public lands
            
132

    
lying within the state's boundaries "shall have been extinguished by the United States, the same
            
133

    
shall be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and said Indian lands shall
            
134

    
remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States; .  .  . 
            
135

    
that no taxes shall be imposed by the State on lands or property therein belonging to or which
            
136

    
may hereafter be purchased by the United States or reserved for its use";
            
137

    
    WHEREAS, the trust obligation of the federal government to timely extinguish title of
            
138

    
all public lands lying within the boundaries of the state of Utah is made even more clear in
            
139

    
Section 9 of Utah's Enabling Act as follows: "That five per centum of the proceeds of the sales
            
140

    
of public lands lying within said State, which shall be sold by the United States subsequent to
            
141

    
the admission of said State into the Union, after deducting all the expenses incident to the
            
142

    
same, shall be paid to the said State, to be used as a Permanent Fund, the interest of which only
            
143

    
shall be expended for the support of the common schools within said State";
            
144

    
    WHEREAS, the federal government confirmed its trust obligation to timely extinguish
            
145

    
title to all public lands lying within the boundaries of the state of Utah by and through the 1934
            
146

    
Taylor Grazing Act which declared that the act was established "In order to promote the
            
147

    
highest use of the public lands pending its final disposal";
            
148

    
    WHEREAS, in 1976, after nearly 200 years of trust history regarding the obligation of
            
149

    
Congress to extinguish title of western lands to create new states and use the proceeds to
            
150

    
discharge its public debts, the United States Congress purported to unilaterally change this
            
151

    
solemn promise by and through the Federal Land Policy Management Act (FLPMA), which

            
152


    
provides, in part, "The Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States that the
            
153

    
public lands be retained in Federal ownership, unless . . .  it is determined that disposal of a
            
154

    
particular parcel will serve the federal interest";
            
155

    
    WHEREAS, at the time of Utah's Enabling Act the course and practice of the United
            
156

    
States Congress with all prior states admitted to the Union had been to fully extinguish title,
            
157

    
within a reasonable time, to all lands within the boundaries of such states, except for those
            
158

    
Indian lands, or lands otherwise expressly reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
            
159

    
States;
            
160

    
    WHEREAS, the state of Utah did not, and could not have, contemplated or bargained
            
161

    
for the United States failing or refusing to abide by its solemn promise to extinguish title to all
            
162

    
lands within its defined boundaries within a reasonable time such that the state of Utah and its
            
163

    
Permanent Fund for its Common Schools could never realize the bargained-for benefit of the
            
164

    
deployment, taxation, or economic benefit of all the lands within its defined boundaries;
            
165

    
    WHEREAS, from 1780 forward the federal government only held bare legal title to the
            
166

    
western public lands in the nature of a trustee in trust with the solemn obligation to timely
            
167

    
extinguish title to such lands to create new states and to use the proceeds to pay the public debt;
            
168

    
    WHEREAS, the federal government complied with its promise and solemn obligation
            
169

    
to imminently transfer title of public lands lying within the boundaries of all states to the
            
170

    
eastern edge of the state of Colorado and also with the state of Hawaii;
            
171

    
    WHEREAS, by the terms of Utah's Enabling Act, Utah suspended its sovereign right to
            
172

    
eventually tax the public lands within its borders, pending final disposition of the public lands;
            
173

    
    WHEREAS, the federal government has repeatedly and persistently failed to honor its
            
174

    
promises and has refused to abide by the terms of its preexisting solemn obligations to
            
175

    
imminently extinguish title to all public lands;
            
176

    
    WHEREAS, had Congress honored its promise to Utah to timely extinguish title to all
            
177

    
public lands within Utah's boundaries, Utah would have had sovereign control over lands
            
178

    
within its borders;
            
179

    
    WHEREAS, Congress, by and through FLPMA, unilaterally altered its duty in 1976 to
            
180

    
extinguish title to all public lands within Utah's borders by committing to a policy of retention
            
181

    
and a process of comprehensive land management and planning coordinated between the
            
182

    
federal government, the states, and local governing bodies for access, multiple use, and

            
183


    
sustained yield of the public lands;
            
184

    
    WHEREAS, despite the fact that the federal government had not divested all public
            
185

    
lands within Utah's borders by 1976, this did not alleviate the federal government from its duty
            
186

    
to extinguish title and divest itself of federal ownership of remaining public land in Utah by
            
187

    
ceding such land directly to the state as it did with other states;
            
188

    
    WHEREAS, since the passage of FLPMA, the federal government has engaged in a
            
189

    
persistent pattern and course of conduct in direct violation of the letter and spirit of FLPMA
            
190

    
through an abject disregard of local resource management plans, failure and refusal to
            
191

    
coordinate and cooperate with the state and local governments, unilateral and oppressive land
            
192

    
control edicts to the severe and extreme detriment of the state and its ability to adequately fund
            
193

    
education, provide essential government services, secure economic opportunities for wage
            
194

    
earners and Utah business, and ensure a stable prosperous future;
            
195

    
    WHEREAS, under the United State Constitution, the American states reorganized to
            
196

    
form a more perfect union, yielding up certain portions of their sovereign powers to the elected
            
197

    
officers of the government of their union, yet retaining the residuum of sovereignty for the
            
198

    
purpose of independent internal self-governance;
            
199

    
    WHEREAS, by compact between the original states, territorial lands were divided into
            
200

    
"suitable extents of territory" and upon attaining a certain population, were to be admitted into
            
201

    
the union upon "an equal footing" as members possessing "the same rights of sovereignty,
            
202

    
freedom and independence" as the original states;
            
203

    
    WHEREAS, the federal trust respecting public lands obligates the United States,
            
204

    
through their agent, Congress, to extinguish both their government jurisdiction and their title
            
205

    
on the public lands that are held in trust by the United States for the states in which they are
            
206

    
located;
            
207

    
    WHEREAS, the state and federal partnership of public lands management has been
            
208

    
eroded by an oppressive and over-reaching federal management agenda that has adversely
            
209

    
impacted the sovereignty and the economies of the state of Utah and local governments;
            
210

    
    WHEREAS, federal land-management actions, even when applied exclusively to
            
211

    
federal lands, directly impact the ability of the state of Utah to manage its school trust lands in
            
212

    
accordance with the mandate of the Utah Enabling Act and to meet its obligation to the
            
213

    
beneficiaries of the trust;

            
214


    
    WHEREAS, Utah has been substantially damaged in its ability to provide funding for
            
215

    
education and the common good of the state and to serve a sustainable, vibrant economy into
            
216

    
the future because the federal government has unduly retained control of nearly two-thirds of
            
217

    
the lands lying within Utah's borders;
            
218

    
    WHEREAS, Utah consistently ranks highest among all the states in class size and
            
219

    
lowest in the nation in per pupil spending for education;
            
220

    
    WHEREAS, had the federal government disposed of the land in or about 1896, Utah
            
221

    
would have, from that point forward, generated substantial tax revenues and revenues from the
            
222

    
sustainable managed use of its natural resources to the benefit of its public schools and to the
            
223

    
common good of the state and nation;
            
224

    
    WHEREAS, the federal government gives Utah less than half of the net proceeds of
            
225

    
mineral lease revenues and severance taxes generated from the lands within Utah's borders;
            
226

    
    WHEREAS, Utah has been substantially damaged in mineral lease revenues and
            
227

    
severance taxes in that, had the federal government extinguished title to all public lands, Utah
            
228

    
would realize 100% of the mineral lease revenues and severance taxes from the lands;
            
229

    
    WHEREAS, the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) failure to act affirmatively on
            
230

    
definitive allocation decisions of multiple use activities in resource management plans has
            
231

    
created uncertainty in the future of public land use in Utah and has caused capital to flee the
            
232

    
state;
            
233

    
    WHEREAS, during the process of finalizing the most recent six Resource Management
            
234

    
Plans, the BLM refused to consider state and local government acknowledgments of R.S. 2477
            
235

    
rights-of-way or other evidence of the existence of R.S. 2477 rights-of-way in the Grand
            
236

    
Staircase Escalante National Monument;
            
237

    
    WHEREAS, the BLM has demonstrated a chronic inability to handle the proliferation
            
238

    
of wild horses and burros on the public lands, to the detriment of the rangeland resource;
            
239

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to extend its
            
240

    
jurisdiction to regulate the waters of the United States to areas traditionally dry, except during
            
241

    
severe weather events, in violation of the common definition of jurisdictional waters;
            
242

    
    WHEREAS, in 1996 the president of the United States abused the intent of the
            
243

    
Antiquities Act by the creation of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument without
            
244

    
any consultation with the state and local authorities or citizens;

            
245


    
    WHEREAS, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service is making decisions
            
246

    
concerning various species on BLM lands under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act
            
247

    
without serious consideration of state wildlife management activities and protection designed
            
248

    
to prevent the need for a listing, or recognizing the ability to delist a species, thereby affecting
            
249

    
the economic vitality of the state and local region;
            
250

    
    WHEREAS, the BLM has not authorized all necessary rangeland improvement projects
            
251

    
involving the removal of pinyon-juniper and other climax vegetation, thereby reducing the
            
252

    
biological diversity of the range, reducing riparian viability and water quality, and reducing the
            
253

    
availability of forage for both livestock and wildlife;
            
254

    
    WHEREAS, Utah initially supported placing into reserve the six National Forests in
            
255

    
Utah -- Ashley, Fishlake, Manti La-Sal, Dixie, Uinta, and Wasatch-Cache, because Utah was
            
256

    
promised this action would preserve the forest lands as watersheds and for agricultural use --
            
257

    
namely timber and other wood products, and grazing;
            
258

    
    WHEREAS, this vision and promise of agricultural production on the forest lands is the
            
259

    
reason that the United States Forest Service was made part of the United States Department of
            
260

    
Agriculture as opposed to the Department of the Interior;
            
261

    
    WHEREAS, the promise of preservation for agricultural use has been broken by the
            
262

    
current and recent administrations;
            
263

    
    WHEREAS, logging, timber, and wood products operations on Utah's National Forests
            
264

    
have come to a virtual standstill, resulting in forests that are choked with old growth
            
265

    
monocultures, loss of aspen diversity, loss of habitat, and a threat to community watersheds
            
266

    
due to insect infestation and catastrophic fire;
            
267

    
    WHEREAS, these conditions are the result of a failure to properly manage the forest
            
268

    
lands for their intended use, which is responsible and sustained timber production, watersheds
            
269

    
and grazing;
            
270

    
    WHEREAS, the only remedy for federal government breaches of Utah's Enabling Act
            
271

    
Compact and breaches to the spirit and letter of the promises of FLPMA is for the state of Utah
            
272

    
to take back title and management responsibility of federally-managed public lands, which
            
273

    
would restore the promises in the solemn compact made at statehood;
            
274

    
    WHEREAS, under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United States Constitution, the
            
275

    
federal government is only constitutionally authorized to exercise jurisdiction over and above

            
276


    
bare right and title over lands that are "purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State
            
277

    
in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and
            
278

    
other needful Buildings";
            
279

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court affirmed that the federal government
            
280

    
only holds lands as a mere "ordinary proprietor" and cannot exert jurisdictional dominion and
            
281

    
control over public lands without the consent of the state Legislature, stating "Where lands are
            
282

    
acquired without such consent, the possession of the United States, unless political jurisdiction
            
283

    
be ceded to them in some other way, is simply that of an ordinary proprietor (emphasis added). 
            
284

    
The property in that case, unless used as a means to carry out the purposes of the government,
            
285

    
is subject to the legislative authority and control of the states equally with the property of
            
286

    
private individuals."(Ft. Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525 (1885));
            
287

    
    WHEREAS, in a unanimous 2009 decision, the United States Supreme Court, in
            
288

    
Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.S. 163 (2009), affirmed that Congress has no right
            
289

    
to change the promises it made to a state's Enabling Act, stating, ".  .  .  [a subsequent act of
            
290

    
Congress] would raise grave constitutional concerns if it purported to 'cloud' Hawaii's title to
            
291

    
its sovereign lands more than three decades after the State's admission to the Union .  .  . 
            
292

    
'[T]he consequences of admission are instantaneous, and it ignores the uniquely sovereign
            
293

    
character of that event . . . to suggest that subsequent events somehow can diminish what has
            
294

    
already been bestowed'.  And that proposition applies a fortiori [with even greater force]
            
295

    
where virtually all of the State's public lands .  .  . are at stake" (emphasis added, citation

298

    
responsible stewardship of lands within state jurisdiction;
            
299

    
    WHEREAS, the state of Utah is willing to sponsor, evaluate, and advance the locally
            
300

    
driven efforts in a more efficient manner than the federal government, to the benefit of all
            
301

    
users, including recreation, conservation, and the responsible and sustainable management of
            
302

    
Utah's natural resources;
            
303

    
    WHEREAS, the state of Utah has a proven regulatory structure to manage public lands
            
304

    
for multiple use and sustainable yield;
            
305

    
    WHEREAS, the United States Congress disposed of lands within the boundaries of the
            
306

    
states of Tennessee and Hawaii directly to those states;

            
307


    
    WHEREAS, because of the entanglements and rights arising over the 116 years that the
            
308

    
federal government has failed to honor its promise to timely extinguish title to public lands and
            
309

    
because of the federal government's breach of Utah's Enabling Act and breach of FLPMA,
            
310

    
among other promises made, and the damages resulting from such breaches, the United States
            
311

    
Congress should imminently transfer title to all public lands lying within the State of Utah

directly to the State of Utah, as it did with Hawaii and Tennessee;

government of the public lands directly to the state, intends to cede the national park land to the

federal government on condition that the lands permanently remain national park lands, that

317

    
Utah;

    WHEREAS, the Legislature of the state of Utah, upon transfer of title by the federal

government of the public lands directly to the state, intends to cede to the federal government
            
320

    
all lands currently designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System pursuant

expectations over Utah's public lands, including open space, access, multiple use, and the
            
324

    
management of sustainable yields of Utah's natural resources, a Utah Public Lands

public process that any such land should be sold to private owners, that 5% of the net proceeds

331

    
    NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah
            
332

    
demands that the federal government imminently transfer title to all of the public lands within
            
333

    
Utah's borders directly to the state of Utah.
            
334

    
    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Legislature of the state of Utah urges the
