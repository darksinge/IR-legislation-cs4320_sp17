695

    
is limited.  After that time the court shall base its custody decision on the best interest of the
            
696

    
child.
            
697

    
    (c)  Prior to the expiration of the 120-day period described in Subsection (18)(a), the

following order of preference shall be applied when determining the person with whom a child
            
699

    
will be placed, provided that the person is willing, and has the ability, to care for the child:
            
700

    (iv)  other placements that are consistent with the requirements of law.
            
705

    
    (d)  In determining whether a friend is a willing and appropriate placement for a child,

707

    
each parent of the child.
            
708

    
    (e)  If a parent of the child is not able to designate a friend who is a licensed foster
            
709

    
parent for placement of the child, but is able to identify a friend who is willing to become
            
710

    
licensed as a foster parent:
            
711

    
    (i)  the department shall fully cooperate to expedite the licensing process for the friend;
            
712

    
and
            
713

    
    (ii)  if the friend becomes licensed as a foster parent within the time frame described in
            
714

    
Subsection (18)(a), the court shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to
            
715

    
place the child with the friend.
            
716

    
    (19)  If, following the shelter hearing, the child is placed with a person who is not a
            
717

    
parent of the child, a relative of the child, a friend of a parent of the child, or a former foster
            
718

    
parent of the child, priority shall be given to a foster placement with a man and a woman who
            
719

    
are married to each other, unless it is in the best interests of the child to place the child with a
            
720

    
single foster parent.
            
721

    
    (20)  In determining the placement of a child, neither the court, nor the division, may
            
722

    
take into account, or discriminate against, the religion of a person with whom the child may be
            
723

    
placed, unless the purpose of taking religion into account is to place the child with a person or
            
724

    
family of the same religion as the child.

reasonable parent-time with the parent or parents from whose custody the minor was removed,
            
746

    
unless parent-time is not in the best interest of the minor.
            
747

    
    (4)  In cases where obvious sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abandonment, severe
            
748

    
abuse, or severe neglect are involved, neither the division nor the court has any duty to make
            
749

    
"reasonable efforts" or to, in any other way, attempt to provide reunification services, or to
            
750

    
attempt to rehabilitate the offending parent or parents.
            
751

    
    (5)  In all cases, the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the court's paramount
            
752

    
concern in determining whether reasonable efforts to reunify should be made.
            
753

    
    (6)  For purposes of Subsection (3), parent-time is in the best interests of a minor unless
            
754

    
the court makes a finding that it is necessary to deny parent-time in order to:
            
755

    
    (a)  protect the physical safety of the minor;
            
756

    
    (b)  protect the life of the minor; or
            
757

    
    (c)  prevent the minor from being traumatized by contact with the parent due to the

            
758


    
minor's fear of the parent in light of the nature of the alleged abuse or neglect.
            
759

    
    (7)  Notwithstanding Subsection (3), a court may not deny parent-time based solely on a
            
760

    
parent's failure to:
            
761

    
    (a)  prove that the parent has not used legal or illegal substances; or
            
762

    
    (b)  comply with an aspect of the child and family plan that is ordered by the court.
            
763

    
    (8)  In addition to the primary permanency goal, the court shall establish a concurrent
            
764

    
permanency goal that shall include:
            
765

    
    (a)  a representative list of the conditions under which the primary permanency goal
            
766

    
will be abandoned in favor of the concurrent permanency goal; and
            
767

    
    (b)  an explanation of the effect of abandoning or modifying the primary permanency
            
768

    
goal.
            
769

    
    (9)  A permanency hearing shall be conducted in accordance with Subsection
            
770

    

78A-6-314

(1)(b) within 30 days after the day on which the dispositional hearing ends if
            
771

    
something other than reunification is initially established as a minor's primary permanency
            
772

    
goal.
            
773

    
    (10) (a)  The court may amend a minor's primary permanency goal before the
            
774

    
establishment of a final permanency plan under Section 

78A-6-314

.
            
775

    
    (b)  The court is not limited to the terms of the concurrent permanency goal in the event
            
776

    
that the primary permanency goal is abandoned.
            
777

    
    (c)  If, at any time, the court determines that reunification is no longer a minor's primary
            
778

    
permanency goal, the court shall conduct a permanency hearing in accordance with Section
            
779

    

78A-6-314

 on or before the earlier of:
            
780

    
    (i)  30 days after the day on which the court makes the determination described in this
            
781

    
Subsection (10)(c); or
            
782

    
    (ii)  the day on which the provision of reunification services, described in Section
            
783

    

78A-6-314

, ends.
            
784

    
    (11) (a)  If the court determines that reunification services are appropriate, it shall order
            
785

    
that the division make reasonable efforts to provide services to the minor and the minor's

            
786


    
parent for the purpose of facilitating reunification of the family, for a specified period of time.
            
787

    
    (b)  In providing the services described in Subsection (11)(a), the minor's health, safety,
            
788

    
and welfare shall be the division's paramount concern, and the court shall so order.
            
789

    
    (12) (a)  The court shall:
            
790

    
    [(a)] (i)  determine whether the services offered or provided by the division under the
            
791

    
child and family plan constitute "reasonable efforts" on the part of the division;
            
792

    
    [(b)] (ii)  determine and define the responsibilities of the parent under the child and
            
793

    
family plan in accordance with Subsection 

62A-4a-205

(6)(e); and
            
794

    
    [(c)] (iii)  identify verbally on the record, or in a written document provided to the
            
795

    
parties, the responsibilities described in Subsection (12)[(b)](a)(ii), for the purpose of assisting
            
796

    
in any future determination regarding the provision of reasonable efforts, in accordance with
            
797

    
state and federal law.
            
798

    
    (b)  If the parent is in a substance abuse treatment program, other than a certified drug
            
799

    
court program:
            
800

    
    (i)  the court may order the parent to submit to supplementary drug or alcohol testing in
            
801

    
addition to the testing recommended by the parent's substance abuse program based on a
            
802

    
finding of reasonable suspicion that the parent is abusing drugs or alcohol; and
            
803

    
    (ii)  the court may order the parent to provide the results of drug or alcohol testing
            
804

    
recommended by the substance abuse program to the court or division.
            
805

    
    (13) (a)  The time period for reunification services may not exceed 12 months from the
            
806

    
date that the minor was initially removed from the minor's home, unless the time period is
            
807

    
extended under Subsection 

78A-6-314

(8).
            
808

    
    (b)  Nothing in this section may be construed to entitle any parent to an entire 12
            
809

    
months of reunification services.
            
810

    
    (14) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, the court may terminate those services at
            
811

    
any time.
            
812

    
    (b)  If, at any time, continuation of reasonable efforts to reunify a minor is determined
            
813

    
to be inconsistent with the final permanency plan for the minor established pursuant to Section

            
814


    

78A-6-314

, then measures shall be taken, in a timely manner, to:
            
815

    
    (i)  place the minor in accordance with the permanency plan; and
            
816

    
    (ii)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the
            
817

    
minor.
            
818

    
    (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period
            
819

    
described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.
            
820

    
    (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
821

    
by the court in accordance with Section 

78A-6-314

 at the expiration of the time period for
            
822

    
reunification services.
            
823

    
    (b)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original
            
824

    
removal of the minor.
            
825

    
    (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted
            
826

    
within 30 days, in accordance with Section 

78A-6-314

.
            
827

    
    (17)  With regard to a minor who is 36 months of age or younger at the time the minor
            
828

    
is initially removed from the home, the court shall:
            
829

    
    (a)  hold a permanency hearing eight months after the date of the initial removal,
            
830

    
pursuant to Section 

78A-6-314

; and
            
831

    
    (b)  order the discontinuance of those services after eight months from the initial
            
832

    
removal of the minor from the home if the parent or parents have not made substantial efforts
            
833

    
to comply with the child and family plan.
            
834

    
    (18)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are
            
835

    
ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six
            
836

    
months from the date that reunification services were ordered:
            
837

    
    (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services; and
            
838

    
    (b)  the division shall petition the court for termination of parental rights.
            
839

    
    (19)  When a court conducts a permanency hearing for a minor under Section
            
840

    

78A-6-314

, the court shall attempt to keep the minor's sibling group together if keeping the
            
841

    
sibling group together is:

            
842


    
    (a)  practicable; and
            
843

    
    (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.
            
844

    
    (20) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide
            
845

    
permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a
            
846

    
parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.
            
847

    
    (b)  The court may determine that:
            
848

    
    (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,
            
849

    
based on the individual circumstances; and
            
850

    
    (ii)  reunification services should not be provided.
            
851

    
    (c)  In determining "reasonable efforts" to be made with respect to a minor, and in
            
852

    
making "reasonable efforts," the minor's health, safety, and welfare shall be the paramount
            
853

    
concern.
            
854

    
    (21)  There is a presumption that reunification services should not be provided to a
            
855

    
parent if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that any of the following
            
856

    
circumstances exist:
            
857

    
    (a)  the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, based upon a verified affidavit
            
858

    
indicating that a reasonably diligent search has failed to locate the parent;
            
859

    
    (b)  subject to Subsection (22)(a), the parent is suffering from a mental illness of such
            
860

    
magnitude that it renders the parent incapable of utilizing reunification services;
            
861

    
    (c)  the minor was previously adjudicated as an abused child due to physical abuse,
            
862

    
sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, and following the adjudication the minor:
            
863

    
    (i)  was removed from the custody of the minor's parent;
            
864

    
    (ii)  was subsequently returned to the custody of the parent; and
            
865

    
    (iii)  is being removed due to additional physical abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual
            
866

    
exploitation;
            
867

    
    (d)  the parent:
            
868

    
    (i)  caused the death of another minor through abuse or neglect;
            
869

    
    (ii)  committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit:

            
870


    
    (A)  murder or manslaughter of a child; or
            
871

    
    (B)  child abuse homicide;
            
872

    
    (iii)  committed sexual abuse against the child; or
            
873

    
    (iv)  is a registered sex offender or required to register as a sex offender;
            
874

    
    (e)  the minor suffered severe abuse by the parent or by any person known by the
            
875

    
parent, if the parent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was abusing the
            
876

    
minor;
            
877

    
    (f)  the minor is adjudicated an abused child as a result of severe abuse by the parent,
            
878

    
and the court finds that it would not benefit the minor to pursue reunification services with the
            
879

    
offending parent;
            
880

    
    (g)  the parent's rights are terminated with regard to any other minor;
            
881

    
    (h)  the minor [is] was removed from the minor's home on at least two previous
            
882

    
occasions and reunification services were offered or provided to the family at those times;
            
883

    
    (i)  the parent has abandoned the minor for a period of six months or longer;
            
884

    
    (j)  the parent permitted the child to reside, on a permanent or temporary basis, at a
            
885

    
location where the parent knew or should have known that a clandestine laboratory operation
            
886

    
was located;
            
887

    
    (k)  except as provided in Subsection (22)(b), with respect to a parent who is the child's
            
888

    
birth mother, the child has fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or was
            
889

    
exposed to an illegal or prescription drug that was abused by the child's mother while the child
            
890

    
was in utero, if the child was taken into division custody for that reason, unless the mother
            
891

    
agrees to enroll in, is currently enrolled in, or has recently and successfully completed a
            
892

    
substance abuse treatment program approved by the department; or
            
893

    
    (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification
            
894

    
efforts or services.
            
895

    
    (22) (a)  The finding under Subsection (21)(b) shall be based on competent evidence
            
896

    
from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing
            
897

    
that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately

            
898


    
caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is made.
            
899

    
    (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection (21)(k) if the court finds, under
            
900

    
the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection
            
901

    
(21)(k) is not warranted.
            
902

    
    (23)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take
            
903

    
into consideration:
            
904

    
    (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child
            
905

    
and family plan;
            
906

    
    (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of
            
907

    
drugs or alcohol;
            
908

    
    (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family
            
909

    
member;
            
910

    
    (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;
            
911

    
    (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;
            
912

    
    (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be
            
913

    
successful; and
            
914

    
    (g)  whether the parent has expressed an interest in reunification with the minor.
            
915

    
    (24) (a)  If reunification services are not ordered pursuant to Subsections (20) through
            
916

    
(22), and the whereabouts of a parent become known within six months after the day on which
            
917

    
the out-of-home placement of the minor is made, the court may order the division to provide
            
918

    
reunification services.
            
919

    
    (b)  The time limits described in Subsections (2) through (19) are not tolled by the
            
920

    
parent's absence.
            
921

    
    (25) (a)  If a parent is incarcerated or institutionalized, the court shall order reasonable
            
922

    
services unless it determines that those services would be detrimental to the minor.
            
923

    
    (b)  In making the determination described in Subsection (25)(a), the court shall
            
924

    
consider:
            
925

    
    (i)  the age of the minor;

            
926


    
    (ii)  the degree of parent-child bonding;
            
927

    
    (iii)  the length of the sentence;
            
928

    
    (iv)  the nature of the treatment;
            
929

    
    (v)  the nature of the crime or illness;
            
930

    
    (vi)  the degree of detriment to the minor if services are not offered;
            
931

    
    (vii)  for a minor 10 years of age or older, the minor's attitude toward the
            
932

    
implementation of family reunification services; and
            
933

    
    (viii)  any other appropriate factors.
            
934

    
    (c)  Reunification services for an incarcerated parent are subject to the time limitations
            
935

    
imposed in Subsections (2) through (19).
            
936

    
    (d)  Reunification services for an institutionalized parent are subject to the time
            
937

    
limitations imposed in Subsections (2) through (19), unless the court determines that continued
            
938

    
reunification services would be in the minor's best interest.
            
939

    
    (26)  If, pursuant to Subsections (21)(b) through (l), the court does not order
            
940

    
reunification services, a permanency hearing shall be conducted within 30 days, in accordance
            
941

    
with Section 

78A-6-314

.
            
942
