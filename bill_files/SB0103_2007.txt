11

    
related to an individual's  unreported or underreported work or earnings, or both, in

17

    
underreports work or earnings, or both, for a particular week does not lose eligibility
            
18

    
for that week because of the misreporting if the claimant would have been eligible
            
19

    
for benefits had the information been reported correctly; and
            
20

    
    .    provides that a claimant who does not report or underreports work or earnings, or

AMENDS:
            
28

    
     35A-4-405, as last amended by Chapter 7, Laws of Utah 2004
            
29

    


            
30


    
Be it enacted by the Legislature of the state of Utah:
            
31

    
    Section 1.  
Section  
35A-4-405

 is amended to read:
            
32

    
     35A-4-405.  Ineligibility for benefits.
            
33

    
    Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (5), an individual is ineligible for benefits
            
34

    
or for purposes of establishing a waiting period:
            
35

    
    (1) (a)  For the week in which the claimant left work voluntarily without good cause, if
            
36

    
so found by the division, and for each week thereafter until the claimant has performed services
            
37

    
in bona fide, covered employment and earned wages for those services equal to at least six
            
38

    
times the claimant's weekly benefit amount.
            
39

    
    (b)  A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits if the claimant leaves work
            
40

    
under circumstances where it would be contrary to equity and good conscience to impose a
            
41

    
disqualification.
            
42

    
    (c)  Using available information from employers and the claimant, the division shall
            
43

    
consider for the purposes of this chapter the reasonableness of the claimant's actions, and the
            
44

    
extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing attachment to the labor market in
            
45

    
reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a claimant is contrary to equity and
            
46

    
good conscience.
            
47

    
    (d)  Notwithstanding any other subsection of this section, a claimant who has left work
            
48

    
voluntarily to accompany, follow, or join the claimant's spouse to or in a new locality does so
            
49

    
without good cause for purposes of Subsection (1).
            
50

    
    (2) (a)  For the week in which the claimant was discharged for just cause or for an act or
            
51

    
omission in connection with employment, not constituting a crime, which is deliberate, willful,
            
52

    
or wanton and adverse to the employer's rightful interest, if so found by the division, and
            
53

    
thereafter until the claimant has earned an amount equal to at least six times the claimant's
            
54

    
weekly benefit amount in bona fide covered employment.
            
55

    
    (b)  For the week in which the claimant was discharged for dishonesty constituting a
            
56

    
crime or any felony or class A misdemeanor in connection with the claimant's work as shown
            
57

    
by the facts, together with the claimant's admission, or as shown by the claimant's conviction of

            
58


    
that crime in a court of competent jurisdiction and for the 51 next following weeks.
            
59

    
    (c)  Wage credits shall be deleted from the claimant's base period, and are not available
            
60

    
for this or any subsequent claim for benefits.
            
61

    
    (3) (a) (i)  If the division finds that the claimant has failed without good cause to
            
62

    
properly apply for available suitable work, to accept a referral to suitable work offered by the
            
63

    
employment office, or to accept suitable work offered by an employer or the employment
            
64

    
office.
            
65

    
    (ii)  The ineligibility continues until the claimant has performed services in bona fide
            
66

    
covered employment and earned wages for the services in an amount equal to at least six times
            
67

    
the claimant's weekly benefit amount.
            
68

    
    (b) (i)  A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits for failure to apply, accept
            
69

    
referral, or accept available suitable work under circumstances where it would be contrary to
            
70

    
equity and good conscience to impose a disqualification.
            
71

    
    (ii)  The division shall consider the purposes of this chapter, the reasonableness of the
            
72

    
claimant's actions, and the extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing
            
73

    
attachment to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a
            
74

    
claimant is contrary to equity and good conscience.
            
75

    
    (c)  In determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the division shall
            
76

    
consider the:
            
77

    
    (i)  degree of risk involved to his health, safety, and morals;
            
78

    
    (ii)  individual's physical fitness and prior training;
            
79

    
    (iii)  individual's prior earnings and experience;
            
80

    
    (iv)  individual's length of unemployment;
            
81

    
    (v)  prospects for securing local work in his customary occupation;
            
82

    
    (vi)  wages for similar work in the locality; and
            
83

    
    (vii)  distance of the available work from his residence.
            
84

    
    (d)  Prior earnings shall be considered on the basis of all four quarters used in
            
85

    
establishing eligibility and not just the earnings from the most recent employer.  The division

            
86


    
shall be more prone to find work as suitable the longer the claimant has been unemployed and
            
87

    
the less likely the prospects are to secure local work in his customary occupation.
            
88

    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work is suitable, and
            
89

    
benefits may not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing
            
90

    
to accept new work under any of the following conditions:
            
91

    
    (i)  if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor
            
92

    
dispute;
            
93

    
    (ii)  if the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less
            
94

    
favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; or
            
95

    
    (iii)  if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a
            
96

    
company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.
            
97

    
    (4)  For any week in which the division finds that the claimant's unemployment is due
            
98

    
to a stoppage of work that exists because of a strike involving the claimant's grade, class, or
            
99

    
group of workers at the factory or establishment at which the claimant is or was last employed.
            
100

    
    (a)  If the division finds that a strike has been fomented by a worker of any employer,
            
101

    
none of the workers of the grade, class, or group of workers of the individual who is found to
            
102

    
be a party to the plan, or agreement to foment a strike, shall be eligible for benefits.  However,
            
103

    
if the division finds that the strike is caused by the failure or refusal of any employer to
            
104

    
conform to any law of the state or of the United States pertaining to hours, wages, or other
            
105

    
conditions of work, the strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.
            
106

    
    (b)  If the division finds that the employer, the employer's agent or representative has
            
107

    
conspired, planned, or agreed with any of the employer's workers, their agents or
            
108

    
representatives to foment a strike, that strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.
            
109

    
    (c)  A worker may receive benefits if, subsequent to the worker's unemployment
            
110

    
because of a strike as defined in this Subsection (4), the worker has obtained employment and
            
111

    
has been paid wages of not less than the amount specified in Subsection 

35A-4-401

(4) and has
            
112

    
worked as specified in Subsection  

35A-4-403

(1)(f).  During the existence of the stoppage of
            
113

    
work due to this strike the wages of the worker used for the determination of his benefit rights

            
114


    
may not include any wages the worker earned from the employer involved in the strike.
            
115

    
    (5) (a)  For each week with respect to which the claimant willfully made a false
            
116

    
statement or representation or knowingly failed to report a material fact to obtain any benefit
            
117

    
under the provisions of this chapter, and an additional 13 weeks for the first week the statement
            
118

    
or representation was made or fact withheld and six weeks for each week thereafter; the
            
119

    
additional weeks not to exceed 49 weeks.
            
120

    
    (b)  The additional period shall commence on the Sunday following the issuance of a
            
121

    
determination finding the claimant in violation of this Subsection (5).
            
122

    
    (c) (i)  Each claimant found in violation of this Subsection (5) shall repay to the
            
123

    
division the overpayment and, as a civil penalty, an amount equal to the overpayment.
            
124

    
    (ii)  The overpayment is the amount of benefits the claimant received by direct reason
            
125

    
of fraud.
            
126

    
    (iii)  The penalty amount shall be regarded as any other penalty under this chapter.
            
127

    
    (iv)  These amounts shall be collectible by civil action or warrant in the manner
            
128

    
provided in Subsections 

35A-4-305

(3) and (5).
            
129

    
    (d)  A claimant is ineligible for future benefits or waiting week credit, and any wage
            
130

    
credits earned by the claimant shall be unavailable for purposes of paying benefits, if any
            
131

    
amount owed under this Subsection (5) remains unpaid.
            
132

    
    (e)  Determinations under this Subsection (5) shall be appealable in the manner
            
133

    
provided by this chapter for appeals from other benefit determinations.
            
134

    
    (f)  If the fraud determination is based solely on unreported or [under reported]
            
135

    
underreported work or earnings, or both, and the claimant would have been eligible for benefits
            
136

    
if the work or earnings, or both, had been correctly reported, the individual does not lose
            
137

    
eligibility for that week because of the misreporting but is liable for the overpayment and
            
138

    
subject to the penalties in Subsection (5)(c) and the disqualification periods for future weeks in
            
139

    
Subsection (5)(a).
            
140

    
    (6)  For any week with respect to which or a part of which the claimant has received or
            
141

    
is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state

            
142


    
or the United States.  If the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally
            
143

    
determines that the claimant is not entitled to those unemployment benefits, this
            
144

    
disqualification does not apply.
            
145

    
    (7) (a)  For any week with respect to which the claimant is receiving, has received, or is
            
146

    
entitled to receive remuneration in the form of:
            
147

    
    (i)  wages in lieu of notice, or a dismissal or separation payment; or
            
148

    
    (ii)  accrued vacation or terminal leave payment.
            
149

    
    (b)  If the remuneration is less than the benefits that would otherwise be due, the
            
150

    
claimant is entitled to receive for that week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced as provided
            
151

    
in Subsection 

35A-4-401

(3).
            
152

    
    (8) (a)  For any week in which the individual's benefits are based on service for an
            
153

    
educational institution in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity and
            
154

    
that begins during the period between two successive academic years, or during a similar
            
155

    
period between two regular terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid
            
156

    
sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract if the individual performs services in
            
157

    
the first of those academic years or terms and if there is a contract or reasonable assurance that
            
158

    
the individual will perform services in that capacity for an educational institution in the second
            
159

    
of the academic years or terms.
            
160

    
    (b) (i)  For any week in which the individual's benefits are based on service in any other
            
161

    
capacity for an educational institution, and  that week begins during a period between two
            
162

    
successive academic years or terms if the individual performs those services in the first of the
            
163

    
academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the
            
164

    
services in the second of the academic years or terms.
            
165

    
    (ii)  If compensation is denied to any individual under this Subsection (8) and the
            
166

    
individual was not offered an opportunity to perform the services for the educational institution
            
167

    
for the second of the academic years or terms, the individual shall be entitled to a retroactive
            
168

    
payment of compensation for each week for which the individual filed a timely claim for
            
169

    
compensation and for which compensation was denied solely by reason of this Subsection (8).

            
170


    
    (c)  With respect to any services described in Subsection (8)(a) or (b), compensation
            
171

    
payable on the basis of those services shall be denied to an individual for any week that
            
172

    
commences during an established and customary vacation period or holiday recess if the
            
173

    
individual performs the services in the period immediately before the vacation period or
            
174

    
holiday recess, and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the services
            
175

    
in the period immediately following the vacation period or holiday recess.
            
176

    
    (d) (i)  With respect to services described in Subsection (8)(a) or (b), compensation
            
177

    
payable on the basis of those services as provided in Subsection (8)(a), (b), or (c) shall be
            
178

    
denied to an individual who performed those services in an educational institution while in the
            
179

    
employ of an educational service agency.
            
180

    
    (ii)  For purposes of this Subsection (8)(d), "educational service agency" means a
            
181

    
governmental agency or entity established and operated exclusively for the purpose of
            
182

    
providing the services described in Subsection (8)(a) or (b) to an educational institution.

    (e)  Benefits based on service in employment, defined in Subsections 

35A-4-204

(2)(d)
            
184

    
and (e) are payable in the same amount, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions
            
185

    
as compensation payable on the basis of other service subject to this chapter.
            
186

    
    (9)  For any week that commences during the period between two successive sport
            
187

188

    
consists of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to participate in the
            
189

    
first of those seasons or similar periods and there is a reasonable assurance that individual will
            
190

    
perform those services in the later of the seasons or similar periods.
            
191

    
    (10) (a)  For any week in which the benefits are based upon services performed by an
            
192

    
alien, unless the alien is an individual who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence
            
193

    
at the time the services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing the
            
194

    
services or, was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the
            
195
