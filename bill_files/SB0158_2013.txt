    (1)  Cities are permitted to accumulate retained earnings or fund balances, as
            
28

    (c)  to cover a pending year-end excess of expenditures over revenues from an
            
37

    
unavoidable shortfall in revenues.  This provision does not permit the appropriation of any
            
38

    
fund balance to avoid an operating deficit during any budget period except as provided under
            
39

    
Subsection (4), or for emergency purposes under Section 

10-6-129

.
            
40

    
    (2)  The accumulation of a fund balance in the general fund may not exceed [18%] 25%
            
41

42

    
    (3)  If the fund balance at the close of any fiscal period exceeds the amount permitted
            
43

    
under Subsection (2), the excess shall be appropriated in the manner provided in Section
            
44

    

10-6-117

.
            
45

    
    (4)  Any fund balance in excess of 5% of the total revenues of the general fund may be
            
46

    
utilized for budget purposes.
            
47

    
    (5) (a)  Within a capital improvements fund, the governing body may, in any budget
            
48

    
period, appropriate from estimated revenue or fund balance to a reserve for capital
            
49

    
improvements for the purpose of financing future specific capital improvements, under a
            
50

    
formal long-range capital plan adopted by the governing body.
            
51

    
    (b)  The reserves may accumulate from fiscal period to fiscal period until the
            
52

    
accumulated total is sufficient to permit economical expenditure for the specified purposes.
            
53

    
    (c)  Disbursements from these reserves shall be made only by transfer to a revenue or
            
54

    
transfer account within the capital improvements fund, under a budget appropriation in a
            
55

    
budget for the fund adopted in the manner provided by this chapter.
