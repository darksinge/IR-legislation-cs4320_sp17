 Legislative Review Note
    as of   2-5-04  1:57 PM



This legislation authorizes a State Railroad Museum special group license plate.  This
legislation might be challenged on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has not decided a case addressing
the issuance of special group license plates. However, at least one federal district court has held
that the issuance of a special plate constitutes private speech that is unconstitutional viewpoint
discrimination if the license plate is issued pursuant to the uncontrolled discretion of the
legislature.  Planned Parenthood v. Rose, 236 F. Supp. 2d 564 (D.S.C. 2002);  See also, Sons
of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles,
288 F.3d 610 (4th Cir. 2002).

This legislation also requires a contribution of at least $25 annually to the Ogden Union Station
Foundation, a private non-profit entity, in order to purchase a State Railroad Museum special
group license plate.  Article VI, Section 26 of the Utah Constitution prohibits special
legislation.  The Utah Supreme Court has defined special legislation as legislation that
classifies its objects unreasonably, by selecting from a class of particular persons, places, or
things for the purpose of conferring privileges or imposing burdens. It is unclear whether a
court would determine that requiring a contribution of at least $25 annually to the Ogden Union
Station Foundation, if a person chooses to purchase a State Railroad Museum special group
license plate, is unconstitutional special legislation.  If a court finds that the classification is
reasonable and that general legislation is unable to cover the same issues that the special
legislation covers, a court would likely uphold the Legislature's action.
