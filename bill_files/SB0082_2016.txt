and574          (ii)  complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the575     minor.576          (15)  Any physical custody of the minor by the parent or a relative during the period577     described in Subsections (11) through (14) does not interrupt the running of the period.578          (16) (a)  If reunification services are ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted579     by the court in accordance with Section 78A-6-314 at the expiration of the time period for580     reunification services.581          (b)  The permanency hearing shall be held no later than 12 months after the original582     removal of the minor.583          (c)  If reunification services are not ordered, a permanency hearing shall be conducted584     within 30 days, in accordance with Section 78A-6-314.585          (17)  With regard to a minor in the custody of the division whose parent or parents are586     ordered to receive reunification services but who have abandoned that minor for a period of six587     months from the date that reunification services were ordered:588          (a)  the court shall terminate reunification services;

and594          (b)  in accordance with the best interest of the minor.595          (19) (a)  Because of the state's interest in and responsibility to protect and provide596     permanency for minors who are abused, neglected, or dependent, the Legislature finds that a597     parent's interest in receiving reunification services is limited.598          (b)  The court may determine that:599          (i)  efforts to reunify a minor with the minor's family are not reasonable or appropriate,600     based on the individual circumstances;

or650          (l)  any other circumstance that the court determines should preclude reunification651     efforts or services.652          (21) (a)  The finding under Subsection (20)(b) shall be based on competent evidence653     from at least two medical or mental health professionals, who are not associates, establishing654     that, even with the provision of services, the parent is not likely to be capable of adequately655     caring for the minor within 12 months after the day on which the court finding is made.656          (b)  A judge may disregard the provisions of Subsection (20)(k) if the court finds, under657     the circumstances of the case, that the substance abuse treatment described in Subsection658     (20)(k) is not warranted.659          (22)  In determining whether reunification services are appropriate, the court shall take660     into consideration:661          (a)  failure of the parent to respond to previous services or comply with a previous child662     and family plan;663          (b)  the fact that the minor was abused while the parent was under the influence of664     drugs or alcohol;665          (c)  any history of violent behavior directed at the child or an immediate family666     member;667          (d)  whether a parent continues to live with an individual who abused the minor;668          (e)  any patterns of the parent's behavior that have exposed the minor to repeated abuse;669          (f)  testimony by a competent professional that the parent's behavior is unlikely to be670     successful;

and743          (c)  establish a concurrent permanency plan that identifies the second most appropriate744     final plan for the minor, if appropriate.745          [(5)  If the Division of Child and Family Services documents to the court that there is a746     compelling reason that adoption, reunification, guardianship, and a placement described in747     Subsection 78A-6-306(6)(e) are not in the minor's best interest, the court may order another748     planned permanent living arrangement, in accordance with federal law.]749          [(6) If the minor clearly desires contact with the parent, the court shall take the minor's750     desire into consideration in determining the final plan.]751          (5)  The court may order another planned permanent living arrangement for a minor 16752     years old or older upon entering the following findings:753          (a)  the Division of Child and Family Services has documented intensive, ongoing, and754     unsuccessful efforts to reunify the minor with the minor's parent or parents, or to secure a755     placement for the minor with a guardian, an adoptive parent, or an individual described in756     Subsection 78A-6-306(6)(e);757          (b)  the Division of Child and Family Services has demonstrated that the division has758     made efforts to normalize the life of the minor while in the division's custody, in accordance759     with Sections 62A-4a-210 through 62A-4a-212;760          (c)  the minor prefers another planned permanent living arrangement; and761          (d)  there is a compelling reason why reunification or a placement described in762     Subsection (5)(a) is not in the minor's best interest.763          [(7)] (6)  Except as provided in Subsection [(8)] (7), the court may not extend764     reunification services beyond 12 months after the day on which the minor was initially765     removed from the minor's home, in accordance with the provisions of Section 78A-6-312.766          [(8)] (7) (a)  Subject to Subsection [(8)] (7)(b), the court may extend reunification767     services for no more than 90 days if the court finds, beyond a preponderance of the evidence,768     that:769          (i)  there has been substantial compliance with the child and family plan;770          (ii)  reunification is probable within that 90-day period;
