Under Subsection      b , emotional disturbance does not include a condition resulting                          from mental illness as defined in Section                 .

Special mitigation reducing the level of criminal homicide offense                                 Standard of proof    Application to reduce offense.                                    a   Special mitigation exists when the defendant causes the death of another under the                          influence of extreme emotional distress for which there is a reasonable explanation or excuse.                                b   The reasonableness of an explanation or excuse under Subsection     a  is determined                          from the objective viewpoint of a reasonable person under the circumstances existing at the time                          of the offense.                                c   Emotional distress under Subsection     a  does not include                                 i   a condition resulting from mental illness as defined in Section                   or                                ii   distress that is substantially caused by the defendant s own conduct.                                    a   Special mitigation exists when the defendant causes the death of another and the                          defendant reasonably believes the existing circumstances at the time of the offense provide a legal                          justification or excuse for his conduct, although the conduct is not legally justifiable or excusable                          under the existing circumstances.                                b   The reasonable belief of the defendant under Subsection     a  is determined from the                          objective viewpoint of a reasonable person under the circumstances existing at the time of the                          offense.                                    a   If the issue of special mitigation is submitted to the trier of fact, it shall return a                          special verdict indicating whether the existence of special mitigation has been found.                                b   The trier of fact shall return the special verdict at the same time as the general verdict.                                    a   If the trier of fact finds the elements of an offense as listed in Subsection     b  are                          proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and also that the existence of special mitigation under this                          section is established by a preponderance of the evidence, it shall return a verdict on the reduced                          charge as provided in Subsection     b .                                b   If under Subsection     a  the offense is                                 i   aggravated murder, the defendant shall instead be found guilty of murder                                 ii   attempted aggravated murder, the defendant shall instead be found guilty of attempted                          murder                                 iii   murder, the defendant shall instead be found guilty of manslaughter  or                                iv   attempted murder, the defendant shall instead be found guilty of attempted                          manslaughter.                                    a   If a jury is the trier of fact, a unanimous vote of the jury is required to establish the                             existence of the special mitigation.                                b   If the jury does find special mitigation by a unanimous vote, it shall return a verdict                          on the reduced charge as provided in Subsection    .                                c   If the jury finds by a unanimous vote that special mitigation has not been established,                          it shall convict the defendant of the greater offense for which the prosecution has established all                          the elements beyond a reasonable doubt.                                d   If the jury is unable to unanimously agree whether or not special mitigation has been                          established, the result is a hung jury.                                    Special mitigation under this section does not in any case reduce the level of an offense                          by more than one degree from that offense, the elements of which the evidence has established                           beyond a reasonable doubt.
