safety of the public;
            
218

    
    (b)  if the committee determines that state licensing of the profession is not necessary

compelling interest in protecting and maintaining the health or safety of the public; and
            
225

    
    (d)  recommend to the Legislature any necessary changes to the proposed or existing

    (c)  whether [or not] the public needs, and can reasonably be expected to benefit from,
            
235

    
an assurance of initial and continuing occupational or professional competence;
            
236
