42

    
    (1) (a)  For the week in which the claimant left work voluntarily without good cause, if
            
43

    
so found by the division, and for each week thereafter until the claimant has performed services
            
44

    
in bona fide, covered employment and earned wages for those services equal to at least six
            
45

    
times the claimant's weekly benefit amount.
            
46

    
    (b)  A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits if the claimant leaves work
            
47

    
under circumstances where it would be contrary to equity and good conscience to impose a
            
48

    
disqualification.
            
49

    
    (c)  Using available information from employers and the claimant, the division shall
            
50

    
consider for the purposes of this chapter the reasonableness of the claimant's actions, and the
            
51

    
extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing attachment to the labor market in
            
52

    
reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a claimant is contrary to equity and
            
53

    
good conscience.
            
54

    
    (d) Except as provided in Subsection (1)(e), a claimant who has left work voluntarily to

57

    
    (e)  A claimant who has left work voluntarily to accompany or follow the claimant's
            
58

    
spouse to a new locality does so with good cause for purposes of this Subsection (1) and is

            
59


    
eligible to receive benefits if:
            
60

    
    (i)  the claimant's spouse is a member of the United States armed forces and the

65

    
    (ii)  it is impractical as determined by the division for the claimant to commute to the
            
66

    
previous work from the new locality;
            
67

    
    (iii)  the claimant left work voluntarily no earlier than 15 days before the scheduled start
            
68

    
date of the spouse's active-duty assignment; and
            
69

    
    (iv)  the claimant otherwise meets and follows the eligibility and reporting requirements
            
70

    
of this chapter, including registering for work with the division or, if the claimant has relocated
            
71

    
to another state, the equivalent agency of that state.
            
72

    
    (2) (a)  For the week in which the claimant was discharged for just cause or for an act or
            
73

    
omission in connection with employment, not constituting a crime, which is deliberate, willful,
            
74

    
or wanton and adverse to the employer's rightful interest, if so found by the division, and
            
75

    
thereafter until the claimant has earned an amount equal to at least six times the claimant's
            
76

    
weekly benefit amount in bona fide covered employment.
            
77

    
    (b)  For the week in which the claimant was discharged for dishonesty constituting a
            
78

    
crime or any felony or class A misdemeanor in connection with the claimant's work as shown
            
79

    
by the facts, together with the claimant's admission, or as shown by the claimant's conviction of
            
80

    
that crime in a court of competent jurisdiction and for the 51 next following weeks.
            
81

    
    (c)  Wage credits shall be deleted from the claimant's base period, and are not available
            
82

    
for this or any subsequent claim for benefits.
            
83

    
    (3) (a) (i)  If the division finds that the claimant has failed without good cause to
            
84

    
properly apply for available suitable work, to accept a referral to suitable work offered by the
            
85

    
employment office, or to accept suitable work offered by an employer or the employment
            
86

    
office.
            
87

    
    (ii)  The ineligibility continues until the claimant has performed services in bona fide
            
88

    
covered employment and earned wages for the services in an amount equal to at least six times
            
89

    
the claimant's weekly benefit amount.

            
90


    
    (b) (i)  A claimant may not be denied eligibility for benefits for failure to apply, accept
            
91

    
referral, or accept available suitable work under circumstances where it would be contrary to
            
92

    
equity and good conscience to impose a disqualification.
            
93

    
    (ii)  The division shall consider the purposes of this chapter, the reasonableness of the
            
94

    
claimant's actions, and the extent to which the actions evidence a genuine continuing
            
95

    
attachment to the labor market in reaching a determination of whether the ineligibility of a
            
96

    
claimant is contrary to equity and good conscience.
            
97

    
    (c)  In determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the division shall
            
98

    
consider the:
            
99

    
    (i)  degree of risk involved to [his] the individual's health, safety, and morals;
            
100

    
    (ii)  individual's physical fitness and prior training;
            
101

    
    (iii)  individual's prior earnings and experience;
            
102

    
    (iv)  individual's length of unemployment;
            
103

    
    (v)  prospects for securing local work in [his] the individual's customary occupation;
            
104

    
    (vi)  wages for similar work in the locality; and
            
105

    
    (vii)  distance of the available work from [his] the individual's residence.
            
106

    
    (d)  Prior earnings shall be considered on the basis of all four quarters used in
            
107

    
establishing eligibility and not just the earnings from the most recent employer.  The division
            
108

    
shall be more prone to find work as suitable the longer the claimant has been unemployed and
            
109

    
the less likely the prospects are to secure local work in his customary occupation.
            
110

    
    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no work is suitable, and
            
111

    
benefits may not be denied under this chapter to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing
            
112

    
to accept new work under any of the following conditions:
            
113

    
    (i)  if the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike, lockout, or other labor
            
114

    
dispute;
            
115

    
    (ii)  if the wages, hours, or other conditions of the work offered are substantially less
            
116

    
favorable to the individual than those prevailing for similar work in the locality; or
            
117

    
    (iii)  if as a condition of being employed the individual would be required to join a
            
118

    
company union or to resign from or refrain from joining any bona fide labor organization.
            
119

    
    (4)  For any week in which the division finds that the claimant's unemployment is due
            
120

    
to a stoppage of work that exists because of a strike involving the claimant's grade, class, or

            
121


    
group of workers at the factory or establishment at which the claimant is or was last employed.
            
122

    
    (a)  If the division finds that a strike has been fomented by a worker of any employer,
            
123

    
none of the workers of the grade, class, or group of workers of the individual who is found to
            
124

    
be a party to the plan, or agreement to foment a strike, shall be eligible for benefits.  However,
            
125

    
if the division finds that the strike is caused by the failure or refusal of any employer to
            
126

    
conform to any law of the state or of the United States pertaining to hours, wages, or other
            
127

    
conditions of work, the strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.
            
128

    
    (b)  If the division finds that the employer, the employer's agent or representative has
            
129

    
conspired, planned, or agreed with any of the employer's workers, their agents or
            
130

    
representatives to foment a strike, that strike may not render the workers ineligible for benefits.
            
131

    
    (c)  A worker may receive benefits if, subsequent to the worker's unemployment
            
132

    
because of a strike as defined in this Subsection (4), the worker has obtained employment and
            
133

    
has been paid wages of not less than the amount specified in Subsection 

35A-4-401

(4) and has
            
134

    
worked as specified in Subsection 

35A-4-403

(1)(f).  During the existence of the stoppage of
            
135

    
work due to this strike the wages of the worker used for the determination of his benefit rights
            
136

    
may not include any wages the worker earned from the employer involved in the strike.
            
137

    
    (5) (a)  For each week [with respect to which the claimant willfully made a false
            
138

    
statement or representation or knowingly failed to report a material fact to obtain any  benefit
            
139

    
under the provisions of this chapter, and an additional  13 weeks for the first week the
            
140

    
statement or representation was made or fact withheld and six weeks for each  week thereafter;
            
141

    
the additional weeks not to exceed 49 weeks.] a claimant obtains a benefit under this chapter by
            
142

    
willfully making a false statement or representation or by knowingly failing to report a material
            
143

    
fact, and a penalty of no more than 49 additional weeks as follows:
            
144

    
    (i)  13 weeks for the first week the false statement or representation was made or fact
            
145

    
withheld to receive a benefit; and
            
146

    
    (ii)  six weeks for each additional week the false statement or representation was made
            
147

    
or fact withheld to receive a benefit.
            
148

    
    (b)  The additional [period] penalty weeks shall [commence] begin on the Sunday
            
149

    
[following the issuance of a] of the week the determination finding the claimant in violation of
            
150

    
this Subsection (5) is issued.
            
151

    
    (c) (i)  Each claimant found in violation of this Subsection (5) shall repay to the

            
152


    
division the overpayment and, as a civil penalty for fraud, an amount equal to the overpayment.
            
153

    
    (ii)  The overpayment is the amount of benefits the claimant received by direct reason
            
154

    
of fraud.
            
155

    
    (iii)  [The] Subject to the requirements of Subsection 

35A-4-506

(7), the civil penalty
            
156

    
for fraud amount shall be [regarded] treated as any other penalty under this chapter.
            
157

    
    (iv)  [These amounts] The repayment of an overpayment and a civil penalty for fraud
            
158

    
shall be collectible by civil action or warrant in the manner provided in Subsections
            
159

    

35A-4-305

(3) and (5).
            
160

    
    (d)  A claimant is ineligible for future benefits or waiting week credit, and any wage
            
161

    
credits earned by the claimant shall be unavailable for purposes of paying benefits, if any
            
162

    
amount owed under this Subsection (5) remains unpaid.
            
163

    
    (e)  Determinations under this Subsection (5) shall be appealable in the manner
            
164

    
provided by this chapter for appeals from other benefit determinations.
            
165

    
    (f)  If the fraud determination is based solely on unreported or underreported work or
            
166

    
earnings, or both, and the claimant would have been eligible for benefits if the work or
            
167

    
earnings, or both, had been correctly reported, the individual does not lose eligibility for that
            
168

    
week because of the misreporting but is liable for the overpayment and subject to the penalties
            
169

    
in Subsection (5)(c) and the disqualification periods for future weeks in Subsection (5)(a).
            
170

171

    
is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state
            
172

    
or the United States.  If the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally
            
173

    
determines that the claimant is not entitled to those unemployment benefits, this
            
174

    
disqualification does not apply.
            
175

    
    (7) (a)  For any week with respect to which the claimant is receiving, has received, or is
            
176

    
entitled to receive remuneration in the form of:
            
177

    
    (i)  wages in lieu of notice, or a dismissal or separation payment; or
            
178

    
    (ii)  accrued vacation or terminal leave payment.
            
179

    
    (b)  If the remuneration is less than the benefits that would otherwise be due, the
            
180

    
claimant is entitled to receive for that week, if otherwise eligible, benefits reduced as provided
            
181

    
in Subsection 

35A-4-401

(3).
            
182

    
    (8) (a)  For any week in which the individual's benefits are based on service for an

            
183


    
educational institution in an instructional, research, or principal administrative capacity and
            
184

    
that begins during the period between two successive academic years, or during a similar
            
185

    
period between two regular terms, whether or not successive, or during a period of paid
            
186

    
sabbatical leave provided for in the individual's contract if the individual performs services in
            
187

    
the first of those academic years or terms and if there is a contract or reasonable assurance that
            
188

    
the individual will perform services in that capacity for an educational institution in the second
            
189

    
of the academic years or terms.
