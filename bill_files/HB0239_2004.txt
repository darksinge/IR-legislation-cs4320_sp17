 Legislative Review Note
    as of  12-22-03  8:36 AM

This bill imposes a tax on sexually explicit businesses and escort services, and might be
challenged as violating the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The U.S.
Supreme Court has not decided a case addressing taxation of sexually explicit businesses or
escort services, but has decided cases involving a tax on other activities protected by the First
Amendment. Under those rulings, if this bill were challenged, a court would first determine
whether sexually explicit businesses and escort services are obscene, and not protected by the
First Amendment. If a court decides they are not obscene, and are therefore protected by the
First Amendment, the court could uphold the bill if the court determined that the tax is
necessary to serve a compelling state interest, and is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.
