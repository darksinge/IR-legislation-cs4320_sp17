45

    
competency pursuant to Section 

77-15-4

, the court in which proceedings are pending shall stay
            
46

    
all proceedings.  If the proceedings are in a court other than the district court in which the

48

    
    (b)  The district court in which the petition is filed [shall pass upon the sufficiency of]:

50

    
party, the court shall, prior to granting or denying the petition, hold a limited hearing solely for
            
51

    
the purpose of determining the sufficiency of the petition.  If the court finds that the allegations
            
52

    
of incompetency raise a bona fide doubt as to the defendant's competency to stand trial, it shall
            
53

    
enter an order for a hearing on the mental condition of the person who is the subject of the
            
54

    
petition.];
            
55

    
    (ii)  may hold a limited hearing solely for the purpose of determining the sufficiency of
            
56

    
the petition if the court finds the petition is not clearly sufficient on its face;
            
57

    
    (iii)  shall hold a hearing if the petition is opposed by either party;
            
58

    
    (iv)  may not order an examination of the defendant or order a hearing on the mental

            
59


    
condition of the defendant unless the court finds that the allegations in the petition raise a bona
            
60

    
fide doubt as to the defendant's competency to stand trial; and
            
61

    
    (v)  shall order an examination of the defendant and a hearing on the defendant's mental
            
62

    
condition if the court finds that the allegations raise a bona fide doubt as to the defendant's

65

    
may order the Department of Human Services to examine the person and to report to the court
            
66

    
concerning the defendant's mental condition.
            
67

    
    (b)  The defendant shall be examined by at least two mental health experts not involved
            
68

    
in the current treatment of the defendant.
            
69

    
    (c)  If the issue is sufficiently raised in the petition or if it becomes apparent that the
            
70

    
defendant may be incompetent due to mental retardation, at least one expert experienced in
            
71

    
mental retardation assessment shall evaluate the defendant.  Upon appointment of the experts,
            
72

    
the petitioner or other party as directed by the court shall provide information and materials to
            
73

    
the examiners relevant to a determination of the defendant's competency and shall provide

    (d)  The prosecuting and defense attorneys shall cooperate in providing the relevant
            
77

81

    
consent of the defendant or further order of the court.
            
82

    
    (3)  During the examination under Subsection (2), unless the court or the executive

    (i)  comprehend and appreciate the charges or allegations against [him] the defendant;
            
89

    
    (ii)  disclose to counsel pertinent facts, events, and states of mind;

quality of the defendant's relationship with counsel;
            
98

    
    (c)  if psychoactive medication is currently being administered:
            
99

    
    (i)  whether the medication is necessary to maintain the defendant's competency; and
            
100

    
    (ii)  the effect of the medication, if any, on the defendant's demeanor and affect and
            
101

    
ability to participate in the proceedings[.]; and
            
102

    
    (d)  whether the defendant is exhibiting false or exaggerated physical or psychological
            
103

    
symptoms relevant to the defendant's capacity to stand trial.
            
104

    
    (5)  If the expert's opinion is that the defendant is incompetent to proceed, the expert
            
105

    
shall indicate in the report:
            
106

    
    (a)  which of the above factors contributes to the defendant's incompetency;

    (c)  the treatment or treatments appropriate and available; [and]
            
110

112

psychological symptoms relevant to the defendant's capacity to stand trial and the expert's
            
115

    
opinion as to the significance of any false or exaggerated symptoms regarding the defendant's
            
116

    
capacity.
            
117

    
    (6)  The experts examining the defendant shall provide an initial report to the court and
            
118

    
the prosecuting and defense attorneys within 30 days of the receipt of the court's order.  The
            
119

    
report shall inform the court of the examiner's opinion concerning the competency of the
            
120

    
defendant to stand trial, or, in the alternative, the examiner may inform the court in writing that

            
121


    
additional time is needed to complete the report.  If the examiner informs the court that
            
122

    
additional time is needed, the examiner shall have up to an additional 30 days to provide the
            
123

    
report to the court and counsel.  The examiner [must] shall provide the report within 60 days
            
124

125

    
additional period of time to complete the examination and provide the report.
            
126

    
    (7)  Any written report submitted by the experts shall:
            
127

    
    (a)  identify the specific matters referred for evaluation;
            
128

    
    (b)  describe the procedures, techniques, and tests used in the examination and the
            
129

    
purpose or purposes for each;
            
130

    
    (c)  state the expert's clinical observations, findings, and opinions on each issue referred
            
131

    
for examination by the court, and indicate specifically those issues, if any, on which the expert
            
132

    
could not give an opinion; and
            
133

    
    (d)  identify the sources of information used by the expert and present the basis for the
            
134

    
expert's clinical findings and opinions.
            
135

    
    (8) (a)  Any statement made by the defendant in the course of any competency
            
136

    
examination, whether the examination is with or without the consent of the defendant, any
            
137

    
testimony by the expert based upon [such] the statement, and any other fruits of the statement
            
138

    
may not be admitted in evidence against the defendant in any criminal proceeding except on an
            
139

    
issue respecting mental condition on which the defendant has introduced evidence.  The
            
140

    
evidence may be admitted, however, where relevant to a determination of the defendant's
            
141

    
competency.
            
142

    
    (b)  Prior to examining the defendant, examiners should specifically advise the
            
143

    
defendant of the limits of confidentiality as provided under Subsection (8)(a).
            
144

    
    (9) (a)  When the report is received the court shall set a date for a mental hearing
            
145

    
[which].  The hearing shall be held in not less than five and not more than 15 days, unless the
            
146

    
court enlarges the time for good cause.
            
147

    
    (b)  Any person or organization directed by the department to conduct the examination
            
148

    
may be subpoenaed to testify at the hearing.  If the experts are in conflict as to the competency
            
149

    
of the defendant, all experts should be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably available.  A
            
150

    
conflict in the opinions of the experts does not require the appointment of an additional expert
            
151

    
unless the court determines the appointment to be necessary.

            
152


    
    (c)  The court may call any examiner to testify at the hearing who is not called by the
            
153

    
parties.  If the court calls an examiner, counsel for the parties may cross-examine the expert.
            
154

    
    (10) (a)  A person shall be presumed competent unless the court, by a preponderance of
            
155

    
the evidence, finds the person incompetent to proceed.  The burden of proof is upon the
            
156

    
proponent of incompetency at the hearing.
            
157

    
    (b)  An adjudication of incompetency to proceed [shall] does not operate as an
            
158

    
adjudication of incompetency to give informed consent for medical treatment or for any other
            
159

    
purpose, unless specifically set forth in the court order.
            
160

    
    (11) (a)  If the court finds the defendant incompetent to stand trial, its order shall
            
161

    
contain findings addressing each of the factors in Subsections (4)(a) and (b) [of this section]. 
            
162

    
The order issued pursuant to Subsection 

77-15-6

(1) which the court sends to the facility where
            
163

    
the defendant is committed or to the person who is responsible for assessing [his] the
            
164

    
defendant's progress toward competency shall be provided contemporaneously with the
            
165

    
transportation and commitment order of the defendant, unless exigent circumstances require
            
166

    
earlier commitment in which case the court shall forward the order within five working days of
            
167

    
the order of transportation and commitment of the defendant.
            
168

    
    (b)  The order finding the defendant incompetent to stand trial shall be accompanied by:
            
169

    
    (i)  copies of the reports of the experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of
            
170

    
examination if not provided previously;
            
171

    
    (ii)  copies of any of the psychiatric, psychological, or social work reports submitted to
            
172

    
the court relative to the mental condition of the defendant; and
            
173

    
    (iii)  any other documents made available to the court by either the defense or the
            
174

    
prosecution, pertaining to the defendant's current or past mental condition.
            
175

    
    (12)  If the court finds it necessary to order the defendant transported prior to the
            
176

    
completion of findings and compilation of documents required under Subsection (11), the
            
177

    
transportation and commitment order delivering the defendant to the Utah State Hospital, or
            
178

    
other mental health facility as directed by the executive director of the Department of Human
            
179

    
Services or [his] a designee, shall indicate that the defendant's commitment is based upon a
            
180

    
finding of incompetency, and the mental health facility's copy of the order shall be
            
181

    
accompanied by the reports of any experts filed with the court pursuant to the order of
            
182

    
examination.  The executive director of the Department of Human Services or [his] a designee

            
183


    
may refuse to accept a defendant as a patient unless [he] the defendant is accompanied by a
            
184

    
transportation and commitment order which is accompanied by the reports.
            
185

    
    (13)  Upon a finding of incompetency to stand trial by the court, the prosecuting and
            
186

    
defense attorneys shall provide information and materials relevant to the defendant's
            
187

    Section 2.  
Section  
77-15-6

 is amended to read:
            
199

    
     77-15-6.  Commitment on finding of incompetency to stand trial -- Subsequent
            
200

    
 hearings -- Notice to prosecuting attorneys.
            
201

    
    (1)  Except as provided in Subsection (5), if after hearing, the [person] defendant is
            
202

    
found to be incompetent to stand trial, the court shall order the defendant committed to the
            
203

    
custody of the executive director of the Department of Human Services or [his] a designee for
            
204

    
the purpose of treatment intended to restore the defendant to competency.  The court may
            
205

    
recommend but not order placement of the defendant.  The court may, however, order that the
            
206

    
defendant be placed in a secure setting rather than a nonsecure setting.  The director or [his] a
            
207

    
designee shall designate the specific placement of the defendant during the period of evaluation
            
208

    
and treatment to restore competency.
            
209

    
    (2)  The examiner or examiners designated by the executive director to assess the
            
210

    
defendant's progress toward competency may not be involved in the routine treatment of the
            
211

    
defendant.  The examiner or examiners shall provide a full report to the court and prosecuting
            
212

    
and defense attorneys within 90 days of arrival of the defendant at the treating facility.  If any
            
213

    
examiner is unable to complete the assessment within 90 days, that examiner shall provide to

            
214


    
the court and counsel a summary progress report which informs the court that additional time is
            
215

    
necessary to complete the assessment, in which case the examiner shall have up to an
            
216

    
additional 90 days to provide the full report.  The full report shall assess:
            
217

    
    (a)  whether the defendant is exhibiting false or exaggerated physical or psychological
            
218

    
symptoms, and shall report:
            
219

    
    (i)  any diagnostic instruments, methods, and observations used by the examiner to
            
220

    
make the determination; and
            
221

    
    (ii)  the examiner's opinion as to the effect of any false or exaggerated symptoms on the
            
222

    
defendant's capacity to stand trial;
            
223

    
    [(a)] (b)  the facility's or program's capacity to provide appropriate treatment for the
            
224

    
defendant;
            
225

    
    [(b)] (c)  the nature of treatments provided to the defendant;
            
226

    
    [(c)] (d)  what progress toward competency restoration has been made with respect to
            
227

    
the factors identified by the court in its initial order;
            
228

    
    [(d)] (e)  the defendant's current level of mental disorder or mental retardation and need
            
229

    
for treatment, if any; and
            
230

    
    [(e)] (f)  the likelihood of restoration of competency and the amount of time estimated
            
231

    
to achieve it.
            
232

    
    (3)  The court on its own motion or upon motion by either party or by the executive
            
233

    
director may appoint additional mental health examiners to examine the defendant and advise
            
234

    
the court on [his] the defendant's current mental status and progress toward competency
            
235

    
restoration.
            
236

    
    (4)  Upon receipt of the full report, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the
            
237

    
defendant's current status.  At the hearing, the burden of proving that the defendant is
            
238

    
competent is on the proponent of competency.  Following the hearing, the court shall determine
            
239

    
by a preponderance of evidence whether the defendant is:
            
240

    
    (a)  competent to stand trial;
            
241

    
    (b)  incompetent to stand trial with a substantial probability that the defendant may
            
242

    
become competent in the foreseeable future; or
            
243

    
    (c)  incompetent to stand trial without a substantial probability that the defendant may
            
244

    
become competent in the foreseeable future.

            
245


    
    (5) (a)  If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection (4)(a), the court shall
            
246

    
proceed with the trial or [such] other procedures as may be necessary to adjudicate the charges.
            
247

    
    (b)  If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection (4)(b), the court may order that
            
248

    
the defendant remain committed to the custody of the executive director of the Department of
            
249

    
Human Services or [his] a designee for the purpose of treatment intended to restore the
            
250

    
defendant to competency.
            
251

    
    (c)  If the court enters a finding pursuant to Subsection (4)(c), the court shall order the
            
252

    
defendant released from the custody of the director unless the prosecutor informs the court that
            
253

    
commitment proceedings pursuant to Title 62A, Chapter 5, Services [to] for People with
            
254

    
Disabilities, or Title 62A, Chapter 15, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Act, will be
            
255

    
initiated.  These commitment proceedings must be initiated within seven days after the court's
            
256

    
order entering the finding in Subsection (4)(c), unless the court enlarges the time for good
            
257

    
cause shown.  The defendant may be ordered to remain in the custody of the director until
            
258

    
commitment proceedings have been concluded.  If the defendant is committed, the court which
            
259

    
entered the order pursuant to Subsection (4)(c), shall be notified by the director at least 10 days
            
260

    
prior to any release of the committed person.
            
261

    
    (6)  If the defendant is recommitted to the department pursuant to Subsection (5)(b), the
            
262

    
court shall hold a hearing one year following the recommitment.
            
263

    
    (7)  At the hearing held pursuant to Subsection (6), except for defendants charged with
            
264

    
the crimes listed in Subsection (8), a defendant who has not been restored to competency shall
            
265

    
be ordered released or temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under the
            
266

    
same terms as provided in Subsection (5)(c).
            
267

    
    (8)  If the defendant has been charged with aggravated murder, murder, attempted
            
268

    
murder, manslaughter, or a first degree felony and the court determines that the defendant is
            
269

    
making reasonable progress towards restoration of competency at the time of the hearing held
            
270

    
pursuant to Subsection (6), the court may order the defendant recommitted for a period not to
            
271

    
exceed 18 months for the purpose of treatment to restore the defendant to competency with a
            
272

    
mandatory review hearing at the end of the 18-month period.
            
273

    
    (9)  Except for defendants charged with aggravated murder or murder, a defendant who
            
274

    
has not been restored to competency at the time of the hearing held pursuant to Subsection (8)
            
275

    
shall be ordered released or temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under

            
276


    
the same terms as provided in Subsection (5)(c).
            
277

    
    (10)  If the defendant has been charged with aggravated murder or murder and the court
            
278

    
determines that [he] the defendant is making reasonable progress towards restoration of
            
279

    
competency at the time of the mandatory review hearing held pursuant to Subsection (8), the
            
280

    
court may order the defendant recommitted for a period not to exceed 36 months for the
            
281

    
purpose of treatment to restore [him to] competency.
            
282

    
    (11)  If the defendant is recommitted to the department pursuant to Subsection (10), the
            
283

    
court shall hold a hearing no later than at 18-month intervals following the recommitment for
            
284

    
the purpose of determining the defendant's competency status.
            
285

    
    (12)  A defendant who has not been restored to competency at the expiration of the
            
286

    
additional 36-month commitment period ordered pursuant to Subsection (10) shall be ordered
            
287

    
released or temporarily detained pending civil commitment proceedings under the same terms
            
288

    
as provided in Subsection (5)(c).
            
289

    
    (13) (a)  In no event may the maximum period of detention under this section exceed
            
290

    
the maximum period of incarceration which the defendant could receive if [he] the defendant
            
291

    
were convicted of the charged offense.
            
292

    
    (b)  This Subsection (13) does not preclude pursuing involuntary civil commitment nor
            
293

    
does it place any time limit on civil commitments.
            
294

    
    (14)  Neither release from a pretrial incompetency commitment under the provisions of
            
295

    
this section nor civil commitment requires dismissal of criminal charges.  The court may retain
            
296

    
jurisdiction over the criminal case and may order periodic reviews to assess the defendant's
            
297

    
competency to stand trial.
            
298

    
    (15)  A defendant who is civilly committed pursuant to Title 62A, Chapter 5, Services
            
299

    
[to] for People with Disabilities, or Title 62A, Chapter 15, Substance Abuse and Mental Health
            
300

    
Act, may still be adjudicated competent to stand trial under this chapter.
            
301

    
    (16) (a)  The remedy for a violation of the time periods specified in this section, other
            
302

    
than those specified in Subsection (5)(c), (7), (9), (12), or (13), shall be a motion to compel the
            
303

    
hearing, or mandamus, but not release from detention or dismissal of the criminal charges.
            
304

    
    (b)  The remedy for a violation of the time periods specified in Subsection (5)(c), (7),
            
305

    
(9), (12), or (13) [shall] is not [be] dismissal of the criminal charges.
            
306

    
    (17)  In cases in which the treatment of the defendant is precluded by court order for a

            
307


    
period of time, that time period may not be considered in computing time limitations under this
            
308

    
section.
            
309

    
    (18)  At any time that the defendant becomes competent to stand trial, the clinical
            
310

    
director of the hospital or other facility or the executive director of the Department of Human
            
311

    
Services shall certify that fact to the court.  The court shall conduct a hearing within 15
            
312

    
working days of the receipt of the clinical director's or executive director's report, unless the
            
313

    
court enlarges the time for good cause.
            
314

    
    (19)  The court may order a hearing or rehearing at any time on its own motion or upon
            
315

    
recommendations of the clinical director of the hospital or other facility or the executive
            
316

    
director of the Department of Human Services.
            
317

    
    (20)  Notice of a hearing on competency to stand trial shall be given to the prosecuting
            
318

    
attorney.  If the hearing is held in the county where the defendant is confined, notice shall also
