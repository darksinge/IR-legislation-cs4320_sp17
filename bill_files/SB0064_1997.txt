    financial responsibility for all or a portion of child care expenses incurred on behalf of the dependent

    children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.  If the court determines

- 12 -


    that the circumstances are appropriate and that the dependent children would be adequately cared

    for, it may include an order allowing the noncustodial parent to provide child care for the dependent

    children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.

        (3)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for the

    custody of the children and their support, maintenance, health, and dental care, and for distribution

    of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary.

    immediate family, the court shall consider the best interest of the child.

    made and denied, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees expended

    by the prevailing party in that action, if the court determines that the petition was without merit and

    not asserted or defended against in good faith.

        (6)  If a petition alleges substantial noncompliance with a visitation order by a parent, a

    grandparent, or other member of the immediate family pursuant to Section 78-32-12.2 where a

    visitation right has been previously granted by the court, the court may award to the prevailing party

    costs, including actual attorney fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing party because of the

        (c)  As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at the time of

- 13 -


    separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection (a).  However, the court shall

    consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion, base alimony on the

    standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short duration, when no children

    have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider the standard of living that

    existed at the time of the marriage.

        (d)  The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the parties'

    respective standards of living.

        (e)  When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major change in the

    income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change shall be considered

    in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony.  If one spouse's earning

    capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses during the marriage, the court

    may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital property and awarding alimony.

        (f)  In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no children have

    been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring each party to the

    condition which existed at the time of the marriage.

        (g) (i)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new orders

    regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not [forseeable]

    foreseeable at the time of the divorce.

        (ii)  The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address needs of

    the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court finds extenuating

    circumstances that justify that action.

        (iii)  In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not be

    considered, except as provided in this subsection.

        (A)  The court may consider the subsequent spouse's financial ability to share living

    expenses.

        (B)  The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that the

    payor's improper conduct justifies that consideration.

        (h)  Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years that the

- 14 -


    marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony,  the court finds extenuating

    circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.

        (8)  Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court that

    a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage of that former

    spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void  ab initio, payment of alimony

    shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the action of annulment and his rights

    are determined.

        (9)  Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates upon

    establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with another

    person.

    for withholding income as a means of collecting child support as provided in Title 62A, Chapter 11,

    [Part 4, Income Withholding] Recovery Services.

        Section 6.  Section  30-3-10.6 is amended to read:

    as defined by [Subsection] Section 62A-11-401[(3)], is, on and after the date it is due:

        (a)  a judgment with the same attributes and effect of any judgment of a district court, except

    as provided in Subsection (2);

        (b)  entitled, as a judgment, to full faith and credit in this and in any other jurisdiction; and

        (c)  not subject to retroactive modification by this or any other jurisdiction, except as

        (2)  A child or spousal support payment under a child support order may be modified with

    respect to any period during which a petition for modification is pending, but only from the date

    or forfeiture which is due and related to a warrant which is outstanding on or after February 16,

        (2) (a)  Subsection (1)[(c)] (b)(ii) may be exercised only if the Office of Recovery Services

        (b)  The court receiving the overpayment applied as bail shall order withdrawal of the warrant

    for arrest of the taxpayer if the case is one for which a personal appearance of the taxpayer is not

    required and if the dollar amount of the overpayment represents the full dollar amount of bail.  In

    all other cases, the court receiving the overpayment applied as bail is not required to order the

    withdrawal of the warrant of arrest of the taxpayer during the 40-day period, and the taxpayer may

        (6)  Any balance shall be refunded immediately to the taxpayer.

        (7) (a)  If a refund or credit is due because the amount of tax deducted and withheld from

        (i)  within three years from the due date of the return, plus the period of any extension of time

    for filing the return; or

    return was due for the taxable year of the loss.

        (11)  If there has been an overpayment of the tax which is required to be deducted and

    withheld under Section 59-10-402, a refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the

- 29 -


    amount of overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.

        (12)  If there is no tax liability for a period in which an amount is paid as income tax, the

    amount is an overpayment.

        (13)  If an income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the applicable period of

    limitation, that amount is an overpayment.

        (14) (a)  If a taxpayer is required to report a change or correction in federal taxable income

    reported on his federal income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is treated in the

    same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal income tax purposes, or to file an amended

    return with the commission, a claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall

    of this chapter, a refund or credit shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the amount

    of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld from wages under the provisions of this chapter.

    make payment to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the taxpayer's estate.  If there is

    occurred, or a petition to modify an order under Subsection 78-45-7.2(6) has been filed, the court

    determining the amount of prospective support shall require each party to file a proposed award of

    child support using the guidelines before an order awarding child support or modifying an existing

    award may be granted.

        (3)  If the court finds sufficient evidence to rebut the guidelines, the court shall establish

    support after considering all relevant factors, including but not limited to:

        (a)  the standard of living and situation of the parties;

        (b)  the relative wealth and income of the parties;

        (1)  The guidelines apply to any judicial or administrative order establishing or modifying

    an award of child support entered on or after July 1, 1989.

        (2) (a)  The child support guidelines shall be applied as a rebuttable presumption in

    establishing or modifying the amount of temporary or permanent child support.

        (b)  The rebuttable presumption means the provisions and considerations required by the

    guidelines, the award amounts resulting from the application of the guidelines, and the use of

- 90 -


    worksheets consistent with these guidelines are presumed to be correct, unless rebutted under the

    provisions of this section.

        (3)  A written finding or specific finding on the record supporting the conclusion that

    complying with a provision of the guidelines or ordering an award amount resulting from use of the

    guidelines would be unjust, inappropriate, or not in the best interest of a child in a particular case is

    sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case.

        (4) (a)  Natural or adoptive children of either parent who live in the home of that parent and

    are not children in common to both parties may at the option of either party be taken into account

    under the guidelines in setting or modifying a child support award, as provided in Subsection (5).

        (b)  Additional worksheets shall be prepared that compute the obligations of the respective

    parents for the additional children.  The obligations shall then be subtracted from the appropriate

    parent's income before determining the award in the instant case.

        (5)  In a proceeding to modify an existing award, consideration of natural or adoptive

    children other than those in common to both parties may be applied to mitigate an increase in the

    award but may not be applied to justify a decrease in the award.

        [(6)  With regard to child support orders, enactment of the guidelines and any subsequent

    change in the guidelines constitutes a substantial or material change of circumstances as a ground

    for modification or adjustment of a court order, if there is a difference of at least 25% between the

    existing order and the guidelines. In cases enforced under IV-D of Title IV of the Social Security

    Act, 42 U.S.C.  Section 601 et seq., the office may request modification, in accordance with the

    requirements of the Family Support Act of 1988, Public Law 100-485, no more often than once

    every three years.]

        (6) (a)  If a child support order has not been issued or modified within the previous three

    years, a parent, legal guardian, or the office may petition the court to adjust the amount of a child

    support order.

        (b)  Upon receiving a petition under Subsection (6)(a), the court shall, taking into account

    the best interests of the child, determine whether there is a difference between the amount ordered

    and the amount that would be required under the guidelines.  If there is a difference of 10% or more

- 91 -


    and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the court shall adjust the amount to that which is

    provided for in the guidelines.

        (c)  A showing of a substantial change in circumstances is not necessary for an adjustment

    under Subsection (6)(b).

        (7) (a)  A parent, legal guardian, or the office may at any time petition the court to adjust the

    amount of a child support order if there has been a substantial change in circumstances.

        (b)  For purposes of Subsection (7)(a), a substantial change in circumstances may include:

        (i)  material changes in custody;

        (ii)  material changes in the relative wealth or assets of the parties;

        (iii)  material changes of 30% or more in the income of a parent;

        (iv)  material changes in the ability of a parent to earn;

        (v)  material changes in the medical needs of the child; and

        (vi)  material changes in the legal responsibilities of either parent for the support of others.

        (c)  Upon receiving a petition under Subsection (7)(a), the court shall, taking into account

    the best interests of the child, determine whether a substantial change has occurred.  If it has, the

    court shall then determine whether the change results in a difference of 15% or more between the

    amount of child support ordered and the amount that would be required under the guidelines.  If

    there is such a difference and the difference is not of a temporary nature, the court shall adjust the

    amount of child support ordered to that which is provided for in the guidelines.

        (8)  Notice of the opportunity to adjust a support order under Subsections (6) and (7) shall

    be included in each child support order issued or modified after July 1, 1997.

    failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.

    a tribunal may stay enforcement of the registered order, continue the proceeding to permit production

    registered order may be enforced by all remedies available under the law of this state.

        (3)  If the contesting party does not establish a defense under Subsection (1) to the validity

    or enforcement of the order, the registering tribunal shall issue an order confirming the order.

    and [77-31a-604] 78-45f-604 if the order has not been registered.  A petition for modification may

    be filed at the same time as a request for registration, or later.  The pleading must specify the grounds

    for modification.

        Section 132.  Section  78-45f-610, which is renumbered from Section 77-31a-610 is

    renumbered and amended to read:

         [77-31a-610].      78-45f-610.  Effect of registration for modification.

        A tribunal of this state may enforce a child support order of another state registered for

    purposes of modification, in the same manner as if the order had been issued by a tribunal of this

    state, but the registered order may be modified only if the requirements of Section [77-31a-611]

    78-45f-611 have been met.

        Section 133.  Section  78-45f-611, which is renumbered from Section 77-31a-611 is

    renumbered and amended to read:

         [77-31a-611].      78-45f-611.  Modification of child support order of another state.

        (1)  After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this state, the

    responding tribunal of this state may modify that order only if[,] Section 78-45f-613 does not apply

    and after notice and hearing[,] it finds that:

        (a)  the following requirements are met:

        (i)  the child, the individual obligee, and the obligor[: (A)]  do not reside in the issuing state;

    [and]

        [(B)  either reside in this state or are subject to the jurisdiction of this state pursuant to

    Section 77-31a-201; and]

        [(ii)  in any case where another state is exercising or seeks to exercise jurisdiction to modify

    the order, the conditions of Section 77-31a-204 are met to the same extent as required for

    proceedings to establish orders; or]

        (ii)  a petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and

        (iii)  the respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or

        (b)  [an individual party or] the child, or a party who is an individual, is subject to the

    personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state and all of the [individual] parties who are individuals

    have filed [a] written [consent] consents in the issuing tribunal [providing that] for a tribunal of this

    state [may] to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order. 

    However, if the issuing state is a foreign jurisdiction that has not enacted a law or established

    procedures substantially similar to the procedures under this chapter, the consent otherwise required

    of an individual residing in this state is not required for the tribunal to assume jurisdiction to modify

    the child support order.

- 125 -


        (2)  Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements,

    procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state

    and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.

        (3)  A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not

    be modified under the law of the issuing state.  If two or more tribunals have issued child support

    orders for the same obligor and child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under

    Section 78-45f-207 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.

        (4)  On issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal

    of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

        [(5)  Within 30 days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the

    modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal which had continuing,

    exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows that earlier

    order has been registered.]

        Section 134.  Section  78-45f-612, which is renumbered from Section 77-31a-612 is

    renumbered and amended to read:

         [77-31a-612].      78-45f-612.  Recognition of order modified in another state.

        A tribunal of this state shall recognize a modification of its earlier child support order by a

    tribunal of another state which assumed jurisdiction pursuant to a law substantially similar to this

    chapter and, upon request, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, shall:

        (1)  enforce the order that was modified only as to amounts accruing before the modification;

        (2)  enforce only nonmodifiable aspects of that order;

        (3)  provide other appropriate relief only for violations of that order which occurred before

    the effective date of the modification; and

        (4)  recognize the modifying order of the other state, upon registration, for the purpose of

    enforcement.

        Section 135.  Section  78-45f-613 is enacted to read:

         78-45f-613.  Jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state when individual

     parties reside in this state.

- 126 -


        (1)  If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this state and the child does not reside

    in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and to modify the issuing state's

    child support order in a proceeding to register that order.

        (2)  A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the

    provisions of Parts 1 and 2, this part, and the procedural and substantive law of this state to the

    proceeding for enforcement of modification.  Parts 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 do not apply.

        Section 136.  Section  78-45f-614 is enacted to read:

         78-45f-614.  Notice to issuing tribunal of modification.

        Within 30 days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the

    modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing,

    exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier

    order has been registered.  A party who obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject

    to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises.  The failure to file

    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal having

    continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

        Section 137.  Section  78-45f-701, which is renumbered from Section 77-31a-701 is

    renumbered and amended to read:

     Part 7.  Determination of Parentage


         [77-31a-701].      78-45f-701.  Proceeding to determine parentage.

    brought under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter or [Title 77, Chapter 31,] 

    the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, to determine that the petitioner is a parent of

    a particular child or to determine that a respondent is a parent of that child.

        (2)  In a proceeding to determine parentage, a responding tribunal of this state shall apply

    Title 78, Chapter 45a, Uniform Act on Paternity, and the rules of this state on choice of law.

        Section 138.  Section  78-45f-801, which is renumbered from Section 77-31a-801 is

    renumbered and amended to read:

         [77-31a-801].      78-45f-801.  Grounds for rendition.

        (1)  For purposes of this part, "governor" includes an individual performing the functions of

    governor or the executive authority of a state covered by this chapter.

        (2)  The governor of this state may:

        (a)  demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual found in the other state

    who is charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee;

    or

        (b)  on the demand by the governor of another state, surrender an individual found in this

    state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of an

    obligee.

        (3)  A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this chapter applies to

    the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state when

    the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled therefrom.

        Section 139.  Section  78-45f-802, which is renumbered from Section 77-31a-802 is

    renumbered and amended to read:

         [77-31a-802].      78-45f-802.  Conditions of rendition.

        (1)  Before making demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged

    criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of

    this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least 60 days previously the

    obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would

    be of no avail.

        (2)  If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter or [Title 77, Chapter

    31,] the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, the governor of another state makes a

    demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with

    having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is

    owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a

    proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective.  If it appears that a proceeding would

    be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable

- 128 -


    time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.

        (3)  If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is

    demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand.  If the petitioner prevails and the

    individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to

    honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.
