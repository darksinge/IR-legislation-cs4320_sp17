    Utah State Prison has exceeded [operational] physical capacity for at least 45 calendar days, he

    may:

        (a)  notify the governor that an overcrowding emergency exists and provide him with

    information relevant to that determination; and

        (b)  notify the Board of Pardons and Parole of the existence of the overcrowding

    emergency so that the board may commence emergency releases pursuant to Subsection (2).

        (2)  Upon the governor's receipt of notification of the existence of an emergency release,

        (b)  in cooperation and consultation with the board, compile a list of inmates by

    chronological order according to their existing parole release dates, sufficient to eliminate the

    overcrowding emergency; and

        (c)  for each inmate listed in accordance with Subsection (2)(b), notify the board if the


    department has any reason to believe that the inmate has violated a disciplinary rule or for some

    other reason recommends that the inmate's existing parole date be rescinded.

        (3)  Unless the board has identified a reason to believe that the inmate's existing parole date

    should be rescinded, the parole release date of each inmate identified in Subsection (2)(b) may be

    advanced a sufficient number of days to allow for release.

        (4)  When the process described in Subsections (2) and (3) has been completed, the board

    may order the release of the eligible inmates.

        (5)  The department shall:

        (a)  send to the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice a list of names of the inmates

    released under this section; and

        (b)  provide the name and address of each inmate to the local law enforcement agency for the

    political subdivision in which the inmate intends to reside.

        (6)  The department shall inform the governor when the emergency release has been

    completed.
