789

    
record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for
            
790

    
the objection.  An objection may properly be made, received, and entered upon the record when
            
791

    
it is claimed that the person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on grounds of any
            
792

    
constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against
            
793

grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony of that person may be

compelled as in criminal cases.
            
799

    
    (h)  Any person appearing for oral examination pursuant to a demand served under this

    (6)  The providing of any testimony, documents, or objects in response to a civil
            
804

    
investigative demand issued pursuant to the provisions of this act shall be considered part of an
            
805

    
official proceeding as defined in Section

    (7) (a)  If a person fails to comply with the demand served upon him under this section,
            
807

    
the attorney general may file in the district court of the county in which the person resides, is
            
808

    
found, or does business, a petition for an order compelling compliance with the demand. 
            
809

    
Notice of hearing of the petition and a copy of the petition shall be served upon the person,
            
810

    
who may appear in opposition to the petition.  If the court finds that the demand is proper, that
            
811

    
there is reasonable cause to believe there has been a violation of this act, and that the
            
812

    
information sought or document or object demanded is relevant to the violation, it shall order
            
813

    
the person to comply with the demand, subject to modifications the court may prescribe.
            
814

    
    (b) (i)  At any time before the return date specified in a demand or within 30 days after
            
815

    
the demand has been served, whichever period is shorter, the person who has been served may
            
816

    
file a petition for an order modifying or setting aside the demand.  This petition shall be filed in
            
817

    
the district court in the county of the person's residence, principal office, or place of business,
            
818

    
or in the district court in Salt Lake County.  The petition shall specify each ground upon which
            
819

    
the petitioner relies in seeking the relief sought.  The petition may be based upon any failure of
            
820

    
the demand to comply with the provisions of this section or upon any constitutional or other
            
821

    
legal right or privilege of the petitioner.  The petitioner shall serve notice of hearing of the
            
822

    
petition and a copy of the petition upon the attorney general.  The attorney general may submit
            
823

    
an answer to the petition within 30 days after receipt of the petition.
            
824

    
    (ii)  After hearing on the petition described in Subsection (7)(b)(i), and for good cause
            
825

    
shown, the court may make any further order in the proceedings that justice requires to protect
            
826

    
the person from unreasonable annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, burden, or expense.  At
            
827

    
any hearing pursuant to this section it is the attorney general's burden to establish that the
            
828

    
demand is proper, that there is reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of this
            
829

    
act, and that the information sought or document or object demanded is relevant to the
            
830

    
violation.
            
831

    
    (8) (a)  Any procedure, testimony taken, or material produced under this section shall be
            
832

    
kept confidential by the attorney general unless confidentiality is waived in writing by the
            
833

    
person who has testified, or produced documents or objects.

            
834


    
    (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the attorney general may
            
835

    
disclose testimony or documents obtained under this section, without either the consent of the
            
836

    
person from whom it was received or the person being investigated, to:
            
837

    
    (i)  any grand jury; and
            
838

    
    (ii)  officers and employees of federal or state law enforcement agencies, provided the
            
839

    
person from whom the information, documents, or objects were obtained is notified 20 days
            
840

    
prior to disclosure, and the federal or state law enforcement agency certifies that the
            
841

    
information will be:
            
842

    
    (A)  maintained in confidence, as required by Subsection (8)(a); and
            
843

    
    (B)  used only for official law enforcement purposes.
            
844

    
    (9)  Use of a civil investigative demand under this action precludes the invocation by

866

    
injured or is threatened with injury in his business or property by a violation of the Utah
            
867

    
Antitrust Act may bring an action for injunctive relief and damages, regardless of whether the
            
868

    
person dealt directly or indirectly with the defendant.  This remedy is in addition to any other

remedies provided by law.  It may not diminish or offset any other remedy.

addition to granting any appropriate temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief.
            
873

    
    (2) (a)  If the court determines that a judgment in the amount of three times the damages
            
874

    
awarded plus attorney fees and costs will directly cause the insolvency of the defendant, the
            
875

    
court shall reduce the amount of judgment to the highest sum that would not cause the
            
876

    
defendant's insolvency.
            
877

    
    (b)  The court may not reduce a judgment to an amount less than the amount of
            
878

    
damages sustained plus the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney fees.
            
879

its official or employee acting in an official capacity.

    (5)  Subsection (4) does not apply to cases filed before April 27, 1987, unless the
            
889

    
defendant establishes and the court determines that in light of all the circumstances, including
            
890

    
the posture of litigation and the availability of alternative relief, it would be inequitable not to
            
891

    
apply Subsection (4) to a pending case.
            
892

    
    (6)  When a defendant has been sued in one or more actions by both direct and indirect
            
893

    
purchasers, whether in state court or federal court, a defendant shall be entitled to prove as a
            
894

    
partial or complete defense to a claim for damages that the damages incurred by the plaintiff or
            
895

    
plaintiffs have been passed on to others who are entitled to recover so as to avoid duplication

            
896


    
of recovery of damages.  In an action by indirect purchasers, any damages or settlement
            
897

    
amounts paid to direct purchasers for the same alleged antitrust violations shall constitute a
            
898

    
defense in the amount paid on a claim by indirect purchasers under this chapter so as to avoid
            
899

    
duplication of recovery of damages.
            
900

    
    (7)  It shall be presumed, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the injured
            
901

    
persons who dealt directly with the defendant incurred at least 1/3 of the damages, and shall,
            
902

    
therefore, recover at least 1/3 of the awarded damages.  It shall also be presumed, in the
            
903

    
absence of proof to the contrary, that the injured persons who dealt indirectly with the
            
904

    
defendant incurred at least 1/3 of the damages, and shall, therefore, recover at least 1/3 of the
            
905

    
awarded damages.  The final 1/3 of the damages shall be awarded by the court to those injured
            
906

    
persons determined by the court as most likely to have absorbed the damages.
            
907

    
    (8)  There is a presumption, in the absence of proof to the contrary and subject to
            
908

    
Subsection (7), that each level in a product's or service's distribution chain passed on any and
            
909

    
all increments in its cost due to an increase in the cost of an ingredient or a component product
            
910

    
or service that was caused by a violation of this chapter.  This amount will be presumed, in the
            
911

    
absence of evidence to the contrary, to be equal to the change in the cost, in dollars and cents,
            
912

    
of the ingredient, component product, or service to its first purchaser.
            
913

    
    (9)  The attorney general shall be notified by the plaintiff about the filing of any class
            
914

    
action involving antitrust violations that includes plaintiffs from this state.  The attorney
            
915

    
general shall receive a copy of each filing from each plaintiff.  The attorney general may, in his
            
916

    
or her discretion, intervene or file amicus briefs in the case, and may be heard on the question
            
917

    
of the fairness or appropriateness of any proposed settlement agreement.
            
918

    
    (10)  If, in a class action or parens patriae action filed under this chapter, including the
            
919

    
settlement of any action, it is not feasible to return any part of the recovery to the injured
            
920

    
plaintiffs, the court shall order the residual funds be applied to benefit the specific class of
            
921

    
injured plaintiffs, to improve antitrust enforcement generally by depositing the residual funds
            
922

    
into the Attorney General Litigation Fund created by Section [

76-10-922

] 

76-10-3114

, or both.
            
923

    
    (11)  In any action brought under this chapter, the court shall approve all attorney fees
            
924

    
and arrangements for the payment of attorney fees, including contingency fee agreements.
