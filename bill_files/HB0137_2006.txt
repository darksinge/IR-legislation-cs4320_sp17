    (b)  The examination may be ordered by the division, with the consent of a majority of

    (i)  the nurse is mentally ill or incapacitated or otherwise unable to practice nursing with
            
415

    
reasonable skill and safety; and

    (ii)  The division may enter the order of suspension without further compliance with

Title 63, Chapter 46b, Administrative Procedures Act, unless the division finds the failure to
            
423

    
submit to the examination ordered under this section was due to circumstances beyond the

control of the nurse and was not related directly to the illness or incapacity of the nurse.
            
425

433

    
presented by the nurse, under procedures established by division rule, regarding any change in
            
434

    
the nurse's condition, to determine whether:
            
435

    
    (a)  he is or is not able to safely and competently engage in the practice of nursing; and
            
436
