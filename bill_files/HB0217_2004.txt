    (B)  the contractor establishes reasons for the change that meet the standards established
            
101

    
by the State Building Board.

103

    
contract price for subcontracted work, the total of the prime contract may be reduced to reflect
            
104

    
the changes.
            
105

    
    (4) (a)  A bidder may list himself as a subcontractor when the bidder is currently

109

    
    (ii)  the bidder intends to obtain a subcontractor to perform the work at a later date
            
110

    
because the bidder was unable to:

    (A)  obtain a bid from a qualified subcontractor; or
            
112

113

120

    
director's written request.

    (iii)  If the bidder's submitted information causes the director to reasonably believe that
            
122

    
self-performance of the portion of the work by the bidder is likely to yield a substandard
            
123

    
finished product, the director shall:
            
124

    
    (A)  require the bidder to use a subcontractor for the portion of the work in question and
            
125

126

    
    (B)  reject the bidder's bid.

date, the bidder shall provide documentation with the subcontractor list describing:
            
129

    
    (A)  the bidder's efforts to obtain a bid of a qualified subcontractor at a reasonable cost;
            
130

    
and
            
131

    
    (B)  why the bidder was unable to obtain a qualified subcontractor bid.
            
132

    
    (ii)  If the bidder who intends to obtain a subcontractor to perform the work at a later
            
133

    
date is awarded a contract, the director shall supervise the bidder's efforts to obtain a qualified
            
134

    
subcontractor bid.
            
135

    
    (iii)  The director may not adjust the amount of the contract awarded in order to reflect
            
136

    
the actual amount of the subcontractor's bid.
            
137

    
    (5)  The division may not disclose any subcontractor bid amounts obtained under this
            
138

    
section until the division has awarded the project to a contractor.
            
139

    
    [(6) (a)  The director may establish a Contractor Performance Review Committee to:]
            
140
