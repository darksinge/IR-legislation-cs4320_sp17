    (b) (i)  On motion of the enforcing authority and without bond in an action under this
            
117

    
Subsection (2), the court may make appropriate orders, including appointment of a master or

128

    
damages can be computed with reasonable certainty, damages recoverable on behalf of
            
129

    
consumers who cannot be located with due diligence shall be transferred to the state treasurer
            
130

    
pursuant to Title 67, Chapter  4a, Unclaimed Property Act.
            
131

    
    (d)  If a supplier shows by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation of this
            
132

    
chapter resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures
            
133

    
reasonably adapted to avoid the error, recovery under this Subsection (2) is limited to the
            
134

    
amount, if any, by which the supplier was unjustly enriched by the violation.

    (3) (a)  The enforcing authority may terminate an investigation or an action other than a
            
138

    
class action upon acceptance of the supplier's written assurance of voluntary compliance with
            
139

    
this chapter.  Acceptance of an assurance may be conditioned on a commitment to reimburse
            
140

    
consumers or take other appropriate corrective action.
            
141

    
    (b)  An assurance is not evidence of a prior violation of this chapter. Unless an
            
142

    
assurance has been rescinded by agreement of the parties or voided by a court for good cause,
            
143

    
subsequent failure to comply with the terms of an assurance is prima facie evidence of a
            
144

    
violation.
            
145

    
    (4) (a)  In addition to other penalties and remedies set out under this chapter, and in

149

    
    (b)  All money received through administrative fines imposed under this section shall
            
150

    
be deposited in the Consumer Protection Education and Training Fund created by Section
