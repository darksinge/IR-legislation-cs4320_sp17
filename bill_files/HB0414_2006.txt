Highlighted Provisions                                This bill                                .    requires that the Department of Human Services advise the court, prosecutor, and                           defense counsel if the defendant, who has been found incompetent and has been                           committed to the department for treatment, is not responding to treatment without                           involuntary medication                                .    establishes criteria the Department of Human Services is to address in evaluating                           the defendant                                .    requires that upon receipt of notice from the Department of Health, the court shall                           schedule a hearing regarding if the defendant should be ordered to be involuntarily                           medicated and provides criteria the court shall consider                                .    provides a standard of clear and convincing evidence for the judicial determination                            and                               .    limits application of this bill to when the sole purpose for considering involuntary                           medication is to render the defendant competent to proceed with the criminal trial.

As used in this section                                 a    Executive director  means the executive director of the Department of Human                          Services or the executive director s designee.                                b    Final order  means a court order that determines the rights of the parties and                          concerning which appellate remedies have been exhausted or the time for appeal has expired.                                    a   At any time after a defendant has been found incompetent to proceed and has                          been committed to the Department of Human Services under Section                 for treatment to                          restore competency, the executive director shall notify the court, prosecuting attorney, and                          attorney for the defendant if the executive director has determined that the defendant is not                          responding to treatment and is unlikely to be restored to competency without the involuntary                          administration of antipsychotic medication.                                b   The executive director shall provide the notification under Subsection     a  only if                          there is no basis for involuntarily medicating the defendant for reasons other than to restore the                          defendant s competency.                                    In the notice under Subsection     a , the executive director shall address whether                                 a   medication is necessary to render the defendant competent                                 b   medication is substantially likely to render the defendant competent                                 c   medication is substantially unlikely to produce side effects which would                          significantly interfere with the defendant s ability to assist in his defense                                 d   any less intrusive means are available, and if so, if any of those means have been                             attempted to render the defendant competent  and                                e   medication is medically appropriate and is in the defendant s best medical interest                          in light of his medical condition.                                    a   Upon receipt of the notice under Subsection     a , the court shall conduct a                          hearing within    days, unless the court extends the time for good cause, to determine whether                          the court should convene a hearing regarding the involuntary medication of the defendant.                                b   The court shall conduct an involuntary medication hearing according to the                          procedures outlined in Subsections       A               b  through     f .                                c   The prosecuting attorney shall represent the state at any hearing under this section.                                d   The court shall consider whether the following factors apply in determining                          whether the defendant should be involuntarily medicated                                 i   important state interests are at stake in restoring the defendant s competency                                 ii   involuntary medication will significantly further the important state interests, in                          that the medication proposed                                 A   is substantially likely to render the defendant competent to stand trial  and                                B   is substantially unlikely to produce side effects which would significantly interfere                          with the defendant s ability to assist the defense counsel in conducting his defense                                 iii   involuntary medication is necessary to further important state interests, because                          any alternate less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve substantially the same results  and                                iv   the administration of the proposed medication is medically appropriate, as it is in                          the defendant s best medical interest in light of his medical condition.                                    In determining whether the proposed treatment is medically appropriate and is in                          the defendant s best medical interest, the potential penalty the defendant may be subject to, if                          the defendant is convicted of any charged offense, is not a relevant consideration.                                    a   If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the involuntary                          administration of antipsychotic medication is appropriate, it shall make findings addressing                          each of the factors in Subsection     d  and shall issue an order authorizing the Department of                          Human Services to involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication to the defendant in order                          to restore his competency, subject to the periodic reviews and other procedures provided in                          Section                .                                b   When issuing an order under Subsection     a , the court shall consider ordering                             less intrusive means for administering the drugs, such as a court order to the defendant                          enforceable by the contempt power, before ordering more intrusive methods of involuntary                          medication.                                    The provisions in Section                 establishing time limitations for treatment of                          incompetent defendants before they must be either released or civilly committed are tolled                          from the time the executive director gives notice to the court and the parties under Subsection                              until                                 a   the court determines the outcome of treatment administered pursuant to a final                          order issued under Subsection     a  and the defendant has been involuntarily medicated under                          that final order  or                                 b   the court determines that involuntary medication is not appropriate.                                     This section applies only when the prosecution seeks an order of involuntary                           medication solely for the purpose of rendering a defendant competent to proceed.
