order to vacate the conviction.  The state may by motion request an extension of the 30 days,
            
166

    
which the court may grant upon good cause shown.
            
167

    
    (b)  The state may stipulate to the conviction being vacated, or may request a hearing
            
168

    
and attempt to demonstrate through evidence and argument that, despite the DNA test results,
            
169

    
the state possesses sufficient evidence of the person's guilt so that [he] the person is unable to

            
170


    
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that [he] the person is [actually] factually
            
171

    
innocent of one or more offenses of which [he] the person was convicted, and all the lesser
            
172

    
included offenses related to those offenses.
            
173

    
    (2) (a) (i)  If the result of postconviction DNA testing is favorable to the person and the
            
174

    
state opposes vacating the conviction, the court shall consider all the evidence presented at the
            
175

    
original trial and at the hearing under Subsection (1)(b), including the new DNA test result. 
            
176

    
[Evidence that would otherwise have been suppressed at criminal trial is admissible, unless the
            
177

    
evidence is an unconstitutionally coerced statement from the person.]
            
178

    
    (ii)  The court may consider:
            
179

    
    (A)  evidence that was suppressed or would be suppressed at a criminal trial; and
            
180

    
    (B)  hearsay evidence, and may consider that the evidence is hearsay in evaluating its
            
181

    
weight and credibility.
            
182

    
    (b)  If the court, after considering all the evidence, determines that the DNA test result
            
183

    
demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the person is [actually] factually innocent of
            
184

    
one or more offenses of which the person was convicted [and all lesser included offenses
            
185

    
relating to those offenses], the court shall order that those convictions be vacated with prejudice
            
186

    
and those convictions be expunged from the person's record.
            
187

    
    (c)  If the court, after considering all the evidence presented at the original trial and at
            
188

    
the hearing under Subsection (1)(b), including the new DNA test result, finds by clear and
            
189

    
convincing evidence that the person [is actually innocent of] did not commit one or more
            
190

    
offenses of which the person was convicted, but the court does not find by clear and convincing
            
191

    
evidence that the person [is actually innocent of all] did not commit any lesser included offenses
            
192

    
relating to those offenses, the court shall modify the original conviction and sentence of the
            
193

    
person as appropriate for the lesser included offense, whether or not the lesser included offense
            
194

    
was originally submitted to the trier of fact.
            
195

    
    (d)  If the court, after considering all the evidence presented at the original trial and at
            
196

    
the hearing under Subsection (1)(b), including the new DNA test result, does not find by clear
            
197

    
and convincing evidence that the person is [actually] factually innocent of the offense or

            
198


    
offenses the person is challenging and does not find that Subsection (2)(c) applies, the court
            
199

    
shall deny the person's petition regarding the offense or offenses.

217

    
is factually innocent of the crime or crimes of which the person was convicted, if the person

363

to be factually innocent had never occurred.
