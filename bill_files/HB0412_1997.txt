The modified program shall run for at least three years, subject to reauthorization by         the Legislature based upon an evaluation and the achievement of the student performance goals         required under Subsection   A  a        d  i .

The State Board of Education shall, after consulting with the affected local school          boards, schools, and parents of students at the schools, adopt rules for implementation of this          section.                   a   In addition to the modified centennial schools authorized under Subsection    ,          individual centennial schools may participate in the modified program under the following          circumstances                i   the school has been a centennial school for at least three years                ii   the school directors receive a petition requesting participation in the program by at          least     of the parents whose children attend the school                iii   the petition is voted on by the parents whose children attend the school and receives          a majority vote in favor of becoming a modified centennial school and is ratified by a majority of          the school s faculty and administrators                iv   the school is subject to Subsections     through      and               v   the school will not receive additional state funding under this section.               b   For purposes of Subsection     a  iii ,  majority vote  means a majority of those voting          on the issue.
