and(b)  the electronic document when issued contains a statement that it is issued insubstitution for the tangible document.(4)  Upon issuance of an electronic document of title in substitution for a tangibledocument of title in accordance with Subsection (3):(a)  the tangible document ceases to have any effect or validity; and(b)  the person that procured issuance of the electronic document warrants to allsubsequent persons entitled under the electronic document that the warrantor was a personentitled under the tangible document when the warrantor surrendered possession of the tangibledocument to the issuer.    70A-7a-106.(1)  A person has control of an electronic document of title if a system employed forevidencing the transfer of interests in the electronic document reliably establishes that personas the person to which the electronic document was issued or transferred.(2)  A system satisfies Subsection (1), and a person is considered to have control of anelectronic document of title, if the document is created, stored, and assigned in such a mannerthat:(a)  a single authoritative copy of the document exists which is unique, identifiable,and, except as otherwise provided in Subsections (2)(d), (e), and (f), unalterable;(b)  the authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as:(i)  the person to which the document was issued; or(ii)  if the authoritative copy indicates that the document has been transferred, theperson to which the document was most recently transferred;(c)  the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the person assertingcontrol or its designated custodian;(d)  copies or amendments that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritativecopy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control;(e)  each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable asa copy that is not the authoritative copy;

 or its duty of care underSection

.  Any contrary provision is ineffective.    70A-7a-203.A party to or purchaser for value in good faith of a document of title, other than a bill oflading, that relies upon the description of the goods in the document may recover from theissuer damages caused by the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extentthat:(1)  the document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all orpart of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in whichthe description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition, or the receipt ordescription is qualified by "contents, condition, and quality unknown," "said to contain," orwords of similar import, if the indication is true; or(2)  the party or purchaser otherwise has notice of the nonreceipt or misdescription.    70A-7a-204.(1)  A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by itsfailure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exerciseunder similar circumstances.  Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damagesthat could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.(2)  Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreementlimiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is notliable.  Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversionto its own use.  On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreementor within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse's liability maybe increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehousereceipt.  In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of thegoods.(3)  Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims andcommencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storageagreement.    70A-7a-205.A buyer in ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by awarehouse that is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes the goods free ofany claim under a warehouse receipt even if the receipt is negotiable and has been dulynegotiated.    70A-7a-206.(1)  A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are heldand any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of anycharges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period ofstorage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not lessthan 30 days after the warehouse gives notice.  If the goods are not removed before the datespecified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to Section

.(2)  If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or declinein value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in Subsection (1) andSection 

70A-7a-210

, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under Subsection (1) anyreasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sellthem at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.(3)  If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did nothave notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehousefacilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale withoutadvertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest inthe goods.  If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it maydispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.(4)  A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under thischapter upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.(5)  A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition underthis section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which thewarehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.    70A-7a-207.(1)  Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separatethe goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery ofthose goods.  However, different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.(2)  If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in commonby the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for thatowner's share.  If, because of overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all thereceipts the warehouse has issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to whichoverissued receipts have been duly negotiated.    70A-7a-208.If a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in withoutauthority, a good-faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treatthe insertion as authorized.  Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronicwarehouse receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.    70A-7a-209.(1)  A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehousereceipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storageor transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges,present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of thegoods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  If the person on whose account thegoods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods wheneverdeposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimedfor charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against thegoods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in itspossession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been deliveredby the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt isduly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified inthe warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage ofthe specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.(2)  A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for themaximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in Subsection(1), such as for money advanced and interest.  The security interest is governed by Chapter 9a,Uniform Commercial Code - Secured Transactions.(3)  A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under Subsection (1) or a securityinterest under Subsection (2) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailorwith possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser forvalue would have been valid.  However, the lien or security interest is not effective against aperson that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected securityinterest in the goods and that did not:(a)  deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to thebailor or the bailor's nominee with:(i)  actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;(ii)  power to obtain delivery under Section

(3) or other statuteor rule of law; or(b)  acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.(4)  A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to thegoods under Subsection (1) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legalpossessor of the goods at the time of deposit.  In this Subsection (4), "household goods" meansfurniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.(5)  A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiablyrefuses to deliver.    70A-7a-210.(1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2), a warehouse's lien may be enforcedby public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on anyterms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interestin the goods.  The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of theproposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could havebeen obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by thewarehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commerciallyreasonable manner.  The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if thewarehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at theprice current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity withcommercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of moregoods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is notcommercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.(2)  A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchantin the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:(a)  All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.(b)  The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description ofthe goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than tendays after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paidwithin that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified timeand place.(c)  The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.(d)  The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held orstored.(e)  After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of thesale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of generalcirculation where the sale is to be held.  The advertisement must include a description of thegoods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time andplace of the sale.  The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first publication.  If there isno newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must beposted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six conspicuous places in theneighborhood of the proposed sale.(3)  Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goodsmay pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred incomplying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained bythe warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this chapter.(4)  A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.(5)  A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes thegoods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse'snoncompliance with this section.(6)  A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to thissection but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which thewarehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.(7)  The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by lawto a creditor against a debtor.(8)  If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien maybe enforced in accordance with Subsection (1) or (2).(9)  A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with therequirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable forconversion.    70A-7a-301.(1)  A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith,or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description ofthe goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damagescaused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except tothe extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of thegoods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which thedescription is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt ordescription is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown," "said tocontain," "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import, if that indication istrue.(2)  If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:(a)  the issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain thekind and quantity if shipped in bulk; and(b)  words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar importindicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goodsconcealed in packages.(3)  If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill oflading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind andquantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so.  Inthat case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective.(4)  The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight,load, and count," or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by theshipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by theimproper loading.  However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damagescaused by improper loading.(5)  A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of thedescription, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by theshipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies inthose particulars.  This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or liabilityunder the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.    70A-7a-302.(1)  The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying anundertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, isliable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the otherperson or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document.  However, tothe extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or interritory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including mattersother than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carriermay be varied by agreement of the parties.(2)  If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodyingan undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by thatperson, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in itspossession, to the obligation of the issuer.  The person's obligation is discharged by delivery ofthe goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liabilityfor breach by any other person or by the issuer.(3)  The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described inSubsection (1) is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in possessionof the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred:(a)  the amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill orother document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript ofjudgment; and(b)  the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending anyaction commenced by any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for thebreach.    70A-7a-303.(1)  Unless the bill of lading otherwise provides, a carrier may deliver the goods to aperson or destination other than that stated in the bill or may otherwise dispose of the goods,without liability for misdelivery, on instructions from:(a)  the holder of a negotiable bill;(b)  the consignor on a nonnegotiable bill, even if the consignee has given contraryinstructions;(c)  the consignee on a nonnegotiable bill in the absence of contrary instructions fromthe consignor, if the goods have arrived at the billed destination or if the consignee is inpossession of the tangible bill or in control of the electronic bill; or(d)  the consignee on a nonnegotiable bill, if the consignee is entitled as against theconsignor to dispose of the goods.(2)  Unless instructions described in Subsection (1) are included in a negotiable bill oflading, a person to which the bill is duly negotiated may hold the bailee according to theoriginal terms.    70A-7a-304.(1)  Except as customary in international transportation, a tangible bill of lading maynot be issued in a set of parts.  The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of thisSubsection (1).(2)  If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which containsan identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been deliveredagainst any other part, the whole of the parts constitutes one bill.(3)  If a tangible negotiable bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and differentparts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiationis made prevails as to both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder mayhave received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier's obligation bysurrendering its part.(4)  A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issuedin a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set.(5)  The bailee shall deliver in accordance with Chapter 4, Uniform Commercial Code -Bank Deposits and Collections, against the first presented part of a tangible bill of ladinglawfully issued in a set.  Delivery in this manner discharges the bailee's obligation on the wholebill.    70A-7a-305.(1)  Instead of issuing a bill of lading to the consignor at the place of shipment, acarrier, at the request of the consignor, may procure the bill to be issued at destination or at anyother place designated in the request.(2)  Upon request of any person entitled as against a carrier to control the goods whilein transit and on surrender of possession or control of any outstanding bill of lading or otherreceipt covering the goods, the issuer, subject to Section 

70A-7a-105

, may procure a substitutebill to be issued at any place designated in the request.    70A-7a-306.An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the billenforceable according to its original tenor.    70A-7a-307.(1)  A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceedsthereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier's receipt of the goods forstorage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expensesnecessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred intheir sale pursuant to law.  However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading,a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no chargesare stated, a reasonable charge.(2)  A lien for charges and expenses under Subsection (1) on goods that the carrier wasrequired by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any personentitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subjectthe goods to those charges and expenses.  Any other lien under Subsection (1) is effectiveagainst the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession ofthe goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.(3)  A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiablyrefuses to deliver.    70A-7a-308.(1)  A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, inbulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable,after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification mustinclude a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and placeof any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a differenttime or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient toestablish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sellsgoods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner inany recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale,or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in thetype of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensuresatisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by thepreceding sentence.(2)  Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goodsmay pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred incomplying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained bythe carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this chapter.(3)  A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.(4)  A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goodsfree of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier'snoncompliance with this section.(5)  A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this sectionbut shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrierwould have been bound to deliver the goods.(6)  The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by lawto a creditor against a debtor.(7)  A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either Subsection (1) or the procedureset forth in Subsection

(2).(8)  A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirementsfor sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.    70A-7a-309.(1)  A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shallexercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person wouldexercise under similar circumstances.  This Subsection (1) does not affect any statute,regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not causedby its negligence.(2)  Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportationagreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportationagreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded anopportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity.

    (3)  A system satisfies Subsection (2), and a person is deemed to have control of a

satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable
            
221

    
document of title has been duly negotiated, or a purchaser, respectively.
            
222

    
    (b)  Delivery, possession, and indorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of
            
223

    
the rights under Subsection (4)(a).
            
224

566

    
    (1)  Where the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or

    (2)  Where in a case within Subsection (1) a tangible bill of lading has been issued in a
            
571

    
set of parts, unless otherwise agreed, if the documents are not to be sent from abroad, the buyer
            
572

    
may demand tender of the full set; otherwise only one part of the bill of lading need be
            
573

    
tendered. Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set:
            
574

    
    (a)  due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this chapter on cure
            
575

70A-2-508

); and

Section  
70A-2-401

 is amended to read:
            
583

    
     70A-2-401.  Passing of title -- Reservation for security -- Limited application of
            
584

    
 this section.
            
585

    
    Each provision of this chapter with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the
            
586

    
seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods
            
587

    
except where the provision refers to such title.  In so far as situations are not covered by the
            
588

    
other provisions of this chapter and matters concerning title become material the following
            
589

    
rules apply:

            
590


    
    (1)  Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to
            
591

    
the contract (Section 

70A-2-501

), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by
            
592

    
their identification a special property as limited by this act.  Any retention or reservation by the
            
593

    
seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a
            
594

    
reservation of a security interest.  Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the
            
595

    
chapter on Secured Transactions (Chapter [9] 9a), title to goods passes from the seller to the
            
596

    
buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.
            
597

    
    (2)  Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at
            
598

    
which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the
            
599

    
goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be
            
600

    
delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security
            
601

    
interest by the bill of lading:
            
602

    
    (a)  if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but
            
603

    
does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and
            
604

    
place of shipment; but
            
605

    
    (b)  if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.
            
606

    
    (3)  Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the
            
607

    
goods[,]:
            
608

    
    (a)  if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when
            
609

    
and the place where he delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic
            
610

    
document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or
            
611

    
    (b)  if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of
            
612

    
title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.
            
613

    
    (4)  A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or
            
614

    
not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller.  Such
            
615

    
revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale."
            
616

    
    Section 9.  
Section  
70A-2-403

 is amended to read:
            
617

    
     70A-2-403.  Power to transfer -- Good faith purchase of goods -- Definition of

            
618


    
 entrusting.
            
619

    
    (1)  A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to
            
620

    
transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the
            
621

    
interest purchased.  A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good
            
622

    
faith purchaser for value.  When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the
            
623

    
purchaser has such power even though:
            
624

    
    (a)  the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser;
            
625

    
    (b)  the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored;
            
626

    
    (c)  it was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale"; or
            
627

    
    (d)  the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal
            
628

    
law.
            
629

    
    (2)  Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that
            
630

    
kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of
            
631

    
business.
            
632

    
    (3)  "Entrusting" includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession
            
633

    
regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and
            
634

    
regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the
            
635

    
goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.
            
636

    
    (4)  The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by
            
637

    
Chapter 9a, Uniform Commercial Code - Secured Transactions and Chapter [7, Uniform
            
638

640

    
     70A-2-503.  Manner of seller's tender of delivery.
            
641

    
    (1)  Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the
            
642

    
buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to

take delivery.  The manner, time, and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this
            
644

    
chapter, and in particular:
            
645

    
    (a)  tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods, they must be kept

            
646


    
available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but
            
647

    
    (b)  unless otherwise agreed, the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the
            
648

    
receipt of the goods.
            
649

    
    (2)  Where the case is within the next section, respecting shipment tender requires that
            
650

    
the seller comply with its provisions.
            
651

    
    (3)  Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination, tender requires
            
652

    
that he comply with Subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as
            
653

    
described in Subsections (4) and (5) of this section.
            
654

    
    (4)  Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being
            
655

    
moved:
            
656

    
    (a)  tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering
            
657

    
such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the
            
658

    
goods; but
            
659

    
    (b)  tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a [written direction
            
660

    
to] record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects,
            
661

    
and except as otherwise provided in Chapter 9a, Uniform Commercial Code - Secured
            
662

    
Transactions, receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as
            
663

    
against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the
            
664

    
bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the
            
665

    
seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a
            
666

    
refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.
            
667

    
    (5)  Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents:
            
668

    
    (a)  he must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this
            
669

    
chapter with respect to bills of lading in a set [(Subsection (2) of Section 

70A-2-323

)] as
            
670

    
provided in Subsection 

70A-2-323

(2); and
            
671

    
    (b)  tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft
            
672

    
accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.
            
673

    
    Section 11.  
Section  
70A-2-505

 is amended to read:

            
674


    
     70A-2-505.  Seller's shipment under reservation.
            
675

    
    (1)  Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment:
            
676

    
    (a)  his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves
            
677

    
in him a security interest in the goods.  His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing
            
678

    
agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that
            
679

    
interest to the person named[.]; and
            
680

    
    (b)  a nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the
            
681

    
goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery [(Subsection (2) of Section
            
682

    


70A-2-507

)] as provided in Subsection 

70A-2-507

(2), a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming
            
683

    
the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or
            
684

    
control of the bill of lading.
            
685

    
    (2)  When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of
            
686

    
the contract for sale, it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding
            
687

    
section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the
            
688

    
goods to the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.
            
689

693

    
rights under the draft and any document of title securing it any rights of the shipper in the
            
694

    
goods including the right to stop delivery and the shipper's right to have the draft honored by
            
695

    
the buyer.
            
696

    
    (2)  The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith honored
            
697

    
or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the buyer is not impaired by
            
698

    
subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document which was apparently
            
699

    
regular [on its face].

    (1)  Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier:

    (a)  if it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss
            
704

    
passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment
            
705

    
is under reservation [(] as provided in Section

 70A-2-505

[)]; but
            
706

    
    (b)  if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are
            
707

    
there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer
            
708

    
when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.
            
709

    
    (2)  Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk
            
710

    (a)  on his receipt of possession or control of a negotiable document of title covering the

Section 

70A-2-503

717

    
    (3)  In any case not within Subsection (1) or (2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on
            
718

    
his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on
            
719

     70A-2-605.  Waiver of buyer's objections by failure to particularize.
            
725

    
    (1)  The buyer's failure to state in connection with rejection a particular defect which is
            
726

    
ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes him from relying on the unstated defect to

1128

    
    (1)  A person has control of an electronic document of title if a system employed for

1153

    
statute requiring a bond against withdrawal or a license for the issuance of receipts in the
            
1154

    
nature of warehouse receipts, a receipt issued for the goods is considered to be a warehouse
            
1155

    
receipt even if issued by a person that is the owner of the goods and is not a warehouse.
            
1156

    (1)  the document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all or
            
1188

    
part of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in which
            
1189

failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise
            
1197

    
under similar circumstances.  Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages

1200

    
limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not
            
1201

    
liable.  Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversion
            
1202

    
to its own use.  On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement

reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell
            
1228

    
them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.

    (3)  If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not

have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse

1232

the goods.  If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may

dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.

chapter upon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.
            
1237

    
    (5)  A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under
            
1238

     70A-7a-207.  Goods must be kept separate -- Fungible goods.
            
1242

    
    (1)  Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separate
            
1243

    
the goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of
            
1244

    
those goods.  However, different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.

    (2)  If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common
            
1246

    
by the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that
            
1247

    
owner's share.  If, because of overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the
            
1248

    
receipts the warehouse has issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to which

the insertion as authorized.  Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronic

 is enacted to read:
            
1257

    
     70A-7a-209.  Lien of warehouse.
            
1258

    
    (1)  A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse
            
1259

    
receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage
            
1260

    
or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges,
            
1261

    
present or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the

            
1262


    
goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  If the person on whose account the
            
1263

    
goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever
            
1264

    
deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed
            
1265

    
for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the
            
1266

    
goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its
            
1267

    
possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered
            
1268

    
by the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is
            
1269

    
duly negotiated, a warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in
            
1270

    
the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of
            
1271

    
the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.
            
1272

    
    (2)  A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the
            
1273

    
maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in Subsection
            
1274

    
(1), such as for money advanced and interest.  The security interest is governed by Chapter 9a,
            
1275

    
Uniform Commercial Code - Secured Transactions.
            
1276

    
    (3)  A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under Subsection (1) or a security
            
1277

    
interest under Subsection (2) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor
            
1278

    
with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good-faith purchaser for
            
1279

    
value would have been valid.  However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a
            
1280

    
person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security
            
1281

    
interest in the goods and that did not:
            
1282

    
    (a)  deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the
            
1283

    
bailor or the bailor's nominee with:
            
1284

    
    (i)  actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;
            
1285

    
    (ii)  power to obtain delivery under Section 

70A-7a-403

    (b)  acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.

            
1290


    
    (4)  A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the
            
1291

    
goods under Subsection (1) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal
            
1292

    
possessor of the goods at the time of deposit.  In this Subsection (4), "household goods" means
            
1293

    
furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.
            
1294

    
    (5)  A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably
            
1295

    
refuses to deliver.
            
1296

    
    Section 37.  
Section  
70A-7a-210

 is enacted to read:
            
1297

    
     70A-7a-210.  Enforcement of warehouse's lien.
            
1298

    
    (1)  Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (2), a warehouse's lien may be enforced
            
1299

    
by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any
            
1300

    
terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest
            
1301

    
in the goods.  The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the
            
1302

    
proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have
            
1303

    
been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the
            
1304

    
warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially
            
1305

    
reasonable manner.  The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the
            
1306

    
warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the
            
1307

    
price current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with
            
1308

    
commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more
            
1309

    
goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not
            
1310

    
commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
            
1311

    
    (2)  A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant
            
1312

    
in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:
            
1313

    
    (a)  All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.
            
1314

    
    (b)  The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of
            
1315

    
the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten
            
1316

    
days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid
            
1317

    
within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time

            
1318


    
and place.
            
1319

    
    (c)  The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.
            
1320

    
    (d)  The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or
            
1321

    
stored.
            
1322

    
    (e)  After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the
            
1323

    
sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general
            
1324

    
circulation where the sale is to be held.  The advertisement must include a description of the
            
1325

    
goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and
            
1326

    
place of the sale.  The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first publication.  If there is
            
1327

    
no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be
            
1328

    
posted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six conspicuous places in the
            
1329

    
neighborhood of the proposed sale.
            
1330

    
    (3)  Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods
            
1331

    
may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in
            
1332

    
complying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by
            
1333

    
the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this chapter.
            
1334

    
    (4)  A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.
            
1335

    
    (5)  A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the
            
1336

    
goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's
            
1337

    
noncompliance with this section.
            
1338

    
    (6)  A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this
            
1339

    
section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the
            
1340

    
warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.
            
1341

    
    (7)  The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law
            
1342

    
to a creditor against a debtor.
            
1343

    
    (8)  If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may
            
1344

    
be enforced in accordance with Subsection (1) or (2).
            
1345

    
    (9)  A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the

            
1346


    
requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for
            
1347

    
conversion.

1351

    
 "Shipper's weight, load, and count" -- Improper handling.
            
1352

    
    (1)  A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith,
            
1353

    
or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of
            
1354

    
the goods in the bill or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages
            
1355

    
caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to
            
1356

    
the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the
            
1357

    
goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the
            
1358

    
description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or
            
1359

    
description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown," "said to
            
1360

    
contain," "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import, if that indication is
            
1361

    
true.
            
1362

    
    (2)  If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:
            
1363

    
    (a)  the issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the
            
1364

    
kind and quantity if shipped in bulk; and
            
1365

    
    (b)  words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count," or words of similar import
            
1366

    
indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods
            
1367

    
concealed in packages.
            
1368

    
    (3)  If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of
            
1369

    
lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and
            
1370

    
quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so.  In
            
1371

    
that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective.
            
1372

    
    (4)  The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight,
            
1373

    
load, and count," or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the

            
1374


    
shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the
            
1375

    
improper loading.  However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages
            
1376

    
caused by improper loading.
            
1377

    
    (5)  A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the
            
1378

    
description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the
            
1379

    
shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in
            
1380

    
those particulars.  This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer's responsibility or liability
            
1381

    
under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

    (1)  Except as customary in international transportation, a tangible bill of lading may
            
1426

    
not be issued in a set of parts.  The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this
            
1427

    
Subsection (1).
            
1428

    
    (2)  If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which contains
            
1429

    
an identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered

    (3)  If a tangible negotiable bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and different
            
1432

    
parts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiation
            
1433

    
is made prevails as to both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder may
            
1434

    
have received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier's obligation by
            
1435

    
surrendering its part.

    (4)  A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issued

1456

    
     70A-7a-307.  Lien of carrier.
            
1457

    
    (1)  A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds

            
1458


    
thereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier's receipt of the goods for
            
1459

    
storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses
            
1460

    
necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in
            
1461

    
their sale pursuant to law.  However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading,
            
1462

    
a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges
            
1463

    
are stated, a reasonable charge.
            
1464

    
    (2)  A lien for charges and expenses under Subsection (1) on goods that the carrier was
            
1465

    
required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person
            
1466

    
entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject
            
1467

    
the goods to those charges and expenses.  Any other lien under Subsection (1) is effective
            
1468

    
against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession of
            
1469

    
the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.
            
1470

    
    (3)  A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably
            
1471

    
refuses to deliver.
            
1472

    
    Section 45.  
Section  
70A-7a-308

 is enacted to read:
            
1473

    
     70A-7a-308.  Enforcement of carrier's lien.
            
1474

    
    (1)  A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in
            
1475

    
bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable,
            
1476

    
after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification must
            
1477

    
include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place
            
1478

    
of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different
            
1479

    
time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to
            
1480

    
establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sells
            
1481

    
goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in
            
1482

    
any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale,
            
1483

    
or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the
            
1484

    
type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure
            
1485

    
satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the

            
1486


    
preceding sentence.
            
1487

    
    (2)  Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods
            
1488

    
may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in
            
1489

    
complying with this section.  In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by
            
1490

    
the carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this chapter.
            
1491

    
    (3)  A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.
            
1492

    
    (4)  A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods
            
1493

    
free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier's
            
1494

    
noncompliance with this section.
            
1495

    
    (5)  A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section
            
1496

    
but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier
            
1497

    
would have been bound to deliver the goods.
            
1498

    
    (6)  The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law
            
1499

    
to a creditor against a debtor.
            
1500

    
    (7)  A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either Subsection (1) or the procedure
            
1501

    
set forth in Subsection 

70A-7a-210

(2).
            
1502

    
    (8)  A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements
            
1503

    
for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.
            
1504

    
    Section 46.  
Section  
70A-7a-309

 is enacted to read:
            
1505

    
     70A-7a-309.  Duty of care -- Contractual limitation of carrier's liability.
            
1506

    
    (1)  A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall
            
1507

    
exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would
            
1508

    
exercise under similar circumstances.  This Subsection (1) does not affect any statute,
            
1509

    
regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused
            
1510

    
by its negligence.
            
1511

    
    (2)  Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation
            
1512

    
agreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation
            
1513

    
agreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an

            
1514


    
opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity. 
            
1515

    
However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion
            
1516

    
to its own use.
            
1517

    
    (3)  Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and
            
1518

    
commencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a
            
1519

    
transportation agreement.

1526

    
statute, rule, or regulation regarding its issuance, form, or content;
            
1527

    
    (2)  the issuer violated laws regulating the conduct of its business;

    (3)  the goods covered by the document were owned by the bailee when the document
            
1529

    
was issued; or

    A duplicate or any other document of title purporting to cover goods already

represented by an outstanding document of the same issuer does not confer any right in the

person complies with Subsections (2) and (3), unless and to the extent that the bailee
            
1544

1545

    
    (a)  delivery of the goods to a person whose receipt was rightful as against the claimant;
            
1546

    
    (b)  damage to or delay, loss, or destruction of the goods for which the bailee is not

liable;
            
1548

    
    (c)  previous sale or other disposition of the goods in lawful enforcement of a lien or on

    (f)  release, satisfaction, or any other personal defense against the claimant; or
            
1554

    
    (g)  any other lawful excuse.
            
1555

    
    (2)  A person claiming goods covered by a document of title shall satisfy the bailee's
            
1556

    
lien if the bailee so requests or if the bailee is prohibited by law from delivering the goods until
            
1557

    
the charges are paid.
            
1558

    
    (3)  Unless a person claiming the goods is a person against which the document of title

1576

    
     70A-7a-501.  Form of negotiation and requirements of due negotiation.
            
1577

    
    (1)  The following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title:
            
1578

    
    (a)  If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is
            
1579

    
negotiated by the named person's indorsement and delivery.  After the named person's
            
1580

    
indorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.
            
1581

    
    (b)  If the document's original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.
            
1582

    
    (c)  If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is
            
1583

    
delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.
            
1584

    
    (d)  Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires
            
1585

    
indorsement by the named person and delivery.
            
1586

    
    (e)  A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this
            
1587

    
Subsection (1) to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against
            
1588

    
or claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the
            
1589

    
negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the
            
1590

    
document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.
            
1591

    
    (2)  The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:
            
1592

    
    (a)  If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the
            
1593

    
document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person.  Indorsement by the
            
1594

    
named person is not required to negotiate the document.
            
1595

    
    (b)  If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and the named
            
1596

    
person has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been
            
1597

    
negotiated.

            
1598


    
    (c)  A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this
            
1599

    
subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or
            
1600

    
claim to it on the part of any person, and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation
            
1601

    
is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the document
            
1602

    
in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.
            
1603

    
    (3)  Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document of title neither makes it negotiable nor
            
1604

    
adds to the transferee's rights.
            
1605

    
    (4)  The naming in a negotiable bill of lading of a person to be notified of the arrival of
            
1606

    
the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the

bill of any interest of that person in the goods.
