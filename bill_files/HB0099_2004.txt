If the revision of the Indexchanges the Reference Base Index, a revised Reference Base Index must be determined bymultiplying the Reference Base Index then applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by theBureau of Labor Statistics.

Those allocations may not discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant or an affiliateof the declarant.(3)  If units may be added to or withdrawn from the common interest community, thedeclaration must state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among allunits included in the common interest community after the addition or withdrawal.(4) (a)  The declaration may provide:(i)  that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units on particular mattersspecified in the declaration;(ii)  for cumulative voting only for the purpose of electing members of the executiveboard; and(iii)  for class voting on specified issues affecting the class if necessary to protect validinterests of the class.(b)  A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evadingany limitation imposed on declarants by this chapter nor may units constitute a class becausethey are owned by a declarant.(5)  Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expenseliabilities and, in a condominium, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elementsallocated at any time to all the units must each equal one if stated as a fraction or 100% ifstated as a percentage.  In the event of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the resultderived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.(6)  In a condominium, the common elements are not subject to partition, and anypurported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer ofan undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest isallocated is void.(7)  In a cooperative, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or othervoluntary or involuntary transfer of an ownership interest in the association made without thepossessory interest in the unit to which that interest is related is void.    57-8a-308.(1)  Except for the limited common elements described in Subsections

If the owners of the adjoining unitshave specified a reallocation between their units of their allocated interests, the applicationmust state the proposed reallocations.  Unless the executive board determines, within 30 days,that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association shall prepare an amendment thatidentifies the units involved and states the reallocations.  The amendment must be executed bythose unit owners, contain words of conveyance between them, and, on recordation, be indexedin the name of the grantor and the grantee, and in the grantee's index in the name of theassociation.(2)  Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, boundariesbetween units and common elements may be relocated to incorporate common elements withina unit by an amendment to the declaration upon application to the association by the owner ofthe unit who proposes to relocate a boundary.  Unless the declaration provides otherwise, theamendment may be approved only if persons entitled to cast at least 67% of the votes in theassociation, including 67% of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree tothe action.  The amendment may describe any fees or charges payable by the owner of theaffected unit in connection with the boundary relocation and the fees and charges are assets ofthe association.

The agreement is effective 30 days after an amendment to the declarationreflecting the terms of the agreement is recorded unless all the persons holding the affectedspecial declarant rights, or security interests in those rights, record a written objection withinthe 30-day period, in which case the amendment is void, or consent in writing at the time theamendment is recorded, in which case the amendment is effective when recorded.    57-8a-318.(1)  Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain or in the case offoreclosure against an entire cooperative of a security interest that has priority over thedeclaration, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unitowners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any largerpercentage the declaration specifies.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only ifall of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.(2)  An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a terminationagreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number ofunit owners.  The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will bevoid unless it is recorded before that date.  A termination agreement and all ratifications thereofmust be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community issituated and is effective only upon recordation.(3)  In the case of a condominium or planned community containing only units havinghorizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide thatall of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be soldfollowing termination.  If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interestcommunity is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth theminimum terms of the sale.(4)  In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units nothaving horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement mayprovide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold followingtermination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all the unitowners consent to the sale.(5)  The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of realestate in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners untilapproved pursuant to Subsections (1) and (2).  If any real estate is to be sold followingtermination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for theholders of all interests in the units.  Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary andappropriate to effect the sale.  Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereofdistributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests mayappear, in accordance with Subsections (8), (9), and (10).  Unless otherwise specified in thetermination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit ownerand the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portionof the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.  During the period of that occupancy, eachunit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments andother obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.(6)  In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate constituting thecommon interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to the commonelements and, in a common interest community containing only units having horizontalboundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the common interestcommunity, vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion totheir respective interests as provided in Subsection (10), and liens on the units shiftaccordingly.  While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the unit owner'ssuccessors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate thatformerly constituted the unit.(7)  Following termination of the common interest community, the proceeds of any saleof real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trusteefor unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.(8)  Following termination of a condominium or planned community, creditors of theassociation holding liens on the units, which were recorded before termination, may enforcethose liens in the same manner as any lien holder.  All other creditors of the association are tobe treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.(9) (a)  In a cooperative, the declaration may provide that all creditors of the associationhave priority over any interests of unit owners and creditors of unit owners.  In that event,following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which wererecorded before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lien holder, andany other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against thecooperative immediately before termination.  Unless the declaration provides that all creditorsof the association have that priority:(i)  the lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against theassociation before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each unit owner'sinterest in the unit as of the date the lien was perfected;(ii)  any other creditor of the association is to be treated upon termination as if thecreditor had perfected a lien against each unit owner's interest immediately before termination;(iii)  the amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in Subsections (9)(a)(i)and (b) against each of the unit owners' interest must be proportionate to the ratio which eachunit's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the units;(iv)  the lien of each creditor of each unit owner which was perfected before terminationcontinues as a lien against that unit owner's unit as of the date the lien was perfected; and(v)  the assets of the association must be distributed to all unit owners and all lienholders as their interests may appear in the order described above.(b)   Creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any unit owner inexcess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that unit owner's interest.(10)  The respective interests of unit owners referred to in Subsections (5) through (9)are as follows:(a)  Except as provided in Subsection (10)(b), the respective interests of unit owners arethe fair market values of their units, allocated interests, and any limited common elementsimmediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisersselected by the association.  The decision of the independent appraisers must be distributed tothe unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unitowners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated.  The proportion ofany unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair marketvalue of that unit owner's unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all theunits and their allocated interests.(b)  If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that anappraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of allunit owners are:(i)  in a condominium, their respective common element interests immediately beforethe termination;(ii)  in a cooperative, their respective ownership interests immediately before thetermination; and(iii)  in a planned community, their respective common expense liabilities immediatelybefore the termination.(11)  In a condominium or planned community, except as provided in Subsection (12),foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interestcommunity does not terminate, of itself, the common interest community, and foreclosure orenforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community,other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the common interestcommunity.  Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable realestate, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by theassociation under Section 

57-8a-412

, does not withdraw, of itself, that real estate from thecommon interest community, but the person taking title thereto may require from theassociation, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the common interestcommunity.(12)  In a condominium or planned community, if a lien or encumbrance against aportion of the real estate comprising the common interest community has priority over thedeclaration and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosingthe lien or encumbrance, upon foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real estatesubject to that lien or encumbrance from the common interest community.    57-8a-319.(1)  The declaration may require that all or a specified number or percentage of thelenders who hold security interests encumbering the units or who have extended credit to theassociation approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to theeffectiveness of those actions, but no requirement for approval may operate to:(a)  deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association bythe unit owners or the executive board;(b)  prevent the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in, orsettling any litigation or proceeding; or(c)  prevent any insurance trustee or the association from receiving and distributing anyinsurance proceeds except pursuant to Section

.(2)  A lender who has extended credit to an association secured by an assignment ofincome or an encumbrance on the common elements may enforce its security agreement inaccordance with its terms, subject to the requirements of this chapter and other law. Requirements that the association must deposit its periodic common charges before defaultwith the lender to which the association's income has been assigned, or increase its commoncharges at the lender's direction by amounts reasonably necessary to amortize the loan inaccordance with its terms, do not violate the prohibitions on lender approval contained inSubsection (1).    57-8a-320.(1)  If the declaration provides that any of the powers described in Section

    (1)  If a unit is acquired by eminent domain or part of a unit is acquired by eminent
            
306

    
domain leaving the unit owner with a remnant that may not practically or lawfully be used for

            
307


    
any purpose permitted by the declaration, the award must include compensation to the unit
            
308

    
owner for that unit and its allocated interests, whether or not any common elements are
            
309

    
acquired.  Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, that unit's allocated interests
            
310

    
are automatically reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective allocated
            
311

    
interests of those units before the taking, and the association shall promptly prepare, execute,
            
312

    
and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.  Any remnant of a unit
            
313

    
remaining after part of a unit is taken under this Subsection (1) is thereafter a common element.

    (2)  Except as provided in Subsection (1), if part of a unit is acquired by eminent
            
315

    
domain, the award must compensate the unit owner for the reduction in value of the unit and its
            
316

    
interest in the common elements, whether or not any common elements are acquired.  Upon
            
317

    
acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides:
            
318

    
    (a)  that unit's allocated interests are reduced in proportion to the reduction in the size of
            
319

    
the unit, or on any other basis specified in the declaration; and
            
320

    
    (b)  the portion of the allocated interests divested from the partially acquired unit are
            
321

    
automatically reallocated to that unit and to the remaining units in proportion to the respective
            
322

    
allocated interests of those units before the taking, with the partially acquired unit participating
            
323

    
in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced allocated interests.
            
324

    
    (3)  If part of the common elements is acquired by eminent domain, the portion of the
            
325

    
award attributable to the common elements taken must be paid to the association.  Unless the
            
326

    
declaration provides otherwise, any portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a
            
327

    
limited common element must be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that
            
328

    
limited common element was allocated at the time of acquisition.
            
329

    
    (4)  The court decree must be recorded in every county in which any portion of the
            
330

    
common interest community is located.

    (1)  The court, upon finding as a matter of law that a contract or contract clause was

unconscionable at the time the contract was made, may refuse to enforce the contract, enforce
            
357

    
the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or limit the application of any
            
358

    
unconscionable clause in order to avoid an unconscionable result.
            
359

    
    (2) (a)  Whenever it is claimed, or appears to the court, that a contract or any contract

Items 1967 = 100, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of
            
391

    
Labor, (the "Index").  The Index for December, 1979, which was 230, is the Reference Base

395

    
change, calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Index at the end of the

402

    
    (c)  in no event may the dollar amount be reduced below the amount appearing in this
            
403

    (3)  If the Index is revised after December, 1979, the percentage of change pursuant to
            
405

    
this section must be calculated on the basis of the revised Index.  If the revision of the Index
            
406

    
changes the Reference Base Index, a revised Reference Base Index must be determined by
            
407

    
multiplying the Reference Base Index then applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the

 is enacted to read:
            
604

    
     57-8a-306.  Leasehold common interest communities.
            
605

    
    (1)  Any lease the expiration or termination of which may terminate the common
            
606

    
interest community or reduce its size, or a memorandum thereof, must be recorded.  Every
            
607

    
lessor of those leases in a condominium or planned community shall sign the declaration.  The
            
608

    
declaration must state:
            
609

    
    (a)  the recording data for the lease or a statement of where the complete lease may be
            
610

    
inspected;
            
611

    
    (b)  the date on which the lease is scheduled to expire;
            
612

    
    (c)  a legally sufficient description of the real estate subject to the lease;
            
613

    
    (d)  any right of the unit owners to redeem the reversion and the manner whereby those
            
614

    
rights may be exercised, or a statement that they do not have those rights;
            
615

    
    (e)  any right of the unit owners to remove any improvements within a reasonable time
            
616

    
after the expiration or termination of the lease, or a statement that they do not have those rights;

            
617


    
and

    (f)  any rights of the unit owners to renew the lease and the conditions of any renewal,
            
619

    
or a statement that they do not have those rights.
            
620

    
    (2)  After the declaration for a leasehold condominium or leasehold planned community
            
621

    
is recorded, neither the lessor nor the lessor's successor in interest may terminate the leasehold
            
622

    
interest of a unit owner who makes timely payment of a unit owner's share of the rent and
            
623

    
otherwise complies with all covenants which, if violated, would entitle the lessor to terminate
            
624

    
the lease.  A unit owner's leasehold interest in a condominium or planned community is not
            
625

    
affected by failure of any other person to pay rent or fulfill any other covenant.
            
626

    
    (3)  Acquisition of the leasehold interest of any unit owner by the owner of the
            
627

    
reversion or remainder does not merge the leasehold and fee simple interests unless the
            
628

    
leasehold interests of all unit owners subject to that reversion or remainder are acquired.
            
629

    
    (4)  If the expiration or termination of a lease decreases the number of units in a
            
630

    
common interest community, the allocated interests must be reallocated in accordance with
            
631

    
Subsection 

57-8a-107

(1) as if those units had been taken by eminent domain.  Reallocations
            
632

    
must be confirmed by an amendment to the declaration prepared, executed, and recorded by the
            
633

    
association.

    Section 31.  
Section  
57-8a-307

 is enacted to read:
            
635

    
     57-8a-307.  Allocation of allocated interests.
            
636

    
    (1)  The declaration must allocate to each unit:
            
637

    
    (a)  in a condominium, a fraction or percentage of undivided interests in the common
            
638

    
elements and in the common expenses of the association, and a portion of the votes in the
            
639

    
association;
            
640

    
    (b)  in a cooperative, an ownership interest in the association, a fraction or percentage
            
641

    
of the common expenses of the association, and a portion of the votes in the association; and
            
642

    
    (c)  in a planned community, a fraction or percentage of the common expenses of the
            
643

    
association, and a portion of the votes in the association.
            
644

    
    (2)  The declaration must state the formulas used to establish allocations of interests. 
            
645

    
Those allocations may not discriminate in favor of units owned by the declarant or an affiliate
            
646

    
of the declarant.
            
647

    
    (3)  If units may be added to or withdrawn from the common interest community, the

            
648


    
declaration must state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among all
            
649

    
units included in the common interest community after the addition or withdrawal.
            
650

    
    (4) (a)  The declaration may provide:
            
651

    
    (i)  that different allocations of votes shall be made to the units on particular matters
            
652

    
specified in the declaration;
            
653

    
    (ii)  for cumulative voting only for the purpose of electing members of the executive
            
654

    
board; and
            
655

    
    (iii)  for class voting on specified issues affecting the class if necessary to protect valid
            
656

    
interests of the class.
            
657

    
    (b)  A declarant may not utilize cumulative or class voting for the purpose of evading
            
658

    
any limitation imposed on declarants by this chapter nor may units constitute a class because
            
659

    
they are owned by a declarant.
            
660

    
    (5)  Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the common expense
            
661

    
liabilities and, in a condominium, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elements
            
662

    
allocated at any time to all the units must each equal one if stated as a fraction or 100% if
            
663

    
stated as a percentage.  In the event of discrepancy between an allocated interest and the result
            
664

    
derived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.
            
665

    
    (6)  In a condominium, the common elements are not subject to partition, and any
            
666

    
purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of
            
667

    
an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is
            
668

    
allocated is void.
            
669

    
    (7)  In a cooperative, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale, or other
            
670

    
voluntary or involuntary transfer of an ownership interest in the association made without the
            
671

    
possessory interest in the unit to which that interest is related is void.
            
672

    
    Section 32.

57-8a-308

 is enacted to read:

    (1)  Except for the limited common elements described in Subsections 

57-8a-302

(2)
            
675

    
and (4), the declaration must specify to which unit or units each limited common element is
            
676

    
allocated.  An allocation may not be altered without the consent of the unit owners whose units
            
677

    
are affected.
            
678

    
    (2)  Except as the declaration otherwise provides, a limited common element may be

            
679


    
reallocated by an amendment to the declaration executed by the unit owners between or among
            
680

    
whose units the reallocation is made.  The persons executing the amendment shall provide a
            
681

    
copy thereof to the association, which shall record it.  The amendment must be recorded in the
            
682

    
names of the parties and the common interest community.
            
683

    
    (3)  A common element not previously allocated as a limited common element may be
            
684

    
so allocated only pursuant to provisions in the declaration made in accordance with Subsection
            
685

condominium or planned community comply with Section 

57-8a-309

.  The declarant is the unit
            
753

    
owner of any units thereby created.  The amendment to the declaration must assign an
            
754

    
identifying number to each new unit created, and, except in the case of subdivision or
            
755

    
conversion of units described in Subsection (2), reallocate the allocated interests among all

declaration pursuant to Subsection 

57-8a-305

(1)(h).

    (3)  Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit
            
766

    
previously created into additional units, common elements, or both:
            
767

    
    (a)  if the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to
            
768

    
the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of that unit among the other units as if
            
769

    
that unit had been taken by eminent domain; and

    (b)  if the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether or not any part
            
771

    
of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration must

            
772


    
reallocate all the allocated interests of the unit among the units created by the subdivision in
            
773

    
any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.
            
774

    
    (4)  If the declaration provides, pursuant to Subsection 

57-8a-305

(1)(h), that all or a
            
775

    
portion of the real estate is subject to a right of withdrawal:
            
776

    
    (a)  if all the real estate is subject to withdrawal, and the declaration does not describe
            
777

    
separate portions of real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn
            
778

    
after a unit has been conveyed to a purchaser; and
            
779

    
    (b)  if any portion is subject to withdrawal, it may not be withdrawn after a unit in that

    (1)  Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, the
            
800

    
boundaries between adjoining units may be relocated by an amendment to the declaration upon
            
801

    
application to the association by the owners of those units.  If the owners of the adjoining units
            
802

    
have specified a reallocation between their units of their allocated interests, the application

            
803


    
must state the proposed reallocations.  Unless the executive board determines, within 30 days,
            
804

    
that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association shall prepare an amendment that
            
805

    
identifies the units involved and states the reallocations.  The amendment must be executed by
            
806

    
those unit owners, contain words of conveyance between them, and, on recordation, be indexed
            
807

a unit by an amendment to the declaration upon application to the association by the owner of
            
812

    
the unit who proposes to relocate a boundary.  Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the
            
813

    
amendment may be approved only if persons entitled to cast at least 67% of the votes in the
            
814

    
association, including 67% of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree to
            
815

    
the action.  The amendment may describe any fees or charges payable by the owner of the
            
816

    
affected unit in connection with the boundary relocation and the fees and charges are assets of
            
817

    
the association.  The amendment must be executed by the unit owner of the unit whose
            
818

    
boundary is being relocated and by the association, contain words of conveyance between
            
819

825

    
    (b)  in a cooperative shall prepare and record amendments to the declaration, including

831

    
units.  Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, upon application

    (6)  By vote or agreement of unit owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in

            
896


    
the association are allocated, or any larger percentage specified in the declaration, an
            
897

    
amendment to the declaration may prohibit or materially restrict the permitted uses of or
            
898

    
behavior in a unit or the number or other qualifications of persons who may occupy units.  The
            
899

    
amendment must provide reasonable protection for a use or occupancy permitted at the time
            
900

    
the amendment was adopted.
            
901

    
    (7)  The time limits specified in the declaration pursuant to Subsection 

57-8a-305

(1)(h)
            
902

    
within which reserved development rights must be exercised may be extended, and additional
            
903

    
development rights may be created, if persons entitled to cast at least 80% of the votes in the
            
904

    
association, including 80% of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant, agree to
            
905

    
that action.  The agreement is effective 30 days after an amendment to the declaration
            
906

    
reflecting the terms of the agreement is recorded unless all the persons holding the affected
            
907

    
special declarant rights, or security interests in those rights, record a written objection within
            
908

    
the 30-day period, in which case the amendment is void, or consent in writing at the time the

    Section 42.  
Section  
57-8a-318

 is enacted to read:
            
911

    
     57-8a-318.  Termination of common interest community.
            
912

    
    (1)  Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain or in the case of
            
913

    
foreclosure against an entire cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the
            
914

    
declaration, a common interest community may be terminated only by agreement of unit
            
915

    
owners of units to which at least 80% of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger
            
916

    
percentage the declaration specifies.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if
            
917

    
all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
            
918

    
    (2)  An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination
            
919

    
agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of
            
920

    
unit owners.  The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be
            
921

    
void unless it is recorded before that date.  A termination agreement and all ratifications thereof
            
922

    
must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is
            
923

    
situated and is effective only upon recordation.
            
924

    
    (3)  In the case of a condominium or planned community containing only units having
            
925

    
horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may provide that
            
926

    
all of the common elements and units of the common interest community must be sold

            
927


    
following termination.  If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the common interest
            
928

    
community is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement must set forth the
            
929

    
minimum terms of the sale.
            
930

    
    (4)  In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units not
            
931

    
having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, a termination agreement may
            
932

    
provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold following
            
933

    
termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise or all the unit
            
934

    
owners consent to the sale.
            
935

    
    (5)  The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real
            
936

    
estate in a common interest community, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until
            
937

    
approved pursuant to Subsections (1) and (2).  If any real estate is to be sold following
            
938

    
termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the
            
939

    
holders of all interests in the units.  Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and
            
940

    
appropriate to effect the sale.  Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof
            
941

    
distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. 
            
942

    
Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may
            
943

    
appear, in accordance with Subsections (8), (9), and (10).  Unless otherwise specified in the
            
944

    
termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner
            
945

    
and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion
            
946

    
of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.  During the period of that occupancy, each
            
947

    
unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and
            
948

    
other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.
            
949

    
    (6)  In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate constituting the
            
950

    
common interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to the common
            
951

    
elements and, in a common interest community containing only units having horizontal
            
952

    
boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate in the common interest
            
953

    
community, vests in the unit owners upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to
            
954

    
their respective interests as provided in Subsection (10), and liens on the units shift
            
955

    
accordingly.  While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the unit owner's
            
956

    
successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that
            
957

    
formerly constituted the unit.

            
958


    
    (7)  Following termination of the common interest community, the proceeds of any sale
            
959

    
of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee
            
960

    
for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.
            
961

    
    (8)  Following termination of a condominium or planned community, creditors of the
            
962

    
association holding liens on the units, which were recorded before termination, may enforce
            
963

    
those liens in the same manner as any lien holder.  All other creditors of the association are to
            
964

    
be treated as if they had perfected liens on the units immediately before termination.
            
965

    
    (9) (a)  In a cooperative, the declaration may provide that all creditors of the association
            
966

    
have priority over any interests of unit owners and creditors of unit owners.  In that event,
            
967

    
following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative which were
            
968

    
recorded before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lien holder, and
            
969

    
any other creditor of the association is to be treated as if he had perfected a lien against the
            
970

    
cooperative immediately before termination.  Unless the declaration provides that all creditors
            
971

    
of the association have that priority:
            
972

    
    (i)  the lien of each creditor of the association which was perfected against the
            
973

    
association before termination becomes, upon termination, a lien against each unit owner's
            
974

    
interest in the unit as of the date the lien was perfected;
            
975

    
    (ii)  any other creditor of the association is to be treated upon termination as if the
            
976

    
creditor had perfected a lien against each unit owner's interest immediately before termination;
            
977

    
    (iii)  the amount of the lien of an association's creditor described in Subsections (9)(a)(i)
            
978

    
and (b) against each of the unit owners' interest must be proportionate to the ratio which each
            
979

    
unit's common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all of the units;
            
980

    
    (iv)  the lien of each creditor of each unit owner which was perfected before termination
            
981

    
continues as a lien against that unit owner's unit as of the date the lien was perfected; and
            
982

    
    (v)  the assets of the association must be distributed to all unit owners and all lien
            
983

    
holders as their interests may appear in the order described above.
            
984

    
    (b)   Creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any unit owner in
            
985

    
excess of the amount of the creditor's lien against that unit owner's interest.
            
986

    
    (10)  The respective interests of unit owners referred to in Subsections (5) through (9)
            
987

    
are as follows:
            
988

    
    (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (10)(b), the respective interests of unit owners are

            
989


    
the fair market values of their units, allocated interests, and any limited common elements
            
990

    
immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers
            
991

    
selected by the association.  The decision of the independent appraisers must be distributed to
            
992

    
the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit
            
993

    
owners of units to which 25% of the votes in the association are allocated.  The proportion of
            
994

    
any unit owner's interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market
            
995

    
value of that unit owner's unit and its allocated interests by the total fair market values of all the
            
996

    
units and their allocated interests.
            
997

    
    (b)  If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an
            
998

    
appraisal of the fair market value thereof before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all
            
999

    
unit owners are:
            
1000

    
    (i)  in a condominium, their respective common element interests immediately before
            
1001

    
the termination;
            
1002

    
    (ii)  in a cooperative, their respective ownership interests immediately before the
            
1003

    
termination; and
            
1004

    
    (iii)  in a planned community, their respective common expense liabilities immediately
            
1005

    
before the termination.
            
1006

    
    (11)  In a condominium or planned community, except as provided in Subsection (12),
            
1007

    
foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire common interest
            
1008

    
community does not terminate, of itself, the common interest community, and foreclosure or
            
1009

    
enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the common interest community,
            
1010

    
other than withdrawable real estate, does not withdraw that portion from the common interest
            
1011

    
community.  Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real
            
1012

    
estate, or against common elements that have been subjected to a security interest by the
            
1013

    
association under Section 

57-8a-412

, does not withdraw, of itself, that real estate from the
            
1014

    
common interest community, but the person taking title thereto may require from the
            
1015

    
association, upon request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the common interest
            
1016

    
community.
            
1017

    
    (12)  In a condominium or planned community, if a lien or encumbrance against a
            
1018

    
portion of the real estate comprising the common interest community has priority over the
            
1019

    
declaration and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing

            
1020


    
the lien or encumbrance, upon foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real estate
            
1021

    
subject to that lien or encumbrance from the common interest community.

lenders who hold security interests encumbering the units or who have extended credit to the
            
1026

    
association approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the
            
1027

    
effectiveness of those actions, but no requirement for approval may operate to:
            
1028

    
    (a)  deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association by
            
1029

    
the unit owners or the executive board;
            
1030

    
    (b)  prevent the association or the executive board from commencing, intervening in, or
            
1031

    
settling any litigation or proceeding; or

insurance proceeds except pursuant to Section

.

income or an encumbrance on the common elements may enforce its security agreement in

board may delegate certain powers to a master association, the members of the executive board
            
1057

    
have no liability for the acts or omissions of the master association with respect to those

    (4)  The rights and responsibilities of unit owners with respect to the unit owners'

    (1)  Any two or more common interest communities of the same form of ownership, by
            
1081

    
agreement of the unit owners as provided in Subsection (2), may be merged or consolidated

            
1082


    
into a single common interest community.  In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the
            
1083

    
agreement otherwise provides, the resultant common interest community is the legal successor,
            
1084

    
for all purposes, of all of the preexisting common interest communities, and the operations and
            
1085

    
activities of all associations of the preexisting common interest communities are merged or
            
1086

    
consolidated into a single association that holds all powers, rights, obligations, assets, and

interest communities following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the
            
1092

    
percentage of votes in each common interest community required to terminate that common
            
1093

    
interest community.  The agreement must be recorded in every county in which a portion of the

allocated interests in the new association among the units of the resultant common interest
            
1097

    
community either:

    (a)  by stating the reallocations or the formulas upon which they are based; or

1200

    
may adopt rules and regulations that affect the use of or behavior in units that may be used for

    (4)  If a tenant of a unit owner violates the declaration, bylaws, or rules and regulations
            
1212

    
of the association, in addition to exercising any of its powers against the unit owner, the
            
1213

    
association may:

    (b)  after giving notice to the tenant and the unit owner and an opportunity to be heard,
            
1216

    
levy reasonable fines against the tenant for the violation; and
            
1217

    
    (c)  enforce any other rights against the tenant for the violation which the unit owner as
            
1218

have exercised directly against the unit owner, or both.

under other law; or
            
1226

majority of all unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration reject the budget, the
            
1247

1248

    
rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the unit owners must be continued until such time
            
1249

    
as the unit owners ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the executive board.

    (b)  A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and

1283

    
     57-8a-404.  Transfer of special declarant rights.
            
1284

    
    (1)  A special declarant right created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred
            
1285

    
only by an instrument evidencing the transfer recorded in every county in which any portion of
            
1286

    
the common interest community is located.  The instrument is not effective unless executed by
            
1287

    
the transferee.
            
1288

    
    (2)  Upon transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is
            
1289

1290

    
    (a)  A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer
            
1291

    
and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon him by this chapter.  Lack of privity
            
1292

    
does not deprive any unit owner of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of
            
1293

    
the transferor.
            
1294

    
    (b)  If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the
            
1295

    
transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of
            
1296

    
the successor relating to the common interest community.
            
1297

    
    (c)  If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special
            
1298

    
declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for

            
1299


    
any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration
            
1300

    
relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising after the transfer.

    (1)  Except to the extent provided by the declaration, Subsection (2), or Subsection
            
1398

    


57-8a-413

(8), the association is responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement of the
            
1399

    
common elements, and each unit owner is responsible for maintenance, repair, and replacement
            
1400

    
of his unit.  Each unit owner shall afford to the association and the other unit owners, and to
            
1401

    
their agents or employees, access through his unit reasonably necessary for those purposes.  If

    (2)  In addition to the liability that a declarant as a unit owner has under this chapter, the
            
1406

    
declarant alone is liable for all expenses in connection with real estate subject to development
            
1407

that owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that unit.  If more than one of the owners
            
1437

    
are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement
            
1438

    
of a majority in interest of the owners, unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise.

There is majority agreement if any one of the owners casts the votes allocated to that unit

without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the
            
1441

    
other owners of the unit.
            
1442

    
    (2)  Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit

unit owner may revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section only by actual notice of
            
1446

    
revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association.  A proxy is void if it is not

dated or purports to be revocable without notice.  A proxy terminates one year after its date,
            
1448

    
unless it specifies a shorter term.

    (3) (a)  If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the common
            
1450

    
interest community be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units:

    (i)  the provisions of Subsections (1) and (2) apply to lessees as if they were unit
            
1452

1453

    
    (ii)  unit owners who have leased their units to other persons may not cast votes on

    (iii)  lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records, and other rights
            
1456

    
respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.
            
1457

    
    (b)  Unit owners must also be given notice, in the manner provided in Section

    (1)  A unit owner is not liable, solely by reason of being a unit owner, for an injury or
            
1463

    
damage arising out of the condition or use of the common elements.  Neither the association
            
1464

    
nor any unit owner except the declarant is liable for that declarant's torts in connection with any
            
1465

    
part of the common interest community which that declarant has the responsibility to maintain.
            
1466

    
    (2) (a)  An action alleging a wrong done by the association, including an action arising
            
1467

    
out of the condition or use of the common elements, may be maintained only against the
            
1468

    
association and not against any unit owner.  If the wrong occurred during any period of
            
1469

    
declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an
            
1470

    
opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is
            
1471

    
liable to the association or to any unit owner for:
            
1472

    
    (i)  all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or that unit
            
1473

    
owner; and
            
1474

    
    (ii)  all costs that the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or
            
1475

    
other wrongful act or omission.
            
1476

    
    (b)  Whenever the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant
            
1477

    
is also liable for all expenses of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the
            
1478

    
association.
            
1479

    
    (3)  Any statute of limitation affecting the association's right of action against a
            
1480

    
declarant under this chapter is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates.  A unit
            
1481

    
owner is not precluded from maintaining an action contemplated by this section because he is a
            
1482

    
unit owner or a member or officer of the association.  Liens resulting from judgments against
            
1483

    
the association are governed by Section

    (1)  In a condominium or planned community, portions of the common elements may
            
1487

    
be conveyed or subjected to a security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at
            
1488

    
least 80% of the votes in the association, including 80% of the votes allocated to units not
            
1489

    
owned by a declarant, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action;
            
1490

    
but all owners of units to which any limited common element is allocated must agree in order
            
1491

    
to convey that limited common element or subject it to a security interest.  The declaration may
            
1492

    
specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential
            
1493

    
uses.  Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the association, but the proceeds of the sale of limited
            
1494

    
common elements must be distributed equitably among the owners of units to which the
            
1495

    
limited common elements were allocated.
            
1496

    
    (2)  Part of a cooperative may be conveyed and all or part of a cooperative may be

votes in the association, including 80% of the votes allocated to units not owned by a declarant,
            
1499

    
or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action; but, if fewer than all of
            
1500

    
the units or limited common elements are to be conveyed or subjected to a security interest,
            
1501

    
then all unit owners of those units, or the units to which those limited common elements are
            
1502

    
allocated, must agree in order to convey those units or limited common elements or subject
            
1503

    
them to a security interest.  The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the
            
1504

    
units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.  Proceeds of the sale are an asset of the
            
1505

    
association.  Any purported conveyance or other voluntary transfer of an entire cooperative,
            
1506

    
unless made pursuant to Section 

57-8a-318

, is void.
            
1507

    
    (3)  An agreement to convey common elements in a condominium or planned
            
1508

    
community, or to subject them to a security interest, or in a cooperative, an agreement to
            
1509

    
convey any part of a cooperative or subject it to a security interest, must be evidenced by the
            
1510

    
execution of an agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the
            
1511

    
requisite number of unit owners.  The agreement must specify a date after which the agreement
            
1512

    
will be void unless recorded before that date.  The agreement and all ratifications thereof must
            
1513

    
be recorded in every county in which a portion of the common interest community is situated,
            
1514

    
and is effective only upon recordation.
            
1515

    
    (4)  The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract to convey an interest in

            
1516


    
a common interest community pursuant to Subsection (1), but the contract is not enforceable
            
1517

    
against the association until approved pursuant to Subsections (1), (2), and (3).  Thereafter, the
            
1518

    
association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance,
            
1519

    
including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.
            
1520

    
    (5)  Unless made pursuant to this section, any purported conveyance, encumbrance,
            
1521

    
judicial sale, or other voluntary transfer of common elements or of any other part of a
            
1522

    
cooperative is void.
            
1523

    
    (6)  A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements or of a cooperative pursuant to
            
1524

    
this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support.
            
1525

    
    (7)  Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if the holders of first security interests
            
1526

    
on 80% of the units that are subject to security interests on the day the unit owners' agreement
            
1527

    
under Subsection (3) is recorded consent in writing:
            
1528

    
    (a)  a conveyance of common elements pursuant to this section terminates both the
            
1529

    
undivided interests in those common elements allocated to the units and the security interests in
            
1530

    
those undivided interests held by all persons holding security interests in the units; and
            
1531

    
    (b)  an encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section has priority over all
            
1532

    
preexisting encumbrances on the undivided interests in those common elements held by all
            
1533

    
persons holding security interests in the units.
            
1534

    
    (8)  The consents by holders of first security interests on units described in Subsection
            
1535

    
(7), or a certificate of the secretary affirming that those consents have been received by the
            
1536

    
association, may be recorded at any time before the date on which the agreement under
            
1537

    
Subsection (3) becomes void.  Consents or certificates so recorded are valid from the date they
            
1538

    
are recorded for purposes of calculating the percentage of consenting first security interest
            
1539

    
holders, regardless of later sales or encumbrances on those units.  Even if the required
            
1540

    
percentage of first security interest holders so consent, a conveyance or encumbrance of
            
1541

    
common elements does not affect interests having priority over the declaration, or created by
            
1542

    
the association after the declaration was recorded.
            
1543

    
    (9)  In a cooperative, the association may acquire, hold, encumber, or convey a
            
1544

    
proprietary lease without complying with this section.

    Section 60.  
Section  
57-8a-413

 is enacted to read:
            
1546

    
     57-8a-413.  Insurance.

            
1547


    
    (1)  Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person
            
1548

    
other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available:
            
1549

    
    (a)  property insurance on the common elements and, in a planned community, also on
            
1550

    
property that must become common elements, insuring against all risks of direct physical loss
            
1551

    
commonly insured against or, in the case of a conversion building, against fire and extended
            
1552

    
coverage perils; the total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles must be not
            
1553

    
less than 80% of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is
            
1554

    
purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other
            
1555

    
items normally excluded from property policies; and
            
1556

    
    (b)  liability insurance, including medical payments insurance, in an amount determined
            
1557

    
by the executive board but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all
            
1558

    
occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury, and property damage arising
            
1559

    
out of or in connection with the use, ownership, or maintenance of the common elements and,
            
1560

    
in cooperatives, also of all units.
            
1561

    
    (2)  In the case of a building that is part of a cooperative or that contains units having
            
1562

    
horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, the insurance maintained under Subsection
            
1563

    
(1)(a), to the extent reasonably available, must include the units, but need not include
            
1564

    
improvements and betterments installed by unit owners.
            
1565

    
    (3)  If the insurance described in Subsections (1) and (2) is not reasonably available, the
            
1566

    
association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by
            
1567

    
United States mail to all unit owners.  The declaration may require the association to carry any
            
1568

    
other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it considers
            
1569

    
appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.
            
1570

    
    (4)  Insurance policies carried pursuant to Subsections (1) and (2) must provide that:
            
1571

    
    (a)  each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability
            
1572

    
arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association;
            
1573

    
    (b)  the insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner
            
1574

    
or member of his household;
            
1575

    
    (c)  no act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority
            
1576

    
on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy;
            
1577

    
and

            
1578


    
    (d)  if, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a
            
1579

    
unit owner covering the same risk covered by the policy, the association's policy provides
            
1580

    
primary insurance.
            
1581

    
    (5)  Any loss covered by the property policy under Subsections (1)(a) and (2) must be
            
1582

    
adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any
            
1583

    
insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any
            
1584

    
holder of a security interest.  The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance
            
1585

    
proceeds in trust for the association, unit owners, and lien holders as their interests may appear. 
            
1586

    
Subject to the provisions of Subsection (8), the proceeds must be disbursed first for the repair
            
1587

    
or restoration of the damaged property, and the association, unit owners, and lien holders are
            
1588

    
not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of
            
1589

    
proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored, or the common interest
            
1590

    
community is terminated.
            
1591

    
    (6)  An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from
            
1592

    
obtaining insurance for his own benefit.
            
1593

    
    (7)  An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue
            
1594

    
certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any unit
            
1595

    
owner or holder of a security interest.  The insurer issuing the policy may not cancel or refuse
            
1596

    
to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been
            
1597

    
mailed to the association, each unit owner and each holder of a security interest to whom a
            
1598

    
certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last-known
            
1599

    
addresses.
            
1600

    
    (8) (a)  Any portion of the common interest community for which insurance is required
            
1601

    
under this section which is damaged or destroyed must be repaired or replaced promptly by the
            
1602

    
association unless:
            
1603

    
    (i)  the common interest community is terminated, in which case Section 

57-8a-318


            
1604

    
applies;
            
1605

    
    (ii)  repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local statute or ordinance
            
1606

    
governing health or safety; or
            
1607

    
    (iii)  80% of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or assigned limited
            
1608

    
common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.

            
1609


    
    (b)  The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a
            
1610

    
common expense.  If the entire common interest community is not repaired or replaced:
            
1611

    
    (i)  the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used
            
1612

    
to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the common
            
1613

    
interest community; and
            
1614

    
    (ii)  except to the extent that other persons will be distributees:
            
1615

    
    (A)  the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are
            
1616

    
not rebuilt must be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which
            
1617

    
those limited common elements were allocated, or to lien holders, as their interests may appear;
            
1618

    
and
            
1619

    
    (B)  the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the unit owners or lien
            
1620

    
holders, as their interests may appear, as follows:
            
1621

    
    (I)  in a condominium, in proportion to the common element interests of all the units;
            
1622

    
and
            
1623

    
    (II)  in a cooperative or planned community, in proportion to the common expense
            
1624

    
liabilities of all the units.
            
1625

    
    (c)  If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are
            
1626

    
automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under Subsection
            
1627

    


57-8a-107

(1), and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to
            
1628

    
the declaration reflecting the reallocations.
            
1629

    
    (9)  The provisions of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a common
            
1630

    
interest community all of whose units are restricted to nonresidential use.
            
1631

    
    Section 61.  
Section  
57-8a-414

 is enacted to read:
            
1632

    
     57-8a-414.  Surplus funds.
            
1633

    
    Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, any surplus funds of the association
            
1634

    
remaining after payment of or provision for common expenses and any prepayment of reserves
            
1635

    
must be paid to the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liabilities or credited to
            
1636

    
them to reduce their future common expense assessments.
            
1637

    
    Section 62.  
Section  
57-8a-415

 is enacted to read:
            
1638

    
     57-8a-415.  Assessment for common expense.
            
1639

    
    (1)  Until the association makes a common expense assessment, the declarant shall pay

            
1640


    
all common expenses.  After an assessment has been made by the association, assessments
            
1641

    
must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association.
            
1642

    
    (2)  Except for assessments under Subsections (3), (4), and (5), all common expenses
            
1643

    
must be assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations set forth in the
            
1644

    
declaration pursuant to Subsections 

57-8a-307

(1) and (2).  Any past due common expense
            
1645

    
assessment or installment thereof bears interest at the rate established by the association not
            
1646

    
exceeding 18% per year.
            
1647

    
    (3)  To the extent required by the declaration:
            
1648

    
    (a)  any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a
            
1649

    
limited common element must be assessed against the units to which that limited common
            
1650

    
element is assigned, equally, or in any other proportion the declaration provides;
            
1651

    
    (b)  any common expense or portion thereof benefiting fewer than all of the units must
            
1652

    
be assessed exclusively against the units benefitted; and
            
1653

    
    (c)  the costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk and the costs of
            
1654

    
utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage.
            
1655

    
    (4)  Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against
            
1656

    
the units in the common interest community at the time the judgment was entered, in
            
1657

    
proportion to their common expense liabilities.
            
1658

    
    (5)  If any common expense is caused by the misconduct of any unit owner, the
            
1659

    
association may assess that expense exclusively against his unit.
            
1660

    
    (6)  If common expense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and
            
1661

    
any installment thereof not yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated
            
1662

    
common expense liabilities.
            
1663

    
    Section 63.  
Section  
57-8a-416

 is enacted to read:
            
1664

    
     57-8a-416.  Lien for assessments.
            
1665

    
    (1)  The association has a statutory lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that
            
1666

    
unit or fines imposed against its unit owner.  Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees,
            
1667

    
charges, late charges, fines, and interest charged pursuant to Subsections 

57-8a-402

(1)(j)
            
1668

    
through (l) are enforceable as assessments under this section.  If an assessment is payable in
            
1669

    
installments, the lien is for the full amount of the assessment from the time the first installment
            
1670

    
thereof becomes due.

            
1671


    
    (2) (a)  A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit
            
1672

    
except:
            
1673

    
    (i)  liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a
            
1674

    
cooperative, liens and encumbrances which the association creates, assumes, or takes subject
            
1675

    
to;
            
1676

    
    (ii)  a first security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment
            
1677

    
sought to be enforced became delinquent, or, in a cooperative, the first security interest
            
1678

    
encumbering only the unit owner's interest and perfected before the date on which the
            
1679

    
assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and
            
1680

    
    (iii)  liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against
            
1681

    
the unit or cooperative.
            
1682

    
    (b)  The lien is also prior to all security interests described in Subsection (2)(a)(ii) to the
            
1683

    
extent of the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the
            
1684

    
association pursuant to Subsection 

57-8a-415

(1) which would have become due in the absence
            
1685

    
of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce
            
1686

    
the lien.  This Subsection (2) does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens,
            
1687

    
or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.
            
1688

    
    (3)  Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens
            
1689

    
for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority.
            
1690

    
    (4)  Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. 
            
1691

    
No further recordation of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required.
            
1692

    
    (5)  A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien
            
1693

    
are instituted within three years after the full amount of the assessments becomes due.
            
1694

    
    (6)  This section does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which Subsection (1)
            
1695

    
creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
            
1696

    
    (7)  A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section must include costs
            
1697

    
and reasonable attorney's fees for the prevailing party.
            
1698

    
    (8)  The association upon written request shall furnish to a unit owner a statement
            
1699

    
setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against the unit.  If the unit owner's interest is
            
1700

    
real estate, the statement must be in recordable form.  The statement must be furnished within
            
1701

    
ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive

            
1702


    
board, and every unit owner.
            
1703

    
    (9)  In a cooperative, upon nonpayment of an assessment on a unit, the unit owner may
            
1704

    
be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a
            
1705

    
commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided by this section.
            
1706

    
    (10)  The association's lien may be foreclosed as provided in this Subsection (10):
            
1707

    
    (a)  in a condominium or planned community, the association's lien must be foreclosed
            
1708

    
in like manner as a mortgage on real estate;
            
1709

    
    (b)  in a cooperative whose unit owners' interests in the units are real estate, the
            
1710

    
association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real estate; or
            
1711

    
    (c)  in a cooperative whose unit owners' interests in the units are personal property, the
            
1712

    
association's lien must be foreclosed in like manner as a security interest under Title 70A,
            
1713

    
Chapter 9a, Uniform Commercial Code - Secured Transactions.
            
1714

    
    (11)  In a cooperative, if the unit owner's interest in a unit is real estate:
            
1715

    
    (a)  The association, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this
            
1716

    
Subsection (11), may sell that unit at a public sale or by private negotiation, and at any time
            
1717

    
and place.  Every aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising, time, place, and terms
            
1718

    
must be reasonable.  The association shall give to the unit owner and any lessees of the unit
            
1719

    
owner reasonable written notice of the time and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is
            
1720

    
intended, of the intention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time after which a private
            
1721

    
disposition may be made.  The same notice must also be sent to any other person who has a
            
1722

    
recorded interest in the unit which would be cut off by the sale, but only if the recorded interest
            
1723

    
was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale
            
1724

    
or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may
            
1725

    
be made.  The notices required by this Subsection (11) may be sent to any address reasonable
            
1726

    
in the circumstances.  Sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. 
            
1727

    
The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other
            
1728

    
person not related to the association, at a private sale.
            
1729

    
    (b)  Unless otherwise agreed, the debtor is liable for any deficiency in a foreclosure
            
1730

    
sale.
            
1731

    
    (c)  The proceeds of a foreclosure sale must be applied in the following order:
            
1732

    
    (i)  the reasonable expenses of sale;

            
1733


    
    (ii)  the reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; holding, maintaining,
            
1734

    
and preparing the unit for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental charges,
            
1735

    
premiums on hazard and liability insurance, and, to the extent provided for by agreement
            
1736

    
between the association and the unit owner, reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses
            
1737

    
incurred by the association;
            
1738

    
    (iii)  satisfaction of the association's lien;
            
1739

    
    (iv)  satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and
            
1740

    
    (v)  remittance of any excess to the unit owner.
            
1741

    
    (d)  A good faith purchaser for value acquires the unit free of the association's debt that
            
1742

    
gave rise to the lien under which the foreclosure sale occurred and any subordinate interest,
            
1743

    
even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with the
            
1744

    
requirements of this section.  The person conducting the sale shall execute a conveyance to the
            
1745

    
purchaser sufficient to convey the unit and stating that it is executed by him after a foreclosure
            
1746

    
of the association's lien by power of sale and that he was empowered to make the sale. 
            
1747

    
Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of
            
1748

    
the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required by this
            
1749

    
Subsection (11) are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of his authority to sign.  Further
            
1750

    
proof of authority is not required even though the association is named as grantee in the
            
1751

    
conveyance.
            
1752

    
    (e)  At any time before the association has disposed of a unit in a cooperative or entered
            
1753

    
into a contract for its disposition under the power of sale, the unit owners or the holder of any
            
1754

    
subordinate security interest may cure the unit owner's default and prevent sale or other
            
1755

    
disposition by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any
            
1756

    
amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of
            
1757

    
proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorney's fees of
            
1758

    
the creditor.
            
1759

    
    (12)  In an action by an association to collect assessments or to foreclose a lien for
            
1760

    
unpaid assessments, the court may appoint a receiver to collect all sums alleged to be due and
            
1761

    
owing to a unit owner before commencement or during pendency of the action.  The
            
1762

    
receivership is governed by any state law generally applicable to receiverships.  The court may
            
1763

    
order the receiver to pay any sums held by the receiver to the association during pendency of

            
1764


    
the action to the extent of the association's common expense assessments based on a periodic
            
1765

    
budget adopted by the association pursuant to Section 

57-8a-415

.
            
1766

    
    Section 64.  
Section  
57-8a-417

 is enacted to read:
            
1767

    
     57-8a-417.  Other liens.
            
1768

    
    (1)  In a condominium or planned community:
            
1769

    
    (a)  Except as provided in Subsection (1)(b), a judgment for money against the
            
1770

    
association if recorded is not a lien on the common elements, but is a lien in favor of the
            
1771

    
judgment lien holder against all of the units in the common interest community at the time the
            
1772

    
judgment was entered.  No other property of a unit owner is subject to the claims of creditors of
            
1773

    
the association.
            
1774

    
    (b)  If the association has granted a security interest in the common elements to a
            
1775

    
creditor of the association pursuant to Section 

57-8a-412

, the holder of that security interest
            
1776

    
shall exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on any unit may
            
1777

    
be enforced.
            
1778

    
    (c)  Whether perfected before or after the creation of the common interest community,
            
1779

    
if a lien, other than a deed of trust or mortgage (including a judgment lien or lien attributable to
            
1780

    
work performed or materials supplied before creation of the common interest community),
            
1781

    
becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the
            
1782

    
lien holder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit, and the lien holder, upon receipt of
            
1783

    
payment, promptly shall deliver a release of the lien covering that unit.  The amount of the
            
1784

    
payment must be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner's common expense liability
            
1785

    
bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien. 
            
1786

    
After payment, the association may not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for
            
1787

    
any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.
            
1788

    
    (d)  A judgment against the association must be indexed in the name of the common
            
1789

    
interest community and the association and, when so indexed, is notice of the lien against the
            
1790

    
units.
            
1791

    
    (2)  In a cooperative:
            
1792

    
    (a)  If the association receives notice of an impending foreclosure on all or any portion
            
1793

    
of the association's real estate, the association shall promptly transmit a copy of that notice to
            
1794

    
each unit owner of a unit located within the real estate to be foreclosed.  Failure of the

            
1795


    
association to transmit the notice does not affect the validity of the foreclosure.
            
1796

    
    (b)  Whether or not a unit owner's unit is subject to the claims of the association's
            
1797

    
creditors, no other property of a unit owner is subject to those claims.
            
1798

    
    Section 65.  
Section  
57-8a-418

 is enacted to read:
            
1799

    
     57-8a-418.  Association records.
            
1800

    
    The association shall keep financial records sufficiently detailed to enable the
            
1801

    
association to comply with Subsection 

57-8a-416

(8).  All financial and other records must be
            
1802

    
made reasonably available for examination by any unit owner and his authorized agents.
            
1803

    
    Section 66.  
Section  
57-8a-419

 is enacted to read:
            
1804

    
     57-8a-419.  Association as trustee.
            
1805

    
    With respect to a third person dealing with the association in the association's capacity
            
1806

    
as a trustee, the existence of trust powers and their proper exercise by the association may be
            
1807

    
assumed without inquiry.  A third person is not bound to inquire whether the association has
            
1808

    
power to act as trustee or is properly exercising trust powers.  A third person, without actual
            
1809

    
knowledge that the association is exceeding or improperly exercising its powers, is fully
            
1810

    
protected in dealing with the association as if it possessed and properly exercised the powers it
            
1811

    
purports to exercise.  A third person is not bound to assure the proper application of trust assets
            
1812

    
paid or delivered to the association in its capacity as trustee.
