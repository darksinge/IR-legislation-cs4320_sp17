    (1)  When a decree of divorce is rendered, the court may include in it equitable orders
            
30

    
relating to the children, property, debts or obligations, and parties.  The court shall include the
            
31

    
following in every decree of divorce:
            
32

    
    (a)  an order assigning responsibility for the payment of reasonable and necessary
            
33

    
medical and dental expenses of the dependent children including responsibility for health
            
34

    
insurance out-of-pocket expenses such as co-payments, co-insurance, and deductibles;
            
35

    
    (b) (i)  if coverage is or becomes available at a reasonable cost, an order requiring the
            
36

37

    
dependent children; and
            
38

    
    (ii)  a designation of which health, hospital, or dental insurance plan is primary and

40

    
of Section 

30-3-5.4

 which will take effect if at any time a dependent child is covered by both
            
41

42

    
    (c)  pursuant to Section 

15-4-6.5

:
            
43

    
    (i)  an order specifying which party is responsible for the payment of joint debts,
            
44

    
obligations, or liabilities of the parties contracted or incurred during marriage;
            
45

    
    (ii)  an order requiring the parties to notify respective creditors or obligees, regarding

52

    
financial responsibility for all or a portion of child care expenses incurred on behalf of the
            
53

    
dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the custodial parent.  If the
            
54

    
court determines that the circumstances are appropriate and that the dependent children would
            
55

    
be adequately cared for, it may include an order allowing the noncustodial parent to provide
            
56

    
child care for the dependent children, necessitated by the employment or training of the
            
57

    
custodial parent.
            
58

    
    (3)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make subsequent changes or new orders for

60

    
distribution of the property and obligations for debts as is reasonable and necessary.
            
61

    
    (4)  Child support, custody, visitation, and other matters related to children born to the
            
62

    
mother and father after entry of the decree of divorce may be added to the decree by
            
63

    
modification.
            
64

    
    (5) (a)  In determining parent-time rights of parents and visitation rights of grandparents
            
65

    
and other members of the immediate family, the court shall consider the best interest of the
            
66

    
child.
            
67

    
    (b)  Upon a specific finding by the court of the need for peace officer enforcement, the
            
68

    
court may include in an order establishing a parent-time or visitation schedule a provision,
            
69

    
among other things, authorizing any peace officer to enforce a court-ordered parent-time or
            
70

    
visitation schedule entered under this chapter.
            
71

    
    (6)  If a petition for modification of child custody or parent-time provisions of a court
            
72

    
order is made and denied, the court shall order the petitioner to pay the reasonable attorneys'
            
73

    
fees expended by the prevailing party in that action, if the court determines that the petition
            
74

    
was without merit and not asserted or defended against in good faith.
            
75

    
    (7)  If a petition alleges noncompliance with a parent-time order by a parent, or a
            
76

    
visitation order by a grandparent or other member of the immediate family where a visitation or
            
77

    
parent-time right has been previously granted by the court, the court may award to the
            
78

    
prevailing party costs, including actual attorney fees and court costs incurred by the prevailing
            
79

    
party because of the other party's failure to provide or exercise court-ordered visitation or
            
80

    
parent-time.
            
81

    
    (8) (a)  The court shall consider at least the following factors in determining alimony:
            
82

    
    (i)  the financial condition and needs of the recipient spouse;
            
83

    
    (ii)  the recipient's earning capacity or ability to produce income;
            
84

    
    (iii)  the ability of the payor spouse to provide support;
            
85

    
    (iv)  the length of the marriage;
            
86

    
    (v)  whether the recipient spouse has custody of minor children requiring support;
            
87

    
    (vi)  whether the recipient spouse worked in a business owned or operated by the payor
            
88

    
spouse; and
            
89

    
    (vii)  whether the recipient spouse directly contributed to any increase in the payor

            
90


    
spouse's skill by paying for education received by the payor spouse or [allowing] enabling the
            
91

    
payor spouse to attend school during the marriage.
            
92

    
    (b)  The court may consider the fault of the parties in determining whether to award
            
93

    
alimony and the terms thereof.
            
94

    
    (c)  "Fault" means wrongful conduct during the marriage that substantially contributed
            
95

    
to the breakup of the marriage relationship, including:
            
96

    
    (i)  engaging in sexual relations with a person other than the party's spouse;
            
97

    
    (ii)  knowingly and intentionally causing or attempting to cause physical harm to the
            
98

    
other party or minor children;
            
99

    
    (iii)  knowingly and intentionally causing the other party or minor children to
            
100

    
reasonably fear life-threatening harm; or
            
101

    
    (iv)  substantially undermining the financial stability of the other party or the minor
            
102

    
children.
            
103

    
    (d)  The court may, when fault is at issue, close the proceedings and seal the court
            
104

    
records.
            
105

    
    [(c)] (e)  As a general rule, the court should look to the standard of living, existing at
            
106

    
the time of separation, in determining alimony in accordance with Subsection (8)(a).  However,
            
107

    
the court shall consider all relevant facts and equitable principles and may, in its discretion,
            
108

    
base alimony on the standard of living that existed at the time of trial.  In marriages of short
            
109

    
duration, when no children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may
            
110

    
consider the standard of living that existed at the time of the marriage.
            
111

    
    [(d)] (f)  The court may, under appropriate circumstances, attempt to equalize the
            
112

    
parties' respective standards of living.
            
113

    
    [(e)] (g)  When a marriage of long duration dissolves on the threshold of a major
            
114

    
change in the income of one of the spouses due to the collective efforts of both, that change
            
115

    
shall be considered in dividing the marital property and in determining the amount of alimony. 
            
116

    
If one spouse's earning capacity has been greatly enhanced through the efforts of both spouses
            
117

    
during the marriage, the court may make a compensating adjustment in dividing the marital
            
118

    
property and awarding alimony.
            
119

    
    [(f)] (h)  In determining alimony when a marriage of short duration dissolves, and no
            
120

    
children have been conceived or born during the marriage, the court may consider restoring

            
121


    
each party to the condition which existed at the time of the marriage.
            
122

    
    [(g)] (i) (i)  The court has continuing jurisdiction to make substantive changes and new
            
123

    
orders regarding alimony based on a substantial material change in circumstances not
            
124

    
foreseeable at the time of the divorce.
            
125

    
    (ii)  The court may not modify alimony or issue a new order for alimony to address
            
126

    
needs of the recipient that did not exist at the time the decree was entered, unless the court
            
127

    
finds extenuating circumstances that justify that action.
            
128

    
    (iii)  In determining alimony, the income of any subsequent spouse of the payor may not
            
129

    
be considered, except as provided in this Subsection (8).
            
130

    
    (A)  The court may consider the subsequent spouse's financial ability to share living
            
131

    
expenses.
            
132

    
    (B)  The court may consider the income of a subsequent spouse if the court finds that
            
133

    
the payor's improper conduct justifies that consideration.
            
134

    
    [(h)] (j)  Alimony may not be ordered for a duration longer than the number of years
            
135

    
that the marriage existed unless, at any time prior to termination of alimony, the court finds
            
136

    
extenuating circumstances that justify the payment of alimony for a longer period of time.
            
137

    
    (9)  Unless a decree of divorce specifically provides otherwise, any order of the court
            
138

    
that a party pay alimony to a former spouse automatically terminates upon the remarriage or
            
139

    
death of that former spouse.  However, if the remarriage is annulled and found to be void ab
            
140

    
initio, payment of alimony shall resume if the party paying alimony is made a party to the
            
141

    
action of annulment and [his] the payor party's rights are determined.
            
142

    
    (10)  Any order of the court that a party pay alimony to a former spouse terminates
            
143

    
upon establishment by the party paying alimony that the former spouse is cohabitating with
            
144

    
another person.
