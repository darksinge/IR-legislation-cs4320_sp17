Best and final offers.1370          (1)  The best and final offer process described in this section:1371          (a)  may be used only in a request for proposals process, whether the request for1372     proposals process is used independently or after the establishment of an approved vendor list1373     through the approved vendor list process; and1374          (b)  may not be used in any other standard procurement process, whether the other1375     standard procurement process is used independently or after the establishment of an approved1376     vendor list through the approved vendor list process.1377          (2)  Subject to Subsection (3), a conducting procurement unit may request best and final1378     offers from responsible offerors:1379          (a)  only with the approval of the chief procurement officer or the head of the issuing1380     procurement unit;

or1399          (b)  a determination that a proposal is not responsive to a determination that the1400     proposal is responsive.1401          (5) (a)  This Subsection (5) applies if a request for best and final offers is issued1402     because all cost proposals exceed the identified budget or the procurement unit's available1403     funding.1404          (b) (i)  The conducting procurement unit may, in the request for best and final offers:1405          (A)  specify the scope of work reductions the procurement unit is making in order to1406     generate proposals that are within the identified budget or the procurement unit's available1407     funding;

or1419          (ii)  alter the nature of the original request for proposals to the extent that a request for1420     proposals for the reduced scope of work would have likely attracted a significantly different set1421     of offerors submitting proposals in response to the request for proposals.1422          (6)  If a request for best and final offers is issued because two or more proposals1423     received an identical evaluation score that is the highest score:1424          (a)  the request may be issued only to offerors who submitted a proposal receiving the1425     highest score; and1426          (b)  an offeror submitting a best and final offer may revise:1427          (i)  the technical aspects of the offeror's proposal;1428          (ii)  the offeror's cost proposal, as provided in Subsection (5);

and1435          (ii)  how best and final offers will be evaluated and scored in accordance with Section1436     63G-6a-707;1437          (b)  establish a deadline for an offeror to submit a best and final offer; and1438          (c)  if applicable, establish a schedule and procedure for conducting discussions with1439     offerors concerning the best and final offers.1440          (8)  In conducting a best and final offer process under this section, a conducting1441     procurement unit shall:1442          (a)  maintain confidential the information the procurement unit receives from an1443     offeror, including any cost information, until a contract has been awarded or the request for1444     proposals canceled;1445          (b)  ensure that each offeror receives fair and equal treatment; and1446          (c)  safeguard the integrity of the scope of the original request for proposals, except as1447     specifically provided otherwise in this section.1448          (9)  In a best and final offer, an offeror:1449          (a)  may address only the issues described in the request for best and final offers; and1450          (b)  may not correct a material error or deficiency in the offeror's proposal or address1451     any issue not described in the request for best and final offers.1452          (10)  If an offeror fails to submit a best and final offer, the conducting procurement unit1453     shall treat the offeror's original proposal as the offeror's best and final offer.1454          (11)  After the deadline for submitting best and final offers has passed, the evaluation1455     committee shall evaluate the best and final offers submitted using the criteria described in the1456     request for proposals.1457          (12)  An offeror may not make and a conducting procurement unit may not consider a1458     best and final offer that the conducting procurement unit has not requested under this section.1459          (13)  To implement the best and final offer process described in this section, an1460     applicable rulemaking authority may make rules consistent with this section and the other1461     provisions of this chapter.1462          Section 19.
