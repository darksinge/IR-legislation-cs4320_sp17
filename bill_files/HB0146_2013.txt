59


    
follows:

may enter into contracts with health care providers as defined in Section 

78B-3-403

62

63

    
persons insured by an insurer.

    (v)  If an insurer permits another entity with which it does not share common ownership
            
78

    
or control to use or otherwise lease one or more of the organization's networks of participating
            
79

    
providers, the organization shall ensure, at a minimum, that the entity pays participating
            
80

    
providers in accordance with the same fee schedule and general payment policies as the
            
81

    
organization would for that network.
            
82

    
    (b)  The insurance contract may reward the insured for selection of preferred health care

125

    
    (2) (a)  Subject to Subsections (2)(b) through (2)(f), an insurer using preferred health
            
126

    
care provider contracts shall pay for the services of health care providers not under the contract,

    (ii)  Notwithstanding Subsection (2)(b)(i), an insurer may offer a health plan that
            
137

    
complies with the provisions of Subsection 

31A-22-618.5

(3).
            
138

    
    (iii)  The commissioner may adopt a rule dealing with the determination of what

150

    (i)  refusal to contract with class members in reasonable proportion to the number of

            
152


    
insureds covered by the insurer and the expected demand for services from class members; and

171

    
assurance program for assuring that the care provided by the health care providers under
            
172

    
contract meets prevailing standards in the state.
            
173

    
    (b)  The commissioner in consultation with the executive director of the Department of

177

    
    (c)  The information contained in the medical records of individual patients shall

injury unless the health care provider is licensed to perform that treatment.
            
188

    
    (7) (a)  A health care provider or insurer may not discriminate against a preferred health
            
189
