231

    
changing them is warranted and in the public interest, except that a time frame may not be
            
232

    
lengthened solely because an independent evaluator is not available to participate or to

complete a recommendation.

Subsection 

54-4-4

(4); and
            
241

    
    (c)  the waiver grant does not create any presumption that the affected electrical utility's
            
242

    
action in acquiring or constructing a significant energy resource was prudent.
            
243

    
    (11) (a)  Subject to Subsection (11)(b), the commission shall use reasonable efforts to

part.
            
246

    
    (b)  The commission may decline to use an independent evaluator in the consideration
            
247

248

    
    (i)  not appropriate under the circumstances;
            
249

    
    (ii)  not available under terms or conditions the commission considers reasonable; or
            
250

established under Subsection (4), (6), (7), or (9).

254


    
    (ii)  the failure of an independent evaluator to participate or complete a
            
255

    
recommendation within any time frame established under Subsection (4), (6), (7), or (9).
            
256

    
    (12)  The commission shall issue a generic protective order as provided in Subsections
            
257

    
(2)(b) and (8)(b).

    (13)  By September 1, 2007, the commission shall, in accordance with Title 63, Chapter
            
259
